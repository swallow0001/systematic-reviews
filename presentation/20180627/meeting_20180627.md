# Meeting - Progress

Jonathan de Bruin and Parise Zahedi

# What we did last weeks

- Compared available active learning packages

- Compared passive learning and active learning

- Experimented with classical models and Neural Networks for text classification

- Trying to deal with unbalanced labels

- Explored different query strategies 

- Studied the Burr Setlles paper

# Unbalanced labels and Neural Networks

- [image by Parisa]

# Used packages

- google/active-learning (Python)

- ntucllab/libact (Python)
  *libact: Pool-based Active Learning in Python (Yang et al. 2017)*

- ramhiser/activelearning (R)

# Demonstration

- Digits dataset with binary labels.

- Systematic review dataset with classical model.

# Questions and research directions

- Should we divide the data into a train and test set? 
  - No need to generalize the model, isn't it?

- Unbalanced labels
  - How to deal with this? 

- Stopping criteria


# Notes

1) treshold above 0
2) Number of FN should not exceed 1%
3) Total number of paper + the number of paper you already saw should not exceed 500

At least 5 iterations meeting stopping criteria
