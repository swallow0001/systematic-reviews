Adequacy of analgesia, lower limb motor block and side-effects were assessed four hourly postoperatively.; Both infusion regimens provided excellent analgesia (median objective pain scores = 0). Epidural infusion rates were similar in the F (0.29 +/- 0.07 ml.kg-1.hr-1) and F-B (0.26 +/- 0.05 ml.kg-1.hr-1) groups. Three children in the F group and all children in the F-B group developed lower limb weakness. (P < 0.05) Bromage scores were different in the F group (median 0, range 0-0.66) compared with the F-B group (median 0.33, range 0-1) (P < 0.001). Other side-effects did not differ.; Postoperative epidural fentanyl infusion provides equipotent analgesia to administration of a solution including both fentanyl and bupivacaine 0.125% and causes less lower limb weakness. No reduction in the fentanyl requirement resulted from the addition of bupivacaine 0.125%.",E,E

Chronic pain was felt to be a significant problem amongst patients with SCI, with inconsistent opinion between respondents regarding prevalence, aetiology and classification of chronic pain after spinal cord injury. Only one unit had established protocols for the investigation and management of pain, and most units felt that guidelines would be useful. Most felt that there was a need for further information on the subject.; Our survey has demonstrated the uncertainty that exists amongst specialists dealing with pain after SCI, and emphasised the need for more research into the problem.",E,E

Our aim in this study was to evaluate the prophylactic effect of dixyrazine, a phenothiazine with proven anti-emetic properties.; The incidence of nausea and vomiting was studied in 60 children using PCA after major surgery. The patients were randomised to receive either dixyrazine 0.25 mg kg-1 or placebo on the induction of anaesthesia in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. The anaesthetic technique was standardised. The PCA pump was programmed to deliver bolus doses of morphine of 20 micrograms kg-1 with a continuous background infusion of 8-10 micrograms kg-1 h-1. Nausea, vomiting, sedation and pain scores were noted every 3 h for a period of 24 h.; The morphine consumption of morphine was the same in both groups. During the stay in the recovery room the incidence of vomiting was 3% in the dixyrazine group compared to 30% in the placebo group (P < 0.05). On the ward, 57% versus 83% of the children vomited (P < 0.05). Rescue antiemetics were significantly lower, 30%, in the dixyrazine group compared to 60% in the placebo group (P < 0.05). Higher sedation scores were recorded for the dixyrazine group in the recovery room. No other adverse effects were found.; A significant number of children using PCA with morphine after major surgery experience PONV. Although prophylactic dixyrazine reduces the incidence and severity of vomiting, the incidence still remains high.",E,E

(R)-ketamine in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. (R)-ketamine was used due to the lower incidence of side-effects.; Sixty patients who underwent surgery under general anesthesia were randomly allocated to 3 groups and studied in a double-blind manner. Two i.v. injections were administered: one after induction of anesthesia, approximately 3 min before surgery, and one after surgery. The placebo group (PLA, n = 20) received saline in both injections. The preoperative group (PRE, n = 20) received (R)-ketamine 1 mg/kg and then saline. The postoperative group (POST, n = 20) received saline and then (R)-ketamine 1 mg/kg. Postoperatively, the patients used a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. Pain was evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS) at 30 min and every hour for 4 h and with a verbal rating scale (VRS) at 24 h and after 7 days.; There were no occurrence of side-effects from (R)-ketamine. VAS and VRS at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h postoperatively showed no statistical differences. In the POST group, extubation was delayed and pain score (VAS) at 30 min postoperatively was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than the two other groups. There were no statistical differences in meperidine consumption during the first 4 h postoperatively and no differences in consumption of analgesics at 24 h and 7 days.; In this study a 1 mg/kg dose of (R)-ketamine given at the end of surgery exerted a short-lasting hypnotic and analgesic effect. The same dose given preoperatively did not show postoperative analgesic effect or pre-emptive effect.",E,E

Sonography facilitates differentiation between a haemarthrosis, intraperitoneal haemorrhage, subperiosteal bleed, a bleed into the soft tissue around the hip joint or a psoas haematoma. All these aforementioned causes may result in the same clinical presentation. Two cases are described in which coxhaemarthrosis resulted in a flexion contracture of the joint associated with severe intractable pain. Narcotic drugs failed to alleviate the severe pain. Joint aspiration produced dramatic pain relief and early joint rehabilitation.",E,E

Recently, we showed that placebos may also produce respiratory depressant responses, a typical side-effect of narcotics, when a subject had a prior experience of respiratory depression in the course of narcotic treatment. In the present study, we report that the placebo respiratory depression can be induced after repeated administrations of the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine. The placebo respiratory depressant effect that resulted from the buprenorphine conditioning was completely blocked by a dose of 10 mg of naloxone, indicating that it was mediated by endogenous opioids. These findings show that placebos act, via the activation of opioid receptors, not only on pain mechanisms but on the respiratory centres as well, thus mimicking a typical side-effect of narcotics. In addition, the experimental procedure we used did not produce any expectation of respiratory depression and, similarly, the subjects did not notice any sign of respiratory discomfort. Thus, the placebo respiratory depression elicited in the present study cannot be explained on the basis of cognitive or motivational mechanisms. Rather, it appears to be a sequence effect due to learning, thus suggesting a conditioning mechanism mediated by endogenous opioids.",E,E

It is undergoing investigation as a treatment for cancer-related breakthrough pain, a prevalent phenomenon defined as a transitory flare of moderate to severe pain that interrupts otherwise controlled persistent pain. There have been no controlled trials of other treatments for this condition. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ascending doses of OTFC, a novel controlled dose titration methodology was developed that applied blinding and randomization procedures to the evaluation of recurrent pains in the home environment. The study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind dose titration study in ambulatory cancer patients. The sample comprised adult patients receiving a scheduled oral opioid regimen equivalent to 60-1000 mg oral morphine per day, who were experiencing at least one episode per day of breakthrough pain and had achieved at least partial relief of this pain by use of an oral opioid rescue dose. After collection of 2 days of baseline data concerning the efficacy of the usual rescue drug, patients were randomly treated with either 200 or 400 microg OTFC unit doses in double-blind fashion. Up to two breakthrough pains each day could be treated with up to four OTFC unit doses per pain. OTFC in unit doses containing 200, 400, 600, 800, 1200 or 1600 microg of fentanyl citrate were available for the study. The unit dose was titrated upward in steps until the patient had 2 consecutive days on which breakthrough pain could be treated with the single unit dose, titration was ineffective at a 1600 microg unit dose, or 20 days elapsed. To maintain the double-blind, orders to titrate up were ignored one-third of the time according to a pre-defined randomization schedule accessible only to an unblinded study pharmacist. Main outcome measures included, numeric or categorical measures of pain intensity, pain relief, and global assessment of drug performance. Dose response relationships were found suggesting that the methodology was sensitive to opioid effects. Seventy-four percent of patients were successfully titrated. There was no relationship between the total daily dose of the fixed schedule opioid regimen and the dose of OTFC required to manage the breakthrough pain. Although the study was not designed to provide a definitive comparison between OTFC and the usual rescue drug, exploratory analyses found that OTFC provided significantly greater analgesic effect at 15, 30 and 60 min, and a more rapid onset of effect, than the usual rescue drug. Adverse effects of the OTFC were typically opioid-related, specifically somnolence, nausea and dizziness. Very few adverse events were severe or serious. This study demonstrated the feasibility of controlled trial methodology in studies of breakthrough pain. OTFC appears to be a safe and effective therapy for breakthrough pain, and dose titration can usually identify a unit dose capable of providing adequate analgesia. If the lack of a relationship between the effective OTFC dose and fixed schedule opioid regimen is confirmed, dose titration may be needed in the clinical use of this formulation. Further investigation of OTFC as a specific treatment for breakthrough pain is warranted.",E,E

Interviews with patients, chart reviews, and interviews with nurse leaders were used to examine institutional and individual approaches to pain management.; Twenty-eight percent of patients did not recall an explanation of a pain management plan, and 64% were often in moderate to severe pain while in the intensive care unit. High pain intensity correlated with wait for an analgesic (P < .001), expectations of less pain (P < .001), and longer stay in the intensive care unit (P < .001). Low satisfaction correlated with expectations of less pain (P < .001), often being in moderate to severe pain (P < .001), and long wait for an analgesic (P < .001). In the first 24 hours postoperatively, only 54% of patients had a numerical pain rating documented; 91% had a pain description. The amount of opioid given on postoperative day 1 was influenced by pain intensity (P < .001), the patient's age (P = .03), type of surgery (P = .002), and route of analgesic (P < .001). Only 33% of patients had nonpharmacological pain interventions documented.; Despite moderate to severe pain, patients are generally satisfied with their pain relief. Measuring patients' satisfaction alone is not a reliable outcome for determining the effectiveness of pain management. Realistic expectations of patients about their pain may enhance coping, increase satisfaction, and decrease pain intensity after surgery.",E,E

Analgesic efficacy was evaluated by a global pain score, pain intensity (visual analogue scale), and analgesic requirements (paracetamol) during the first 48 h postoperatively.; No significant differences between the groups were found for any of the efficacy variables. A majority of the patients had mild pain throughout the study, thus possibly compromising study sensitivity. In a subgroup with more intense pain early after arthroscopy, intra-articular morphine 2 mg reduced pain intensity (P < 0.05) and analgesic requirements (P < 0.05) compared with placebo.; Postoperative analgesic effect of intra-articular morphine was found only in a subgroup of patients with higher pain intensity in the immediate postanaesthetic period. Possible reasons for our overall negative findings include low study sensitivity due to weak pain stimulus, lack of inflammation that may be a prerequisite for peripheral opioid analgesia, and the local anaesthetic, which impedes local inflammatory reaction and expression of peripheral opioid receptors. These factors may also explain the conflicting results in other studies.",E,E

Opioid analgesics have been underused in the management of pain. Opioids have a higher analgesic potency and wider range of indications than any of the other currently available medications for pain control. The second class of drugs, the nonopioid analgesics and adjuvants, has recently expanded to include new and potentially beneficial medications.

Haemodynamic and respiratory parameters, anaesthetic requirements, recovery time and pain score were monitored for 24 h. Eleven children in group 1 and nine children in group 2 did not need any supplementary systemic analgesics throughout the 24-h observation period. Mean (+/- SD) duration of analgesia in the remaining patients was 6.3 h (+/- 3.3 h) in group 1 and 7.1 h (+/- 3.4 h) in group 2 (P = 0.43). Recovery time after anaesthesia was significantly longer in group 1 (16.6 +/- 8.8 min) than in group 2 (11.5 +/- 4.7 min) (P < 0.05). We conclude that analgesia provided by 1 microgram kg-1 clonidine added to caudal bupivacaine is comparable with that provided by 30 micrograms kg-1 caudal morphine with bupivacaine. Clonidine at this low dose did not cause respiratory depression.",E,E

One hundred forty-eight patients received open-label sumatriptan for 12 months for the treatment of migraine. Medical records were reviewed to obtain information on the frequency of migraine-related health care use during the 12 months before and during sumatriptan treatment. Patients completed questionnaires on their productivity at work, health-related quality of life, and satisfaction with medication at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months of sumatriptan treatment. For each migraine, patients recorded pain severity scores before and after taking sumatriptan and the time between dosing and onset of meaningful relief. Sumatriptan was associated with significant reductions in migraine-related use of general outpatient services, telephone calls, urgent care services, and emergency department visits (P < 0.05); a significant increase in the use of pharmacy services (P < 0.05); and significant and sustained improvements in health-related quality-of-life scores compared with baseline (P < 0.001). Patients lost significantly less time from work and were significantly more satisfied with sumatriptan compared with their usual therapy (P < 0.05). Two hours after dosing, 81% of patients experienced reduction of moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, and 90% of all patients experienced meaningful relief of pain. The use of sumatriptan for 12 months in an HMO was associated with reductions in health care use and improved health-related quality of life, productivity, and patient satisfaction with medication.",E,E

A prospective, randomized, double-blinded study design was used. Patients recovering from abdominal surgery were assigned to one of three treatment groups for a study period of 48 h. After titration of an individual loading dose, patients could self-administer 1 mL bolus doses (2 mg of morphine, 20 mg of tramadol or placebo) using a PCA device. Patients responding or not responding to the treatment were identified. In non-responders the escape medication was morphine. There were 96 responders and 65 non-responders. All responders showed similar pain scores, irrespective of the drug they received. Drug consumption of placebo responders was twice as high as that of opioid responders. Pain scores and analgesic consumption of non-responders were significantly higher compared with responders, although those patients received morphine. The loading dose correlated with subsequent analgesic consumption. Altogether, 89.2% of the non-responders were identified after the loading dose. Size of loading dose and pain scores during the first 30 min are useful for assessing the overall response to post-operative pain management. These factors may be valuable for predicting individual pain management.",E,E

The principal outcome measure, based on pilot studies, was the number of patients who were pain free without the permitted rescue medication (tramadol) for 5 days out of the last week. The treatment and placebo groups were well matched in physical characteristics, in the severity of pain, duration, nature and accompaniments of their pain, the Arhus low back pain index and in laboratory indices of organ system function. A total of 183 patients completed the study. The numbers of pain-free patients were three, six and 10 in the placebo group (P), the Harpagophytum 600 group (H600) and the Harpagophytum 1200 group (H1200) respectively (P = 0.027, one-tailed Cochrane-Armitage test). The majority of responders' were patients who had suffered less than 42 days of pain, and subgroup analyses suggested that the effect was confined to patients with more severe and radiating pain accompanied by neurological deficit. However, subsidiary analyses, concentrating on the current pain component of the Arhus index, painted a slightly different picture, with the benefits seeming, if anything, to be greatest in the H600 group and in patients without more severe pain, radiation or neurological deficit. Patients with more pain tended to use more tramadol, but even severe and unbearable pain would not guarantee that tramadol would be used at all, and certainly not to the maximum permitted dose. There was no evidence for Harpagophytum-related side-effects, except possibly for mild and infrequent gastrointestinal symptoms.",E,E

Opioid analgesics have become the mainstay in the treatment of cancer pain whilst inter-disciplinary pain management programmes are the generally accepted approach to chronic pain of non-malignant origin. Recently some pain specialists have advocated the use of opioids in the long-term management of non-cancer pain. This has raised some fundamental questions about the purpose of pain management. Is it best to opt for maximum pain relief and comfort, or should one emphasise function and activity as higher priorities? Will the use of opioids create more autonomy for pain sufferers or will this add handicaps to lives which are already limited? Until more clinical outcome data are available we advocate caution in the use of opioid analgesia. Such caution can, and does, raise questions about the rights of the patient and the rights of the prescriber in a context where the facts do not point to a clear course of action.",E,E

In most settings, the model of acute pain treatment, with its emphasis on pharmacological therapy, is used for acute and chronic pain alike. Persistent chronic pain, however, often leads to complex social and psychological maladaptations, as well as substantial direct and indirect costs. Thus, the proper treatment of chronic pain usually involves pharmacological, behavioural and psychological interventions. Pain is a subjective sensation, but persistent chronic pain often results in long term neurophysiological and psychological changes that might be more appropriately considered disease manifestations. Unfortunately, the subjectivity of pain has meant that the assessment of the epidemiology, pharmacotherapy and economic costs of chronic pain has been difficult. As a result, many of the techniques for chronic pain management are unfamiliar to practising physicians. Even those healthcare professionals who are familiar with the special techniques for the management of chronic pain may be unable to identify the subpopulations for which they might be most effective. The clinician must evaluate patients for the appropriateness of a number of alternative drug delivery methods, novel analgesic agents, neuromodulatory techniques and multidisciplinary behavioural and psychological treatment programmes. The most effective treatment will often involve a combination of these techniques, as determined by the unique features of the patient's pain condition as well as individual patient characteristics. The costs and outcomes of various treatment strategies vary considerably and there is a need for comparative studies. Increasing emphasis on diagnosis and treatment in the primary care setting will place more importance on knowing the relative efficacies and appropriate use of a widening array of choices for chronic pain treatment. The management of chronic pain is remarkably complex and resource-intensive, and there is clearly a need for more intensive pharmacoeconomic studies, especially those comparing the many alternative strategies for management.",E,E

Palliative Care Advisory Committee.,"Analgesics, Opioid; Costs and Cost Analysis; Decision Support Techniques; Health Care Costs; Humans; Neoplasms; Palliative Care; Terminally Ill","Guest, J F; Hart, W M; Cookson, R F","We constructed a UK-based decision model of palliative care for terminally ill cancer patients who were switched from a weak to a strong opioid so that the expected direct healthcare costs in the UK could be estimated from the time a patient commenced a strong opioid until death.; Decision analysis techniques were used to estimate the expected total direct healthcare cost per patient, stratified according to the first choice of strong opioid. The model was based on prescription data on 1975 terminally ill cancer patients who were on the Intercontinental Medical Statistics database, Mediplus (IMS Ltd, Middlesex, England). Resource-use data were obtained from published literature, a Delphi Panel and an advisory panel with expertise in palliative care.; The expected cost of managing terminally ill cancer patients after they switched from a weak to a strong opioid ranged from 2391 pounds sterling (Pounds) to 3701 Pounds at 1995/1996 prices, depending primarily on the patient's duration of survival. Sensitivity analyses showed that the cost could be as low as 1500 Pounds or as high as 6000 Pounds, depending on resource use (at 1995/1996 prices). The key cost drivers were: hospice care, hospitalisation, general practitioner (GP) consultations and specialist nurse visits. In contrast, neither the choice of opioid nor managing constipation impacted substantially on the expected cost. Approximately two-thirds of the expected total cost was incurred by the UK National Health Service (NHS), with the remainder incurred by voluntary and charitable sectors. Hospice care and hospitalisation collectively accounted for between 50 and 80% of the expected costs. Management of patients in the community by the primary healthcare team accounted for between 10 and 40% of the costs. The acquisition cost of opioids accounted for between 2 and 8% of the expected cost and discounting the cost of these drugs sold to hospitals did not impact substantially on the total expected costs. The use of other resources such as antiemetics, NSAIDS, antidepressants and gastrointestinal drugs accounted for up to 3% of the expected cost.; The expected cost of palliative care in the UK healthcare setting ranged from approximately 2500 Pounds to 4000 Pounds (1500 Pounds to 6000 Pounds in the sensitivity analysis) depending on the length of survival after patients switch from weak to strong opioids. Since opioids account for only 2 to 8% of expected costs, factors other than economic issues, such as tolerability profile, patient preference and convenience of use, should form the basis of clinical decision-making between opioids with similar analgesic efficacy.",E,E

Although the total consumption of morphine during the 24-h study period was similar in the three groups, retrospectively patients who received nalmefene characterized their pain as less severe in the previous 24 h.; Compared with placebo, prophylactic administration of nalmefene significantly decreased the need for antiemetics and antipruritic medications in patients receiving intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with morphine.",2,E

Occurrence of early intraventricular hemorrhage within 24 to 72 hours after birth suggests a role of pain and stress in the multifactorial causation of severe intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia. We proposed that such neurologic outcomes in preterm neonates who require ventilatory support may be reduced by morphine analgesia or midazolam sedation compared with a placebo.; To define the incidence of clinical outcomes in the target study population, to estimate the effect size and adverse effects associated with analgesia and sedation, and to calculate the sample size for a definitive test of this hypothesis.; Sixty-seven preterm neonates were randomized in a pilot clinical trial from 9 centers. Neonates of 24 to 32 weeks gestation were eligible if they had been intubated and required ventilatory support for less than 8 hours and if they were enrolled within 72 hours after birth. Exclusion criteria included major congenital anomalies, severe intrapartum asphyxia, and participation in other research studies. Severity of illness was assessed by the Clinical Risk Index for Babies, and neonates were randomized to receive continuous infusions of morphine sulfate, midazolam hydrochloride, or 10% dextrose (placebo). Masked study medications were continued as long as clinically necessary, then weaned and stopped according to predefined criteria. Levels of sedation (COMFORT scores) and responses to pain (Premature Infant Pain Profile scores) were measured before, during, and 12 hours after discontinuation of drug infusion. Cranial ultrasound examinations were performed as part of routine practice, and poor neurologic outcomes were defined as neonatal death, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grade III or IV), or periventricular leukomalacia.; No significant differences occurred in the demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic variables related to mothers and neonates in the 3 groups or in the severity of illness at birth as measured by Clinical Risk Index for Babies scores. Two neonates in the placebo group and 1 neonate in the midazolam group died; no deaths occurred in the morphine group. Poor neurologic outcomes occurred in 24% of neonates in the placebo group, 32% in the midazolam group, and 4% in the morphine group (likelihood ratio chi2 = 7.04, P = .03). Secondary clinical outcomes and neurobehavioral outcomes at 36 weeks' postconceptional age were similar in the 3 groups. Responses elicited by endotracheal tube suction (Premature Infant Pain Profile scores) were significantly reduced during the morphine (P<.001) and midazolam (P = .002) infusions compared with the placebo group.; This pilot trial suggests that preemptive analgesia given by continuous low-dose morphine infusion may reduce the incidence of poor neurologic outcomes in preterm neonates who require ventilatory support. Limitations in the sample size of this pilot study suggest that these results should be confirmed in a large multicenter randomized trial.",E,E

We have in a recent study demonstrated that pethidine could be an interesting alternative to prilocaine in arthroscopy with local anaesthetic technique. Therefore, we investigated, in a controlled randomized double-blind study, the effect of three doses of pethidine compared with a standard local anaesthetic, in patients subjected to arthroscopic knee joint surgery. Ten patients in each group received 50 mg (P50), 100 mg (P100), 200 mg (P200) of pethidine or prilocaine (5 mg/ml) + adrenaline (4 mg/ml) (PC), injected intra-articularly (i.a.) before surgery. We measured pain intensity and discomfort during arthroscopy and pain intensity at rest and at movement, nausea and tiredness for 3 days post-operatively at regular intervals using the VAS-technique. We also measured the concentration of pethidine and its demethylated metabolite, norpethidine, in plasma by collecting blood samples at 20, 40, 60, 80, 140 and 200 min following injection, and in synovial fluid which was collected through the arthroscope at the start and the end of the surgery. It was found that significantly more patients in the P50 group (n = 6) needed general anaesthesia due to intense pain than those in the P100 group (n = 1), P200 group (n = 0) or the PC group (n = 1). The PC group required significantly more analgesics and had a significantly higher calculated total sum of pain scores at movement post-operatively, than the other three groups. The P200 group more often reported tiredness post-operatively than the other three groups. We conclude that 100 or 200 mg pethidine i.a. produces satisfactory anaesthesia for surgery. There was a rapid transfer of pethidine from synovial fluid to plasma, resulting in plasma levels earlier reported to produce centrally mediated effects, such as analgesia and tiredness. We found much higher concentrations of norpethidine in the synovial fluid than in plasma, suggesting a local demethylation in the knee joint tissues. This site of drug oxidation has not earlier been demonstrated neither in vitro nor in vivo. The results suggest that pethidine given i.a. in the dose range of 50 to 200 mg results in analgesia due to both peripheral and central mechanisms. The significant systemic uptake of pethidine can cause unwanted side-effects.",E,E

It was developed in reaction to the large number of unsatisfied postoperative patients suffering from moderate to severe pain despite the availability of potent analgesic drugs. With PCA, patients are allowed to self-administer small analgesic doses into a running intravenous infusion, intramuscularly, subcutaneously or even into the spinal space. Clinical experience soon demonstrated that individual variability in pain intensity and analgesic needs was extremely large. Psychological factors seem to be as important as the surgical trauma. Opioid consumption is usually higher than with conventional regimens, but without serious side effects. Although patients generally prefer self-control, pain relief is not necessarily better than with well-conducted conventional techniques. In addition to routine clinical pain management, PCA has proven its importance in research, e.g. for pain measurement, to determine predictors of postoperative pain, to evaluate drug interactions and the concept of pre-emptive analgesia, or for pharmacokinetic designs. PCA has been extremely important in order to change the mind of physicians and nursing staff with respect to individual pain management strategies.",E,E

We therefore evaluated the efficacy of a parenteral non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent, ketorolac, for the management of post-surgical pain.; Fifty three patients undergoing lumbar discectomy at a Medical School affiliated Veterans Administration hospital were randomly assigned to receive either: 1) 30 mg intramuscular ketorolac upon surgical closure and every 6 hours for 36 hours and narcotic analgesics as needed (PRN); or 2) only narcotic analgesics as needed. A blinded observer recorded the average, minimum and maximum postoperative pain intensity using a Numeric Pain Intensity Scale; total postoperative narcotic consumption, complications, length of hospitalization (from surgery to discharge) and outcome at 6 weeks.; The patients who received ketorolac reported significantly lower average (p < 0.001), minimum (p < 0.001), and maximum (p < 0.001) pain scores than patients receiving only narcotic analgesics. Cumulative narcotic doses (standardized to parenteral morphine) were significantly lower in the ketorolac group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between groups in the frequency of side effects, and no complication specifically associated with ketorolac use was observed. Mean length of hospitalization was significantly shorter (p = 0.05) in patients receiving ketorolac than in patients receiving only narcotics. Six weeks after surgery 5 (19.2%) patients who received only narcotics were troubled by persistent back pain. By contrast, all patients who received ketorolac were free of back pain at follow-up (p = 0.03).; These results suggest that ketorolac, when used with PRN narcotics, is more effective than PRN narcotics alone for postoperative pain following lumbar disc surgery. In addition, this strategy also may contribute to early discharge from hospital after lumbar disc surgery.",E,E

The wide distribution of opioid receptors probably accounts for the multiplicity of pharmacological responses elicited by morphine administration, as in addition to its strong analgesic potency morphine induces side effects. Therefore, there is a critical need for new analgesics able to fulfil the gap existing between opioid analgesics and antalgics. These new analgesics could be of major interest in a number of severe pain syndromes. The discovery that the endogenous morphine-like peptides enkephalins are degraded by well-defined metabolic pathways represents a promising outlook for the development of new analgesics. The complete inhibitors of enkephalin catabolism produce their physiological effects by increasing the extracellular levels of endogenous opioid peptides released either tonically or following stimuli-evoked depolarization. Under these conditions, their effects will depend upon the magnitude and duration of the enkephalin release evoked by a particular stimulus, which probably varies in the different enkephalinergic pathways. It is expected that increasing the levels of endogenous opioid peptides would avoid serious drawbacks inasmuch as they appear related to a ubiquitous overstimulation of brain opioid receptors. Some mixed inhibitors of enkephalin degrading enzymes are now undergoing preclinical trials.",E,E

The parent drug and glucuronide metabolites were measured simultaneously using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and native fluorescence detection. The mean morphine area under the curve (AUC) value (0-8 h) was smaller (434.3 +/- 170.2 nmolL(-1)h) in the oral administration than in the rectal administration (574.8 +/- 285.0 nmolL(-1)h) (p < 0.05).

Of importance, chronic pain seldom responds to the therapeutic measures that are successful in treating acute pain. Physicians who are unaware of these differences may label the patient with chronic pain as being neurotic or even a malingerer.

Premedication (temazepam and diclofenac), induction and maintenance of anaesthesia (thiopentone, atracurium, nitrous oxide and isoflurane), with controlled ventilation, were standardized. Variables monitored were heart rate (HR) and systolic arterial pressure (SAP) during surgery, time to recovery of spontaneous respiration at the termination of anaesthesia and restlessness, time to awakening, sedation and emesis in the recovery unit. Increases in HR or SAP > 33% of baseline during surgery were treated with esmolol 2.0 mg kg-1 intravenously (i.v.) and restlessness during recovery was treated with the same opioid i.v. given with an aesthesia, or pethidine i.v. in the placebo group. With placebo, there was a high requirement for esmolol during surgery and for pethidine in the recovery ward. Tramadol did not reduce the rate of intra-operative treatment with esmolol, but reduced the tramadol requirement during recovery (P < 0.05). Pethidine and nalbuphine reduced the intra-operative esmolol requirement more significantly (P < 0.025 and P < 0.005 respectively) and the need for treatment during recovery with opioids (P < 0.005 each). The time to recovery of spontaneous respiration at the end of anaesthesia was only delayed by pethidine. Other recovery variables were similar, except that restlessness-pain scores were reduced by tramadol (P < 0.02), pethidine (P < 0.005) and nalbuphine (P < 0.005). These results suggest that pethidine 1.5 mg kg-1 and nalbuphine 0.3 mg kg-1 given with induction of anaesthesia provide better analgesia during and after tonsillo-adenoidectomy than does tramadol 3.0 mg kg-1. The delay to recovery of spontaneous respiration with pethidine suggests a greater safety profile of nalbuphine and tramadol.",E,E

Sedation is used selectively in some countries but is routine in the United States.; Cross-sectional survey and randomized controlled trial were used to identify patient factors associated with willingness to try colonoscopy without sedation and to compare pain and satisfaction scores and willingness to return to the same physician in patients randomized to receive routine sedation versus as needed sedation. A single colonoscopist invited 250 consecutive eligible outpatients to be randomized to routine sedation versus as needed sedation. Seventeen who preferred no sedation and 163 who preferred sedation refused. Seventy accepted and were randomized.; Male gender (odds ratio 4.33; 95% CI [2.27, 8.26]), increasing age (odds ratio for 10-year increase 1.28; 95% CI [1.01, 1.06]), and absence of abdominal pain (odds ratio 5.13; 95% CI [1.68, 15.63]) were associated with willingness to be randomized. Total colonoscopy was achieved without sedation in 94% of those who received sedation only as needed. Pain scores were higher in the sedation as needed arm. All 35 patients in the routine sedation arm were ""very satisfied"". In the sedation as needed arm, 31 of the 34 were ""very satisfied"" and 3 were ""somewhat satisfied"". All randomized patients said they would return to the same colonoscopist.

We have undertaken a randomized, prospective double-blind trial of two different local anaesthetic regimes to evaluate the effect of this technique on post-thoracotomy pain relief and pulmonary function. Sixty-eight patients were randomized to receive bupivacaine 0.25% (n = 22), lignocaine 1% (n = 21) or 0.9% NaCl (saline) (n = 20) via an extrapleural catheter, inserted peroperatively. All patients underwent a standard posterolateral thoracotomy. Pain was assessed using a visual analogue pain score and by the requirement for opiate analgesia. Pulmonary function was measured using bedside spirometry. Pain scores were lower in the local anaesthetic groups at 24, 32 and 72 h compared with placebo (P < 0.05) and the total amount of opiate required was less than placebo for both lignocaine and bupivicaine (P < 0.05). Pulmonary function was better in the local anaesthetic groups throughout the post-operative period and was most pronounced at 24 h with a mean improvement of 30% for forced expiratory volume (FEV1), 24% for forced vital capacity (FVC) and 19% for peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) compared with placebo. There was no significant difference between pain scores, opiate requirement or pulmonary function between lignocaine and bupivicaine. CT scanning demonstrated containment of the local anaesthetic in an extra-pleural tunnel. Extra-pleural infusion of local anaesthetics is a simple technique, with low risk of complications and provides effective pain relief as well as an improvement in post-operative pulmonary function. Lignocaine is equally as effective as bupivacaine and its use would result in some cost-saving.",E,E

Recent studies report that epidural analgesia is associated with a lower catecholamine and cytokine response in patients undergoing elective thoracotomy compared with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). This study compares the effect of epidural analgesia and PCA on pain relief, pulmonary function, cathechol release, and immune response in patients sustaining significant thoracic trauma.; Patients (ages 18 to 60 years) sustaining thoracic injury were prospectively randomized to receive epidural analgesia or PCA during an 18-month period. Levels of serum interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured every 12 hours for 3 days by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Urinary catecholamine levels were measured every 24 hours. Independent observers assessed pulmonary function using standard techniques and analgesia using a verbal rating score.; Twenty-four patients of the 34 enrolled completed the study. Age, injury severity score, thoracic abbreviated injury score, and length of hospital stay did not differ between the two groups. There was no significant difference in plasma levels of IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, or TNF-alpha or urinary catecholamines between the two groups at any time point. Epidural analgesia was associated with significantly reduced plasma levels of IL-8 at days 2 and 3, verbal rating score of pain on days 1 and 3, and maximal inspiratory force and tidal volume on day 3 versus PCA.; Epidural analgesia significantly reduced pain with chest wall excursion compared with PCA. The route of analgesia did not affect the catecholamine response. However, serum levels of IL-8, a proinflammatory chemoattractant that has been implicated in acute lung injury, were significantly reduced in patients receiving epidural analgesia on days 2 and 3. This may have important clinical implications because lower levels of IL-8 may reduce infectious or inflammatory complications in the trauma patient. Also, tidal volume and maximal inspiratory force were improved with epidural analgesia by day 3. These results demonstrate that epidural analgesia is superior to PCA in providing analgesia, improving pulmonary function, and modifying the immune response in patients with severe chest injury.",E,E

Data were derived from 3 double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose trials enrolling subjects who met the International Headache Society's diagnostic criteria for migraine with or without aura. Subjects with incapacitating disability (attacks requiring bed rest >50% of the time) and those who usually experienced vomiting > or =20% of the time were excluded. Retrospective analysis of the 1220 subjects included in the efficacy-evaluable data set indicated that 185 women treated menstruation-associated migraine, 781 women treated migraine not associated with menses, and 1 woman provided no information regarding menstrual status. At baseline and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours postdose, subjects assessed the intensity of headache pain, functional disability, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. Pain intensity, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 = none to 3 = severe; functional disability was rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 = none to 4 = incapacitating. For both menstruation-associated migraine and migraine not associated with menses, the proportion of subjects with pain intensity reduced to mild or none (responders) was significantly greater with AAC than with placebo at all postdose time points from 0.5 through 6 hours (P< or =0.05), with no statistically significant difference in treatment effect between menstruation-associated migraine and migraine not associated with menses at any postdose time point. Migraine characteristics such as photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability were significantly improved in AAC-treated subjects at all time points from 1 through 6 hours (P< or =0.01) in both the menstruating and nonmenstruating groups. Significant relief from nausea was experienced in both menstruation-associated migraine and migraine not associated with menses, but relief appeared earlier in the AAC nonmenstruating subjects (2 hours postdose, P< or =0.01) than in the menstruating subjects (6 hours postdose, P< or =0.05). Beginning at 3 hours postdose, significantly fewer subjects treated with AAC required rescue medication (P< or =0.05) for menstruation-associated migraine (AAC 6%, placebo 15%) and migraine not associated with menses (AAC 7%, placebo 14%). The most commonly used rescue medications in both the menstruating and nonmenstruating groups were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, prescription combination analgesics/narcotics, and prescription migraine preparations. AAC was well tolerated in both menstruation-associated migraine and migraine not associated with menses; in general, adverse experiences were similar in both groups. The proportion of subjects who had 1 or more adverse experiences was significantly higher among those receiving AAC than among those receiving placebo (menstruation-associated migraine: AAC 26.4%, placebo 12.6%, P = 0.025; nonmenstruation-associated migraine: AAC 18.6%, placebo 11.4%, P = 0.005). Adverse experiences were similar in type and severity to those previously associated with single doses of acetaminophen, aspirin, or caffeine.

All patients received local anesthetic blocks and analgesic drugs during the perioperative period. There were no significant differences between the three groups in the pain scores and medication requirements during the period of study. It was concluded that preoperative use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates may not offer a preemptive analgesic effect in patients who have had adequate analgesia during the surgery. Continued use of analgesic drugs during the postoperative period is perhaps more useful for this purpose. There appears to be a higher incidence of vomiting following opiates (methadone), precluding its clinical use in day-care patients.",E,E

However, it is possible that for chest pain, the rates are higher in younger women and older men. Neck pain, joint pain, and fibromyalgia all appear to increase with age in both genders, whereas abdominal pain and tension-type headaches decrease with age, and migraine headache and TMD appear to peak in the reproductive years. A concluding example illustrates how epidemiologic data can be used to enhance our understanding of the causes of pain. A higher prevalence in women and a peak prevalence during the reproductive years as seen in TMD suggest that either biologic or psychosocial factors unique to women in this period of life could increase the risk of developing or maintaining this pain. As female reproductive hormones can play a role in migraine, at least for some women, it would be interesting to examine whether hormones play a role in TMD. The situation that occurs when menopause is followed by hormone replacement therapy (HRT) provides a natural experiment similar to a laboratory experiment in which female animals are deprived of the natural sources of hormones and then hormones are replaced exogenously. In women, of course, the decision to receive HRT may be associated with a number of psychosocial variables that might also influence pain. Recognizing these limitations, data from records of a large health maintenance organization were examined to ascertain whether use of estrogen or progestin (or both) in postmenopausal women might be associated with the occurrence of TMD pain and, thus, whether the hormone hypothesis might be worthy of further investigation. More women with TMD than controls used estrogen replacement therapy, and slightly more patients than controls used progestin. The use of estrogen significantly increased the odds of having TMD. Progestin use showed a weaker association, which did not hold up after other factors were controlled. However, the risk of TMD appears to increase with increasing doses of estrogen. A review of the epidemiologic literature indicates that there are definite age and sex differences in the prevalence of many chronic pain conditions. There is little basic information about the source of these differences, such as different onset rates, different probabilities of recurrence, or different durations of pain, or combinations of these in women and men. Nevertheless, a systematic examination of the existing epidemiologic data may be an important step in helping pain researchers to generate hypotheses in the search for a better understanding of chronic pain in both sexes.",E,E

If inadequately controlled, pain can have a profoundly adverse impact on the patient and his or her family. The critical importance of pain management as part of routine cancer care has been forcefully advanced by WHO, international and national professional organisations, and governmental agencies. The prevalence of chronic pain is about 30-50% among patients with cancer who are undergoing active treatment for a solid tumour and 70-90% among those with advanced disease. Prospective surveys indicate that as many as 90% of patients could attain adequate relief with simple drug therapies, but this success rate is not achieved in routine practice. Inadequate management of pain is the result of various issues that include: undertreatment by clinicians with insufficient knowledge of pain assessment and therapy; inappropriate concerns about opioid side-effects and addiction; a tendency to give lower priority to symptom control than to disease management; patients under-reporting of pain and non-compliance with therapy; and impediments to optimum analgesic therapy in the healthcare system. To improve the management of cancer pain, every practitioner involved in the care of these patients must ensure that his or her medical information is current and that patients receive appropriate education.",E,E

This controversy seems related to the use of multiple definitions of neuropathic pain together with its distinct mechanisms in both experimental animal models and human neuropathic pain syndromes, methodological shortcomings in available randomized controlled clinical trials, different methods of pain assessment, the inappropriate use of terms like efficacy and responsiveness, differential responses in spontaneous versus evoked pains, interindividual differences to specific opioids and opioid doses, and duration of follow-up. New randomized controlled clinical trials with opioids in neuropathic pain are still needed. These studies should include larger patient samples with rigorously defined homogeneous neuropathic pain syndromes. Active placebo's mimicking side-effects should be included in the double-blind design, and control of unmasking should be performed. Individual titration of the opioid dose and active management of side-effects in long-term follow-up studies need to measure both pain relief and quality of life.",3,E

In addition, the frequency of physician-imposed immobilization of the CRPS limb was assessed, as was physical examination evidence of myofascial dysfunction. This study found that these patients had seen on average 4.8 different physicians before referral to the pain center and had received an average of five different kinds of treatments both prior to and during pain clinic treatment. The mean duration of CRPS symptoms prior to pain center evaluation was 30 months. Seventeen percent had a lawsuit and 54% had a worker compensation claim related to the CRPS. Fifty-one patients received a bone scan, but only 53% of which were interpreted as consistent with the diagnosis of RSD/CRPS. Forty-seven percent had a history of physician-imposed immobilization, and 56% had a myofascial component present at evaluation. The duration of CRPS symptoms and the involvement of the upper extremity was significantly associated with the presence of myofascial dysfunction. Thus, this study found that most CRPS patients are referred to a pain specialty clinic after several years of symptoms and many failed therapies. The data also suggest the lack of utility of a diagnostic bone scan and highlight the prominence of myofascial dysfunction in a majority of CRPS patients.",E,E

The present study evaluated whether individual patients could detect differences or express preferences for individual opioids when treated by PCA with all three in random sequence finishing with the first administered opioid. The main side effects were pruritus, nausea and vomiting. There were few differences in patients' responses to morphine, pethidine and fentanyl, or of satisfaction with these drugs, across patients, but individual patients' responses to the opioids could be highly variable. Some patients were able to tolerate all three opioids investigated, some were intolerant to all and some patients appeared to be sensitive to one or two of the opioids but show a preference for the remainder. These findings support the clinical practice of changing from one opioid to another (with good effect) in post-operative patients experiencing intolerable side-effects. The reasons for a patient responding differently to different opioids and even to the same opioid on separate occasions are not clear and appear inexplicable on the grounds of currently postulated receptor affinities or of physicochemical properties of the opioids studied. A plethora of factors will influence how an individual patient will respond to surgery and how he/she will recover. The physiological response to opioids is one variable which appears to be influenced by this complex set of factors and in turn will affect them. The findings of this study, like that of its predecessor, suggest that morphine, pethidine and fentanyl can be used successfully in PCA and that for some patients who are responding poorly, changing the opioid may be beneficial.",E,E

The use of spinal opioids is widespread and increasing. The technique is used widely to treat intraoperative, postoperative, traumatic, obstetric, chronic, and cancer pain. Newer developments include the increasing use of combined local anesthetics and opioids or nonopioids and also PCEA, particularly in the obstetric population. Meta-analysis of controlled trials has demonstrated improved pulmonary outcome in patients receiving epidural postoperative analgesia. Although rare, respiratory depression continues to be a major problem of the technique. None of the currently available opioids is completely safe; however, extensive international experience has shown that patients receiving spinal opioids for postoperative analgesia can be safely nursed on regular wards, provided that trained personnel and appropriate guidelines are available. The importance of a good acute pain service to provide the safe and effective use of spinal opioids cannot be overemphasized.",E,E

In this cross-sectional survey of inpatients with cancer, patients responded to a structured interview (the Breakthrough Pain Questionnaire) designed to characterize breakthrough pain, and also completed measures of pain and mood (Memorial Pain Assessment Card (MPAC)), pain-related interference in function (Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)), depressed mood (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)), and anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)). Of 178 eligible patients, 164 (92.2%) met the criteria for controlled background pain. The median age was 50.6 years (range 26 to 77 years), 52% were men, and 80.6% were Caucasian. Tumor diagnoses were mixed, 75% had metastatic disease, 65% had pain caused directly by the neoplasm, and a majority had mixed nociceptive-neuropathic pain. The median Karnofsky Performance Status score was 60 (range 40 to 90). Eighty-four (51.2%) patients had experienced breakthrough pain during the previous day. The median number of episodes was six (range 1 to 60) and the median interval from onset to peak was 3 min (range 1 s to 30 min). Although almost two-thirds (61.7%) could identify precipitants (movement 20.4%; end-of-dose failure 13.2%), pain was unpredictable in a large majority (78.2%). Patients with breakthrough pain had more intense (P < 0.001) and more frequent (P < 0.01) background pain than patients without breakthrough pain. Breakthrough pain was also associated with greater pain-related functional impairment (difference in mean BPI. P < 0.001), worse mood (mood VAS, P < 0.05; BDI, P < 0.001), and more anxiety (BAI, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that breakthrough pain independently contributed to impaired functioning and psychological distress. These data confirm that cancer-related breakthrough pain is a prevalent and heterogeneous phenomenon. The presence of breakthrough pain is a marker of a generally more severe pain syndrome, and is associated with both pain-related functional impairment and psychological distress. The findings suggest the need for further studies of breakthrough pain and more effective therapeutic strategies.",E,E

This type of pain causes much suffering and disability and is frequently mistreated or undertreated. Patients who present for evaluation for chronic pain should undergo a careful assessment before therapy. Patients with chronic pain commonly experience depression, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and decreased overall physical and mental functioning. They frequently require an interdisciplinary model of care to allow care givers to address the multiple components of the patient's pain experience. After a careful evaluation, therapy may include medication, nerve blocks, active physical therapy, behavioural interventions, and assistance with vocational evaluation and training. Less frequently therapy may include placement of implantable devices to alter the pain experience. These patients suffer from a chronic condition and often require long-term care, with frequent reassessment and adjustment of therapy. Although cure is possible, it is also infrequent. Therefore, therapy is provided with the aim of decreasing pain and suffering while improving physical and mental functioning.",3,E

This study was designed to evaluate the role of oral ketamine or transdermal nitroglycerin polymer, a nitric oxide donor, as coadjuvants to oral morphine in cancer pain therapy.; After institutional approval and informed patient consent were obtained, 60 patients with cancer pain were randomized to one of four groups (n = 15) and studied prospectively to evaluate analgesia and any adverse effects. A visual analog scale that consisted of a 10-cm line with 0 representing ""no pain at all"" and 10 representing ""the worst possible pain"" was introduced. All patients were regularly taking oral amitriptyline 50 mg at bedtime. The morphine regimen was adjusted individually to a maximal oral dose of 80-90 mg/day to keep the visual analog scale score less than 4. When patients reported pain (visual analog scale of 4 or more), despite taking 80-90 mg oral morphine daily, the test drug was added as follows: the control group (CG) received an additional 20 mg oral morphine (10 mg at 12-h intervals); the nitroglycerin group (NG) received a 5-mg nitroglycerin patch daily; the ketamine group (KG) received 0.5 mg/kg oral ketamine at 12-h intervals; and the dipyrone group (DG) received 500 mg oral dipyrone at 6-h intervals. Patients were free to manipulate their daily morphine consumption when the test drug was introduced to keep their visual analog scale score less than 4.; The groups were similar with respect to demographic data and visual analog scale pain scores before treatment. The visual analog scale scores after the test drug was introduced were similar among the groups. The daily consumption of oral morphine was as follows: on day 15: CG = DG = NG (P > 0.05), CG > KG (P = 0.036); on day 20: CG > NG = KG (P < 0.02) (CG > KG, P < 0.005; CG > NG, P < 0.02), DG > KG (P < 0.05); on day 30: CG = DG > KG = NG (P < 0.05). Patients in the CG and DG groups reported somnolence, but patients in the NG and KG groups did not.; Low-dose ketamine and transdermal nitroglycerin were effective coadjuvant analgesics.

The optimal dose to use for major spinal surgery is not known.; Sixty patients undergoing posterolateral lumbar fusion with or without decompression were divided randomly into 3 groups of 20 patients each. Anesthesia, monitoring, and surgery were similar for all patients. Just before closing of the wound, morphine sulfate was injected into the dural sack under direct visualization. Patients in groups 1-3 received 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg, and 0.4 mg morphine, respectively. Routine analgesia, consisting of diclofenac, was prescribed to use if necessary. Measurements were made and compared between the groups at zero hours (on admission to the Intensive Care Unit), 6 hours, 12 hours, 18 hours, and 24 hours after surgery.; At zero hours and at 12 hours after surgery, pain levels were similar in groups 2 and 3, but were significantly higher in group 1 (P < 0.05). The respiratory rate was significantly lower in group 3 than in the other two groups (P < 0.05), and the arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) was consistently higher in group 3. PaCO2 decreased in all three groups over the first 24 hours.

We analyzed the effectiveness of a method for postoperative pain control in orbital implant surgery using an orbital epidural pain catheter connected to a patient-controlled analgesia bupivacaine hydrochloride pump.; One hundred nineteen patients undergoing orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery received placement of an orbital epidural catheter for the infusion of local anesthetics at the conclusion of their surgery. Patients were asked to gauge their level of comfort into the following 3 categories: total, some, or no pain relief in the first week after surgery. A separate numerical grading scale was used to further quantitate pain. Blood samples were collected in 4 patients to assess the systemic levels of bupivacaine.; Most patients (88.2%) responded with total or some pain relief, with only 11.8% suffering severe pain. The mean numerical pain score was 2.8, within a range of 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain). The average plasma bupivacaine level in the 4 patients in whom this was measured was 0.38 microg/mL, which is well below the toxic level of 4.0 microg/mL. Furthermore, there were only 5 minor complications caused by the catheters, ie, 1 retrobulbar hemorrhage and 4 catheters that did not work. No permanent problems arose from any of the complications.; The orbital epidural pain catheter is an effective means to achieve postoperative pain control after orbital implant surgery.

Quantitative somatosensory testing for tactile and thermal thresholds, qualitative pinprick testing, and testing of dynamic and static allodynia were performed within the affected dermatome, its mirror-image dermatome, and in an adjacent dermatome bilaterally.; Acute pain was reported as severe in 50%, moderate in 29%, mild in 12%, and absent in 9% of patients. Preherpetic pain (median = 4 days, range = 1-60 days) was experienced by 71%. Mechanical allodynia, dynamic, static, or both, was found in 37% of patients and was noted to extend one or more dermatomes outside the rash in 12%. In the affected dermatomes, thresholds were elevated for warmth and cold, lowered for heat pain, and unchanged for touch when compared with the contralateral side. Logistic regression analyses showed that compression-evoked allodynia, brush-evoked allodynia, and the history of preherpetic pain were more frequently encountered in patients with severe pain. Sensory threshold changes were not associated with the severity of pain or rash or with the presence of allodynia.; Pain, allodynia, and altered sensation are common features of acute herpes zoster. They are likely to result primarily from widespread neural inflammation within the affected afferent system. The sensory changes found in acute herpes zoster are different from those reported in published studies on postherpetic neuralgia and suggest sensitization phenomena and preservation of tactile functions rather than major neural damage. The exact mechanisms for acute herpes zoster pain, however, remain speculative.",E,E

A conceptual framework based on multidimensional outcomes is proposed using both disease-specific and generic measures.; Pre-post longitudinal data were collected in a retrospective fashion on 38 patients receiving intraspinal opioid therapy for a minimum of 36 months (average = 50 months).; Disease-specific measures included magnitude of infused opioid, side effects/complications, pain ratings, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and patient estimated improvement in pain (0-100%). Generic measures of health included the Quality of Well-Being Scale, Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short Form 36 (SF-36), return to work, patient estimated improvement in functioning, overall patient satisfaction, and family opinion of patient improvement.; Disease-specific outcomes. Patients receiving long-term intrathecal opioid administration showed a sixfold increase in morphine equivalents infusion rates across time. DAS patients showed a small but significant decrease in pain ratings from pre-treatment levels. Following 3 years or more of intrathecal opioid infusion, patients endorsed high pain levels on the McGill Pain Questionnaire, severe levels of disability via the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, mild levels of depression based on the Beck Depression Inventory, and multiple side effects associated with the intrathecal opioids and complications related to the infusion system. On retrospective questioning, patients receiving long-term intrathecal opioid administration reported an average of 64% improvement in their pain and 48% improvement in functioning. Family members of patients reported that they observed on average a 61% improvement in patient's pain. Generic outcome measures. On the Quality of Well-Being Scale, patients reported significantly lower health-related quality of life than health maintenance organization enrollees with no known chronic condition and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (p < 0.001). On the MOS SF-36, patients reported significantly lower physical functioning than the U.S. general population, patients with uncomplicated medical conditions, diabetes-type II patients, and congestive heart failure patients. Mental functioning was comparable to the U.S. general population (p > 0.001). Fourteen percent of patients were working following implantation. Eighty-nine percent of patients reported good to excellent satisfaction with the long-term intrathecal opioid therapy.; Results from this study revealed differences in findings across the outcome measures, highlighting the complexity of intrathecal opioid therapy. Generally, patients after 3 years or more of intrathecal opioid therapy can be characterized as hav ing substantially impaired physical functioning with a high prevalence of side effects. Despite poor physical functioning, patients endorsed relatively good mental health status with only mild depressive symptoms. Longitudinal pain ratings showed a modest decrease from pretreatment levels. On retrospective evaluation, patients and their family endorsed high levels of pain relief secondary to intrathecal therapy. Overall, findings support that intrathecal opioid therapy provides some therapeutic benefit although substantial physical impairment continues to cause debilitation in the patient population.",E,E

The aim of this study was to describe the patterns of prescription and administration of analgesic drugs used for postoperative pain after abdominal surgery in Spanish hospitals, to know the prevalence and the severity of postoperative pain, and to determine the extent of variability in the management of postoperative pain among the participating centres.; The study was a multicentre descriptive cross-sectional drug utilization study in 12 Spanish hospitals. The subjects were an unselected sample of consecutive patients undergoing abdominal surgery, admitted between October 1994 and January 1995. For each patient, information about the surgical procedure and the use of analgesics was prospectively collected. The severity of postoperative pain was assessed during the first day after surgery by means of a six-category (none, mild, moderate, severe, very severe, and unbearable) rating scale and a visual analogue scale (VAS).; Nine hundred and ninety-three patients (547 men) were included. The most common surgical procedures were inguinal hernia repair (315, 32%), cholecystectomy (268, 27%), appendectomy (140, 14%), bowel resection (137, 14%), and gastric surgery (58, 6%). Fifty-nine percent of patients (587) received nonopioid analgesics only, 9% (89) received opioid analgesics only, and 27% (263) received both opioid and nonopioid analgesics. The most frequently administered drugs were metamizole (667 patients) and pethidine (213 patients). Although in the majority of medical orders the administration of analgesics was scheduled at regular time intervals, the majority of actual doses were given 'as-needed'. The average administered daily doses of all analgesics were lower than those prescribed. Thirty-eight percent (371/967) of patients rated their maximum pain on the first day as severe to unbearable. Wide interhospital variability was recorded in the surgical procedures which had been performed, in the analgesics used, and also in the pain scores referred by patients. The percentage of patients in each centre who suffered severe to unbearable pain varied from 22 to 67%.; In Spain many patients still suffer severe pain after abdominal surgery, and this seems to be due to an inadequate use of analgesics. Wide interhospital variability in the management of postoperative pain and in its prevalence was also recorded.",E,E

Mr. Simmons and his family interact with professionals from various disciplines during this year. Advance care planning is completed and activated. Practical suggestions are offered for assessment and treatment of all aspects of his pain, including its physical, psychological, social, and spiritual dimensions. The methods of pain relief used or discussed include nonpharmacologic techniques, nonopioid analgesics, opioids, adjuvant medications, radiation therapy, and radiopharmaceutical agents. Overcoming resistance to taking opioids; initiating, titrating, and changing opioid routes and agents; and preventing or relieving the side effects they induce are also covered. Data on assessment and treatment of spinal cord compression are reviewed. Physicians can use the techniques described to more readily implement existing guidelines and provide comfort and optimize quality of life for patients with advanced cancer.",E,E
10393001,Opioids in pain management.,Chronic Disease; Drug Tolerance; Humans; Narcotics; Pain,"McQuay, H","Opioids are our most powerful analgesics, but politics, prejudice, and our continuing ignorance still impede optimum prescribing. Just over 100 years ago, opium poppies were still grown on the Cambridgeshire fens in the UK to provide oblivion for the working man and his family, but the brewing lobby argued on thin evidence that their potions were less dangerous. The restriction of opioid availability to protect society and the individual continues in many countries. In this review I focus on chronic and cancer pain, but many of the principles apply in acute pain. The justification for this focus is that patients with chronic pain may suffer longer and unnecessarily if we prescribe and legislate badly.",E,E

Patients were given intramuscular doses of either 60 mg of ketorolac plus 50 mg of chlorpromazine (75 mg of chlorpromazine for patients weighing more than 100 kg), or 50 mg of meperidine plus 25 mg of promethazine (50 mg of promethazine for patients weighing more than 75 kg); patients weighing more than 100 kg were given 1.5 doses. Patients older than 65 years or whose blood pressure at the time of injection was less than 110/70 mmHg were given half-doses. Patients could receive one additional half-dose injection if they had no results within 30 to 60 minutes after the first injection. Patients were assessed on self-report and on a verbal and visual analog scale of pain rating. Temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respirations were monitored every 15 minutes.; Both regimens performed well, with more than 90 percent of patients reporting good or excellent improvement on acute exacerbations of chronic pain. Ketorolac-chlorpromazine offered significant advantages compared with meperidine-promethazine when patients rated their pain on a visual analog pain scale (P < 0.05) but not on a verbal scale. Adverse reactions were minimal and consisted of more respiratory tract depression with meperidine and more vertigo or dizziness with chlorpromazine. There was no difference in incidence of hypotension between the two groups.; The combination of ketorolac and chlorpromazine is a safe and efficacious alternative to meperidine plus promethazine for the treatment of exacerbations of chronic pain in the rural emergency department setting.",E,E

Postoperative analgesia was provided by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA).; The fentanyl requirements were recorded for the 24-hour postoperative period and the total perioperative period. Postoperative pain was assessed by visual analog scale for pain (VASP). Plasma oxycodone concentrations were measured in groups OIB and OIM. The total perioperative fentanyl consumption was significantly lower in groups BIB (0.97 +/- 0.09 mg) and OIB (1.23 +/- 0.12 mg) than in group OIM (1.61 +/- 0.12 mg) (p = 0.01 and 0.048, respectively). Groups BIB and OIB were similar (p = 0.34). The absorption of oxycodone was significantly lower after subacromial than after intramuscular administration.; Intrabursal oxycodone and intrabursal bupivacaine reduced perioperative analgesic requirements similarly. Intrabursal oxycodone may offer an effective, simple, and safe method for postoperative analgesia after shoulder surgery.",E,E

The mean/maximal daily doses of the IT bupivacaine were 39/66, 55/80 and 69/125 mg, respectively. The pain intensity decreased from VASmean =7+/-1 to VASmean =2+/-2. None of the patients had regression of allodynia, edema, and trophic disturbances in the affected extremities. In 2 patients, the IT treatment did not prevent spread of the disease to the opposite extremity or the occurrence of phantom pain and stump allodynia after amputation. The IT catheters were withdrawn as being no longer needed: in 2 patients 56 and 458 days after amputation of the involved extremity, and in another one before replacement of the IT bupivacaine infusion with epidural dorsal column stimulation (EDCS). After termination of the IT treatment, the patients were observed for 1437, 1575, and 2689 days (until September 1, 1998). At that date, all the patients were alive, and still affected by their CRPS-I, either in the amputation stump (n=2), and/or in the opposite or remote extremities (n=2); further, two were unemployed and one worked for 75% of the time. One of them was taking up to 1500 mg of slow-release morphine to cope with pain.; The IT pain treatment with bupivacaine (with or without buprenorphine) alleviated the ""refractory"" pain, but affected neither the associated symptoms and signs of the CRPS-I, nor its natural evolution. Thus, the IT treatment cannot be recommended in preference to other pain treatment regimens for CRPS-I.",E,E

Several factors--medical, intellectual, emotional and logistic--influence the decision whether or not to prescribe, and the decision itself influences how the physicians feel about themselves. In this study the 'critical incident technique' was used for exploring the qualities of dilemmas among general physicians prior to prescribing analgesics to patients in primary health care. The study displayed two main types of problems in connection with prescription of opioids. The first main problem was a concern about abuse and addiction with no proper indication for the drug. The second main type of problem was related to the appropriateness of the drug, although the indication as such might be correct, i.e. acute or chronic pain. An important consequence of the dilemmas experienced influenced the physicians' self-esteem negatively, including failures in the patient-physician relationship. This results in emotional strain and is often experienced as a personal defeat. Only a few physicians denied prescription despite the experience of a dilemma, which might indicate an ambivalence or lack of knowledge among physicians with regard to proper indications for opioid prescription. However, it may also suggest that physicians need more training in saying no, or skills in deciding proper indications for opioids, which needs to be addressed during educational programmes.",E,E

The authors tested the hypothesis that postoperative analgesic techniques influence surgical outcome and the duration of convalescence.; Before standardized general anesthesia, 56 adult scheduled for major knee surgery were randomly assigned to one of three groups, each to receive a different postoperative analgesic technique for 72 h: continuous epidural infusion, continuous femoral block, or intravenous patient-controlled morphine (dose, 1 mg; lockout interval, 7 min; maximum dose, 30 mg/4 h). The first two techniques were performed using a solution of 1% lidocaine, 0.03 mg/ml morphine, and 2 microg/ml clonidine administered at 0.1 ml x kg(-1) x h(-1). Pain was assessed at rest and during continuous passive motion using a visual analog scale. The early postoperative maximal amplitude of knee flexion was measured during continuous passive motion at 24 h and 48 h and compared with the target levels prescribed by the surgeon. To evaluate functional outcome, the maximal amplitudes were measured again on postoperative day 5, at hospital discharge (day 7), and at 1- and 3-month follow-up examinations. When the patients left the surgical ward, they were admitted to a rehabilitation center, where their length of stay depended on prospectively determined discharge criteria; The continuous epidural infusion and continuous femoral block groups showed significantly lower visual analog scale scores at rest and during continuous passive motion compared with the patient-controlled morphine group. The early postoperative knee mobilization levels in both continuous epidural infusion and continuous femoral block groups were significantly closer to the target levels prescribed by the surgeon than in the patient-controlled morphine group. On postoperative day 7, these values were 90 degrees (60-100 degrees)(median and 25th-75th percentiles) in the continuous epidural infusion group, 90 degrees (60-100 degrees) in the continuous femoral block group, and 80 degrees (60-100 degrees) in the patient-controlled morphine group (P < 0.05). The durations of stay in the rehabilitation center were significantly shorter: 37 days (range, 30-45 days) in the continuous epidural infusion group, 40 days (range, 31-60 days) in the continuous femoral block group, and 50 days (range, 30-80 days) in the patient-controlled morphine group (P < 0.05). Side effects were encountered more frequently in the continuous epidural infusion group.; Regional analgesic techniques improve early rehabilitation after major knee surgery by effectively controlling pain during continuous passive motion, thereby hastening convalescence.",E,E

Although measures of pain intensity and pain relief show a good overall correlation, it is not known if they relate to each other consistently over time Such consistency is necessary if both measures are used to depict analgesic drug action versus time. This study examined in chronic pain patients if the relationship between visual analog pain intensity and pain relief scores was consistent during two analgesic drug studies.; Data from two independently performed analgesic drug studies were analyzed using linear regression. Data were split into pain intensity and pain relief scores recorded before and after patients' experience of maximum analgesia (>90% of maximum pain relief). The slopes of the linear regression line depicting pain intensity versus pain relief scores before and after maximum analgesia were statistically compared.; The slope of the linear regression line before and after maximum analgesia was significantly different in both drug studies (nonoverlapping 95% confidence intervals), -2.16+/-0.57 versus -1.05+/-0.10 and -1.47+/-0.26 versus -1.09+/-0.07, respectively. These results are compatible with the observation that patients indicating the same pain intensity before and after maximum analgesia reported a different magnitude of pain relief.; The relationship between visual analog pain intensity and pain relief scores changed systematically during both analgesic drug studies. The authors hypothesize that patients' interpretation of the pain relief scale had changed during the studies and therefore suggest using the pain intensity scale to quantify analgesic drug action over time.",3,E

Patients in the ICB and IPA groups had access to pain relief by PCA with piritramide as well. Additional medication for all groups if the analgesia was insufficient consisted of metamizol. There were no significant differences in piritramide consumption between the two regional analgesia groups and the control group up to the 3rd and 7th postoperative day. Up to the 7th day piritramide consumption in group ICB was 78 mg, in group IPA 75 mg and 80 mg in the control group. Patients in group ICB showed significantly less pain at rest measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) on the 1st postoperative day (U-test, P < 0.05), but otherwise there were no statistical differences regarding pain scores. Respiratory parameters such as forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, peak flow and the Tiffeneau test (FVC, FEV1, PF, FEV1/FVC) were reduced significantly after thoracoscopy and showed a slow recovery in all three groups without significant intergroup differences. Thoracoscopic surgery causes less and shorter lasting pain in comparison to thoracotomy. Nevertheless, effective pain management is necessary. We could not demonstrate a significant reduction in piritramide consumption for the techniques of regional analgesia tested here (ICB, IPA). We conclude that the use of these techniques is not complementary after thoracoscopy, since an opioid (PCA with piritramide) combined with a non-opioid (metamizol) resulted in satisfactory analgesia.",E,E

This work proposes to evaluate the intensity of pain, supply a scale of levels of intervention, with an indication of the consumption and relative costs of pharmacological therapies.; 37 out of 100 patients undergoing haemodialysis suffer chronic pain. Aetiological research has shown that osteoarticular pain (24 cases), is the most common, peripheral vascular pain (3 cases), is subjectively and indirectly considered to be the most serious form. Nine cases have presented pain of a neuromuscular origin, whilst one case of a neoplastic origin. The degree of personal invalidism shows serious invalidism in 11 cases.; The therapeutic file that forsaw four levels of pharmacological intervention (1st levels: FANS, 2nd level: Codeine+paracetamol, 3rd level: Buprenorphine, 4th level: Morphine for os), accompanied by instrumental and pharmacological support intervention, has proved to be indispensable in confronting the problem. Through pharmacy data, we have noticed a progressive increase over the year in the use of analgesic medicines, of which we can confirm the effectiveness, tolerability, low level of side-effects, at low costs.; In our opinion chronic pain in dialysed patients should not be neglected. The perfection of diagnostic techniques, the discovery of pain-killers with reduced side-effects, the multidisciplinary approach, and reduced costs of treatment, are all valid arguments in favour of an intervention that improves the quality of life of these patients, already so compromised by the nature of the illness itself.",E,E

However an efficient pain therapy is not possible without knowing the cause of pain. In most posttraumatic pain situations peripheral nociceptors are activated and normal afferences are conducted via an intact nociceptive system. In contrast, neuropathic pain pain is caused by lesions of the nervous system itself. Mechanisms of central sensibilization and involvement of the sympathetic nervous system may lead to chronification of such pain conditions. The therapeutic regime of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is demonstrated by algorithms of treatment modalities. Apart from classic non-opioid analgesics, co-analgesics and opioids have an important status in chronic pain management as well. Prescription of these substances has to follow strictly defined standards of pain therapy. Blockades with local anaesthetics as mono-therapy of chronic pain are obsolete. In posttraumatic pain, however, a certain number of adjuvant blockades or infiltrations of triggerpoints may be helpful. The exceptional place of sympathetic blockades are in diagnosis and therapy of sympathetic maintained pain (SMP).",E,E

Patients receiving a single dose of lornoxicam 16 mg experienced significantly greater total pain relief than patients receiving tramadol 100 mg over the following 8 hours. Lornoxicam had greater analgesic efficacy than tramadol in patients with moderate baseline pain but was of equivalent efficacy in those with severe/unbearable baseline pain. Fewer patients in the lornoxicam group required rescue medication (58% vs. 77%, respectively). Patients' global impression of efficacy showed lornoxicam to be superior to tramadol with 82% and 49% of patients, respectively, rating treatment as good, very good, or excellent. Following multiple-dose administration of lornoxicam (8 mg tid) or tramadol (100 mg tid) for 3 days, efficacy profiles similar to those following a single dose were obtained. Thus, slightly fewer patients in the lornoxicam group required rescue medication, and patients' global impression of efficacy again favored lornoxicam. Adverse events were reported by 38 of the 76 patients and were mainly mild to moderate in severity. Significantly fewer patients reported one or more adverse events with lornoxicam than with tramadol (14 vs. 24, respectively). Thus, intramuscular lornoxicam offers a useful alternative to tramadol for the treatment of moderate to severe postoperative pain.",E,E

In exocrine pancreatic cancer there are three main symptoms that must be dealt with: pain, loss of weight and jaundice. All of them seriously impair quality of life, but most often pain is the most feared by the patients. Despite this, the intensity and the quality of the pain is all too often only scantly described. In 85 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer we have prospectively registered the quality and quantity of their pain and correlated it to tumor and patient characteristics. It was found that about one fourth of the patients were totally pain free and half of all suffered a pain described by two or less on a Visual Analogue Scale. Only one in ten had severe pain. Although more and more patients were treated with morphine, it was still about one third of all patients that had no or only little pain in the last part of their life. Pain had a strong correlation to survival. This may be due to secondary effects like depressing the mood of the patient and reducing the food intake, but is probably more often a reflection of that generalized cancer induces more pain. Analgesic drugs are the cornerstone of the pharmacologic management of pain due to pancreatic cancer. A significant part of the patients do well with only paracetamol and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Combining these agents with narcotic analgesics can enhance pain control while lessening the dose of narcotics. A wide range of narcotics are available as well as different modes for delivery: regular pills, slow release forms, injections, subcutaneous injections, epidural etc. Each patient's pain management should be individualized, based on the intensity of pain, the type of pain and the side effects. It is essential not only to describe the medication, but also to follow-up the development of the pain and the patient's total experience of the situation. As an alternative to narcotics, plexus celiac blocks have been used with somewhat different result; in the hands of the experts the percutaneous approach is usually sufficient, but in the hands of other also poor results are reported. During the last years thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy has been tried as a complement giving long-standing pain relief with little or no side effects in the majority of patients. With this approach the sympathetic fibers lead by the symphathetic chain and further by the nervus splanchnicus major, minor and minors are divided. The denervation is easily done and can be performed bilateraly in one seance. This method will probably be used more often as the technique is now well described.",E,E

This study characterized regular codeine users (using at least 3 days per week for 6 months, excluding those using codeine for the treatment of cancer pain) through a self-completed questionnaire. Recruitment through newspaper advertisements resulted in a total of 339 eligible questionnaires. Thirty-seven percent of subjects met DSM-IV criteria for codeine dependence. Dependent subjects (mean age, 40 +/- 10 years) were using an average of 179 (+/-171) mg of codeine per day. Codeine was predominantly used in the form of combination products with acetaminophen. Dependent subjects identified specific problems causally related to their codeine use such as depression (23%), anxiety (21%), and gastrointestinal disturbances (13%). The dependent subjects reported problems with other drugs more than did nondependent users (alcohol, 57% vs. 26%; cannabis, 23% vs. 5%; sedative/hypnotics, 33% vs. 12%; and heroin, 11% vs. 2%, respectively). Most were taking codeine primarily for a chronic pain problem (81%), although the dependent subjects currently found codeine less effective for treating pain than did the nondependent subjects and were more likely to use codeine for pleasurable effects, to relax, or to prevent withdrawal symptoms. This study showed that dependence is associated with the regular use of codeine. Pain is a key issue with these users; however, they are probably not receiving optimal treatment. There is a need to identify individuals experiencing problems with their codeine use and to develop optimal prevention and treatment strategies.",E,E

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs have gained popularity in management of pediatric surgical patients to reduce the need for opioids. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of different doses of rectal acetaminophen in day-case surgery in children.; A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study design was used. Patients (n = 120) were randomized to receive a single dose of 0, 20, 40, or 60 mg/kg of rectal acetaminophen after induction of anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced by mask ventilation with sevoflurane (7%) in nitrous oxide and oxygen and maintained with 2.5-4.0% end-tidal sevoflurane. Opioids or local anesthetics were not used. Postoperative pain was evaluated by behavioral assessment and physiologic measurements every 10 min after arrival at the postanesthesia care unit. The pain intensity was scored using a 0-100 visual analog scale used in the authors' clinic. The need for rescue medication, intravenous morphine 0.1 mg/kg, was decided by the nurse, who was unaware of the rectal acetaminophen dose. The parents were interviewed by phone after 24 h regarding pain and its treatment, nausea, and vomiting. Rescue analgesia at home was rectal ibuprofen, 10 mg/kg.; In the postanesthesia care unit pain scores were significantly lower in the 40- and 60-mg/kg groups compared with placebo and 20-mg/kg groups. Acetaminophen resulted in a dose-related reduction in the number of children who required postoperative rescue opioid, with significance reached with 40 or 60 mg/kg doses. Calculated dose of acetaminophen at which 50% of the children not requiring a rescue opioid was 35 mg/kg. The need for rescue analgesia at home during the first 24 h after surgery was also significantly less in patients in the 40- or 60-mg/kg groups than in the 0- or 20-mg/kg groups (20-17 vs. 80-63%). Thirty-three percent of patients receiving placebo had postoperative nausea and vomiting, compared with 0-3% in groups receiving 40 or 60 mg/kg acetaminophen.; A single dose of 40 or 60 mg/kg of rectal acetaminophen has a clear morphine-sparing effect in day-case surgery in children if administered at the induction of anesthesia.

In an open randomized trial, rectal tramadol was compared with our standard treatment acetaminophen/codeine suppositories. We expected tramadol to be equally effective as our current standard but with fewer side effects. Forty patients were treated with either tramadol suppositories 100 mg 6 hourly (qds) or acetaminophen/codeine suppositories 1000/20 mg qds. Patients were comparable with regard to demographic data and type of surgery and anaesthesia. Post-operative pain was scored with the aid of a Visual Analogue Scale before each drug administration, at rest and during movement. Side effects, notably nausea and vomiting, were recorded by interviewing the patients and by inspecting the nursing report. There was no difference in pain scores between the two groups. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was significantly higher in the tramadol-treated (84%) than in the acetaminophen/codeine treated group (31%). The relative risk of experiencing an episode of nausea under treatment with tramadol was 2.7 (95% confidence interval: 1.3-5.3; P = 0.0001) as compared with acetaminophen/codeine. We conclude that for acute treatment of mild to moderate post-operative pain frequent nausea and vomiting makes tramadol suppositories less suitable than acetaminophen/codeine.",E,E

A number of guidelines have been developed to assist the clinician in optimizing comfort care. We implemented clinical guidelines for cancer pain management in the community setting and evaluated whether these guidelines improved care.; Eighty-one cancer patients, aged 37 to 76 years, were enrolled onto a prospective, longitudinal, randomized controlled study from the outpatient clinic settings of 26 western Washington-area medical oncologists. A multilevel treatment algorithm based on the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Guidelines for Cancer Pain Management was compared with standard-practice (control) pain and symptom management therapies used by community oncologists. The primary outcome of interest was pain (Brief Pain Inventory); secondary outcomes of interest were all other symptoms (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale) and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale).; Patients randomized to the pain algorithm group achieved a statistically significant reduction in usual pain intensity, measured as slope scores, when compared with standard community practice (P < .02). Concurrent chemotherapy and patient adherence to treatment were significant mediators of worst pain. There were no significant differences in other symptoms or quality of life between the two treatment groups.; This guideline implementation study supports the use of algorithmic decision making in the management of cancer pain. These findings suggest that comprehensive pain assessment and evidence-based analgesic decision-making processes do enhance usual pain outcomes.",E,E

A total of 2574 nonsurgical patients who presented with pain requiring treatment with an opioid analgesic agent participated in this trial. The most common presenting painful condition was back or neck pain, reported by approximately one third of patients. A total of 520 patients (317 females, 203 males) developed nausea or vomiting after opioid administration and were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of 1 of 3 study treatments: placebo (n = 94), ondansetron 8 mg (n = 215), or ondansetron 16 mg (n = 211). Ondansetron 8 and 16 mg led to complete control of emesis in 134 of 215 patients (62.3%) and 145 of 211 patients (68.7%), respectively. Results with both doses were significantly better than those seen with placebo (43 of 94 patients [45.7%]). Complete control of nausea was achieved in 6.8% of placebo patients, 14.8% of ondansetron 8-mg-treated patients, and 19.4% of ondansetron 16-mg treated patients; only ondansetron 16 mg was significantly better than placebo (P = 0.007). Significantly more patients who received ondansetron 8 mg than patients who received placebo were satisfied/very satisfied with their antiemetic treatment, as assessed by 4 patient-satisfaction questions. Significantly more patients who received ondansetron 16 mg compared with placebo were satisfied/very satisfied on 2 of 4 satisfaction questions. In conclusion, based on the observed incidence of opioid-induced nausea and vomiting in this study, it may be more appropriate to treat symptoms on occurrence rather than administering antiemetic agents prophylactically. The results of this study demonstrate that intravenous ondansetron in doses of 8 or 16 mg is an effective antiemetic agent for the control of opioid-induced nausea and vomiting in nonsurgical patients requiring opioid analgesia for pain.",E,E

However, many NMDA receptor antagonists also produce highly undesirable side effects at doses within their putative therapeutic range. This has unfortunately led to the conclusion that NMDA receptor antagonism is not a valid therapeutic approach. However, memantine is clearly an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist at therapeutic concentrations achieved in the treatment of dementia and is essentially devoid of such side effects at doses within the therapeutic range. This has been attributed to memantine's moderate potency and associated rapid, strongly voltage-dependent blocking kinetics. The aim of this review is to summarise preclinical data on memantine supporting its mechanism of action and promising profile in animal models of chronic neurodegenerative diseases. The ultimate purpose is to provide evidence that it is indeed possible to develop clinically well tolerated NMDA receptor antagonists, a fact reflected in the recent interest of several pharmaceutical companies in developing compounds with similar properties to memantine.",E,E

The role of the NMDA receptor in the processing of nociceptive input has led naturally to renewed clinical interest in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists such as ketamine. This paper reviews the use and efficacy of low-dose ketamine in the management of acute postoperative pain. The literature was obtained from a computer search of the MEDLINE database from 1966 through December 1998. Studies were included for review if they were randomized, prospective, controlled, double-blind and reported pain scores. We evaluate the clinical literature and discuss the efficacy of low-dose ketamine in the management of acute postoperative pain when administered alone or in conjunction with other agents via the oral, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous and intraspinal routes. Low-dose ketamine is defined as a bolus dose of less than 2 mg/g when given intramuscularly or less than 1 mg/kg when administered via the intravenous or epidural route. For continuous i.v. administration low-dose ketamine is defined as a rate of < or =20 microg/kg per min. We conclude that ketamine may provide clinicians with a tool to improve postoperative pain management and to reduce opioid related adverse effects. The evidence suggests that low-dose ketamine may play an important role in postoperative pain management when used as an adjunct to local anesthetics, opioids, or other analgesic agents. Further research is required in the following areas: (a) dose-finding studies for ketamine as an adjunct to opioids and local anesthetics (b) efficacy and optimal route of administration (c) the role of S(+)-ketamine; (d) the influence of ketamine on long-term outcome such as chronic pain (e) long-term physical and chemical stability of mixtures containing ketamine (f) spinal toxicity of ketamine and (g) effects of low-dose ketamine on cognitive and memory functioning after surgery.",E,E

In two groups of patients with chronic pain (n = 428 non-cancer (Study 1) and n = 143 cancer-related (Study 2)), men and women were compared on medications prescribed, treatment history, and coping and adaptation. In Study 1 with the non-cancer pain patients, there were no significant differences between the sexes in past treatments, current analgesic use, pain, or disability. Women were significantly more depressed and were more likely to receive antidepressants than men. Subgrouping patients on the basis of pain-adaptation responses yielded groups with distinct psychosocial and behavioral characteristics. In Study 2 with the cancer pain patients, men and women did not show significant differences on any variables. Consistent with the results of Study 1, however, psychological subgroups differed significantly in pain severity, mood and disability regardless of sex. The results of both studies suggest that the role of patients' sex in chronic pain may be less important than their psychosocial and behavioral responses. Thus, it appears that knowing the psychological characteristics of patients may be more important than their sex.",E,E

Opioid analgesics are the mainstay of treatment for moderate to severe pain. Chronic pain patients offer some difficult challenges for busy primary care physicians.

Nonetheless, in contrast to former opinion there is no type of pain that is principally resistant to opioids, which means that the individual patient's response to opioid administration has to be investigated to determine adequate treatment. Opioids fail most frequently in cases of neuropathic, osseous or sympathetically maintained pain. In these cases there is an indication for early use of co-analgesics. The analgesic potency of anticonvulsives and tricyclic antidepressants has been best documented. A differential indication of the large number of possible coanalgesics should be determined with the help of a detailed pain history focussing on the pain quality. Similar to the WHO analgesic ladder used in (tumor) pain therapy, co-analgesic therapy should only be supplemented by invasive therapeutic procedures after various combinations and alternative substances have proven fruitless. Experience shows that this is necessary only for a small number of patients.",E,E

We hypothesized that by increasing the dose beyond 25 micrograms, a prolonged duration of analgesia could be achieved. The purpose of the present study was to compare the difference in duration of effective analgesia and adverse effects produced by 25, 37.5, and 50 micrograms of ITF. A sample population of 60 term parturient women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies who were in active labor and requesting pain control were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: group 1, 25 micrograms (n = 20); group 2, 37.5 micrograms (n = 20); and group 3, 50 micrograms (n = 20). The ITF was then administered by an anesthesia provider blinded to the dose via a combined spinal epidural technique. The time from injection to the time of request for subsequent pain control (considered the duration of effective analgesia), maternal and fetal vital signs, and adverse effects were recorded at specific intervals until the patient requested activation of the epidural catheter or delivery occurred, ending participation in the study. Statistical analysis using a 1-way analysis of variance and considering a P value of < .05 to be significant revealed no difference in duration of effective analgesia between the groups. Statistical differences in the incidence of adverse effects, particularly uterine hyperstimulation, hypotension, pruritus, nausea, and fetal heart rate decelerations were not evident using the Fisher Irwin test and a significance of P < .05.

There have been few large surveys of cancer pain characteristics and syndromes, and comparative data from patients in different parts of the world are entirely lacking. To better define the characteristics of cancer pain syndromes the Task Force on Cancer Pain of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) conducted a prospective, cross-sectional, international, multicenter survey of pain specialists and their patients. From a total of 100 clinicians who described themselves as cancer pain practitioners in the IASP membership directory, 51 agreed to participate in the survey and a total of 58 provided data. These clinicians resided in 24 countries and evaluated a total of 1095 patients with severe cancer pain mostly requiring opioid medication, using a combination of patient-rated and observer-rated measures. The patient-rated scales comprised a pain intensity measure chosen from the brief pain inventory. The observer-rated information included demographic and tumor-related data, and responses on checklists of pain syndromes and pathophysiologies. Patients were heterogeneous in terms of demographics and tumor-related information. More than 76% had a Kamofsky performance status score < or = 70. Almost one-quarter of the patients experienced two or more pains. A large majority of the patients (92.5%) had one or more pains caused directly by the cancer; 20.8% of patients had one or more pains caused by cancer therapies. The average (SD) duration of pain was 5.9 (10.5) months. Approximately two-thirds of patients (66.7%) reported that the worst pain intensity during the day prior to the survey was > or = 7 on a 10-point numeric scale. The factors that were univariately associated with higher pain intensity included the presence of breakthrough pain, somatic pain or neuropathic pain, age younger than 60 years, and lower performance status score. A multivariate model suggested that the presence of breakthrough pain, somatic pain, and lower performance status were the most important predictors of intense pain. Pains that were inferred by the treating clinician to be nociceptive and due to somatic injury occurred in 71.6% of the patients. Pains labeled nociceptive visceral were noted in 34.7% and pains inferred to have neuropathic mechanisms occurred in 39.7%. In a broad classification, the major pain syndromes comprised bone or joint lesions (41.7% of patients), visceral lesions (28.1%), soft tissue infiltration (28.3%), and peripheral nerve injuries (27.8%). Twenty-two types of pain syndromes were most prevalent. Large differences in the diagnosis of breakthrough pain by clinicians of different countries suggest that this phenomenon is either defined or recognized differently across countries. These data confirm, in segment of the cancer population experiencing severe pain, in different parts of the world, that cancer pain characteristics, syndromes and pathophysiologies are very heterogeneous. Predictors of worsening pain can be identified. The data provide a useful context for the interpretation of pain-related information acquired in both clinical and research settings. They suggest the need for future studies and the potential usefulness of a written checklist for cancer pain syndromes and pathophysiologies.",E,E

Comparison of randomized and non-randomized inpatient and outpatient samples at baseline and in treatment outcomes up to one year was made to determine whether the findings of the RCT generalized to non-randomized patients in the same treatment program. One hundred and twenty one patients with intractable pain, randomized between inpatient, outpatient and waiting list control, were compared with 128 who elected for either inpatient or outpatient treatment. Treatment was a group-based multidisciplinary cognitive-behavioral treatment program aimed at enabling patients to return to more normal function despite persistent pain, delivered to mixed groups of randomized and elective patients, and outcome was measured by physical performance, pain impact on function, mood, and drug use. Agreement to randomization was a function of travelling distance from home to hospital. Non-randomized patients largely resembled their randomized counterparts before and after treatment. In order to indicate the clinical significance of results, analyses were conducted using numbers needed to treat (NNTs). NNTs estimate the number of patients required in the treatment condition for one of them to achieve the specified outcome who would not have achieved it in the comparison condition. Across a range of measures at one month follow-up, comparison of inpatients with outpatients gave NNTs between 2.3 and 7.5, and comparison of inpatients with waiting list controls gave NNTs between 2.3 and 3.6. At one year inpatients showed greater likelihood than outpatients of maintaining these treatment gains.",3,E

Tramadol is an analgesic drug acting directly on opioid receptors and indirectly on monoaminergic receptor systems. The aim of this trial was to determine whether tramadol relieved painful polyneuropathy and reduced allodynia. The study design was randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and cross-over. After baseline observations, 45 patients were assigned to one of the two treatment sequences. The dose of tramadol slow-release tablets was titrated to at least 200 mg/day and at highest 400 mg/day. During the two treatment periods of 4 weeks duration, patients rated pain, paraesthesia and touch-evoked pain by use of 0-10 point numeric rating scales. Mechanical allodynia induced by stimulation with an electronic toothbrush was rated at the end of each treatment period with a similar scale. Thirty-four patients completed the study. Their ratings for pain (median 4 vs. 6, P=0.001), paraesthesia (4 vs. 6, P=0.001) and touch-evoked pain (3 vs. 5, P<0.001) were lower on tramadol than on placebo, as were their ratings of allodynia (0 vs. 4, P=0.012). The number needed to treat to obtain one patient with >/=50% pain relief was 4.3 (95% confidence interval 2.4-20).

Methadone may be an excellent alternative in such patients due to its lack of known active metabolites, high lipid solubility, excellent absorption following oral and rectal delivery, and extremely low cost. However, it has unique problems, such as a long, unpredictable half-life and greater potency than previously assumed. At present, methadone is viewed as a second-line opioid for chronic cancer pain. Better pharmacokinetic and clinical studies are required to establish the role of methadone in this setting. Issues to be explored include a potential role in treating patients who have poorly responsive pain syndromes, such as neuropathic pain, or who develop a rapid tolerance to other opioids; the possibility of extending dosing intervals to every 12 or 24 hours; and its possible use as a first-line opioid.",3,E

Each method of pain management during ESWL was assessed using a standard 10-point linear pain scale and by the requirement for supplemental analgesia during treatment. Supplemental analgesia was administered intravenously using a patient-controlled analgesic pump. The results were compared between the three groups, as were such parameters as body habitus, stone burden, stone location, number of shock waves, and the presence of ureteral stents.; Pain severity averaged 4.6 points on the pain scale for the three groups combined. Pain tended to be more severe in group C (5.4) than in group A (4.3) or group B (4.1); however, the differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05). The amount of supplemental analgesia was similar in all three groups. Stone burden, stone location, and number of shock waves did not influence the severity of pain or analgesic requirement during ESWL. The analgesic requirement was significantly less in patients with ureteral stents (n = 32) than in patients without (n = 42), averaging 10 mg versus 24 mg MS, respectively (P = 0.01). KT was not associated with adverse events such as bleeding. MS was more likely to cause oversedation and nausea or vomiting, necessitating naloxone and antiemetic therapy, respectively.; The use of KT was safe and effective for premedication before ESWL; patients receiving KT before ESWL reported lower pain scores and required less supplemental analgesia requirement than those who received MS or Emla; however, the differences were not statistically significant.

Controlled clinical trials demonstrated that opioids may be effective in both nociceptive and neuropathic noncancer pain, although the former responded more consistently than the latter. Gastrointestinal and CNS adverse effects were frequent in most studies. Observational studies have generated contradictory findings regarding efficacy and safety as well as the risk of drug addiction in patients with chronic noncancer pain receiving long term opioid therapy. However, they suggest that opioids may be effective in individual cases, whichever the pathophysiological mechanism of pain. Taken together, the available data indicate that the outcomes associated with opioid therapy vary markedly across patients experiencing chronic nonmalignant pain. The main consensus is that a subset of these patients may gain substantial benefit from opioid analgesics without requiring rapidly escalating doses or developing intolerable adverse effects or drug addiction. Prescribing guidelines have been developed to assist practitioners in selecting the appropriate patients and ensuring an acceptable risk : benefit ratio of opioid therapy. Finally, it must be emphasised that chronic pain is a complex entity wherein analgesics, including opioids, are only part of the treatment.",3,E

This study was designed to investigate the effects of long-term opioid analgesia on attention and reaction time in cancer pain and in non-malignant pain.; Three groups of patients (n=128) were studied: 48 patients on long-term opioid therapy (group O; including 33 patients with cancer pain and 15 patients with chronic non-malignant pain), 30 patients receiving non-opioid analgesic therapy for chronic non-malignant pain (group NO) and a control group (group K) of 50 patients without pain and analgesic therapy. Attention was determined by Brickenkamp's d2-test, continuous reaction time by Schuhfried's method (Wiener Determinationsger盲t, M枚dling, Austria). In addition, a modified questionnaire developed by Zerssen was used to determine the patient's current mood. Pain, fatigue and anxiety levels were estimated by visual analogue scales.; Although no significant difference in attention/concentration could be demonstrated between the three groups, patients taking opioids performed Brickenkamp's test a little worse and also demonstrated a significant decline in this parameter with advancing age. Also, in cancer patients attention/ concentration was more impaired than in non-cancer opioid patients. Auditory and optical reaction times were significantly slower in patients on opioids than in the non-opioid analgesic group and highly significant slower than in the control group, while in the more complex combinations test no such difference could be demonstrated. In addition, a highly significant deterioration in reaction times with increasing age could be demonstrated for opioid patients compared to the other groups, while only a non significant prolongation was found between cancer and non-cancer patients on opioid therapy.; Long-term opioid therapy produces a slight (non significant) impairment of psychomotor performance in patients with cancer pain or non-malignant chronic pain. These effects become significantly more pronounced with increasing age and in patients with cancer pain, indicating a higher susceptibility of the elderly towards opioids. These results indicate that, particularly in older patients receiving long-term opioid for cancer oder non-cancer pain, careful evaluation of their effects on psychomotor function is necessary in order to estimate patient's ability to perform his daily activities. However, since opioid effects were only minimal in the non-elderly other factors like basic disease, opioid dose, physical condition and age seem to be of greater importance than the effects of opioids per se.",I,E

The setting was an urban, Level 1, trauma center. Patients enrolled presented to the emergency department (ED) with radiographically confirmed AASD and were randomized either to the IVAS group or the IAL group. Ease of reduction and pain associated with reduction were measured subjectively using a 10-point scale. There were 49 patients entered into the study, 20 in the IVAS group and 29 in the IAL group. There was no statistically significant difference between mean +/- SD pain scores of 3.32+/-2.39 in the IVAS group and 4.90+/-2.34 in the IAL group (P = .18), or mean +/- SD ease of reduction scores of 3.32+/-2.36 in the IVAS group and 4.45+/-2.46 in the IAL group (P = .12). Although IVAS tended to have a higher success rate (20 of 20) than IAL (25 of 29) in this study, Kaplan-Meier estimates for delayed time-events curves applying the log-rank test showed that this difference was not statistically significant overall (P = .16). However, with reduction rate evaluated as a function of time delay in seeking treatment, patients presenting 5.5 hours after dislocation were more likely to fail treatment with IAL (P = .00001). Additionally, half of the patients in the IAL group who had experience with IVAS did not favor IAL. Emergency physicians should be aware of IAL as an alternative technique that may be considered in patients when there are reasons to avoid systemic analgesia or sedation.",E,E

Butorphanol is an opiod with mixed agonist-antagonist properties, and is marketed as a nasal spray. Undiluted, it will cause significant physical withdrawal symptoms in a population dependent on opioids. Forty patients dependent on opioids were detoxified using dilute butorphanol spray. The initial concentration was 40% and gradually reduced. This technique was highly successful in keeping this difficult group of patients engaged in the treatment process for a longer period. This time increased the probability of getting these patients involved with postdetoxification services. There was a subset of patients who had chronic pain and were opioid dependent, who had adequate control of pain with butorphanol spray at 10 to 20% concentration. This unique and unusual approach is worthy of open discussion and further scientific studies.",E,E

In the current experiments, the first placebo controlled dose response study of opioid analgesic efficacy that examines for gender differences, nalbuphine (5, 10, or 20 mg) and placebo were evaluated in 62 men and 69 women for the treatment of moderate to severe postoperative pain following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. In a randomized, open injection, double blind experimental design, pain intensity was recorded on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) immediately prior to drug administration (baseline) and at 20 min intervals thereafter. Although responses to placebo were similar in men and women, for all doses of nalbuphine women exhibited significantly greater analgesic response than men, compatible with our previous results. Unexpectedly, men receiving the 5 mg dose of nalbuphine experienced significantly greater pain than those receiving placebo; only the 20 mg dose of nalbuphine in men produced significant analgesia compared to placebo. While a similar antianalgesic effect was not observed in women, only the 10 mg dose of nalbuphine produced significant analgesia compared to placebo. These results suggest that the optimal analgesic dose of nalbuphine for women is lower than the highest dose that can be safely administered. In contrast, the antianalgesic effect of nalbuphine suggests avoidance of its routine use for postoperative analgesia in men until further studies clarify this issue. Because gender differences in other mixed kappa agonists/antagonists (i.e. pentazocine and butorphanol) have previously been shown, these results may generally apply to this class of opioid analgesics.",E,E

During the RDM limb of the study active drug was administered in the evening and placebo in the morning. Dextromoramide was provided as escape analgesia throughout the study. Following a 5-day screening period, during which stability of oral opioid dose was verified, patients underwent two 5-day treatment periods, (one MST, one RDM) in random sequence. Pain scores, escape analgesia requirements and side-effects were compared using data from days 3, 4 and 5 of each treatment period. Any events or medication changes occurring during the study period thought liable to influence analgesia were regarded as protocol violations. Overall assessment and period preference was assessed by direct questioning. RDM treatment was regarded as successful if the amount of escape medication required during the RDM period was equal to or less than that required during the MST period.; Forty-seven patients were included in the study, of whom 40 completed both periods [the intention to treat (ITT) population], 31 in strict accordance with the protocol [the per protocol (PP) population]. Results were similar for both populations. There was no significant difference in pain scores or incidence of adverse events occurring during the MST and RDM periods.

When patients complained of pain in the recovery room, patients were randomized to receive either tramadol or morphine by titration in 30 min to achieve analgesia (VAS < or =4). Equivalent volumes containing either 30 mg x ml(-1) tramadol or 1 mg x ml(-1) morphine were used for PCA with a lockout interval of 10 min. The patients were followed six-hourly for 48 hr for VAS, satisfaction rate, analgesic dose, and side effects.; Patients obtained adequate analgesia with either drug. More patients had very good satisfaction scores in the morphine group in the recovery room (43% vs. 23%, P<0.05) and at 24 hr (40% vs. 20%, P<0.05) than those in the tramadol group. More nausea was evident in the tramadol group (48% vs. 11% in recovery room and 28% vs. 12% in 24 hr, P<0.05) than in the morphine group. Vomiting was also more (28% vs. 5% in recovery room, 15% vs. 3% in 24 hr, P<0.05). Morphine produced more sleepiness (45% vs. 23% in recovery room, P<0.05 and 35% vs. 15% in 24 hr, P<0.05).; Tramadol PCA can provide effective analgesia following major orthopedic surgery provided sufficiently high doses are given for loading and by patient demand. However, the incidence of nausea/vomiting is also higher causing decreased satisfaction.",E,E

Such interactions have been demonstrated at two distinct sites: (1) modulation of NMDA receptor-mediated electrophysiological events by opioids; and (2) intracellular events involving interactions between NMDA and opioid receptors. Furthermore, a considerable number of studies have shown the involvement of such interactions in neural mechanisms of nociceptive transmission, antinociception in acute and chronic pain states, opioid tolerance/dependence, and neuroplasticity. Importantly, emerging evidence indicates that activation of NMDA receptors may differentially modulate functions mediated by distinct opioid receptor subtypes, namely mu, delta, and kappa receptors. These studies have greatly enriched our knowledge regarding both NMDA and opioid receptor systems and have shed light on neurobiology of both acute and chronic pain. The advancement of such knowledge also promotes new strategies for better clinical management of pain patients.",3,E

This study examined intraarticular morphine in chronic arthritis. We undertook a randomized double-blind comparison between intraarticular morphine (3 mg), dexamethasone (4 mg) and saline (3 ml) in 44 patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis or osteoarthritis of the knee. Pain (the primary outcome measure) was assessed at rest and during activity for 6 days using a visual analog scale (VAS) and the McGill pain questionnaire. Before drug injections and on day 6 synovial leukocyte counts (the secondary outcome measure) were taken. During the first 6 h after injection both morphine and dexamethasone significantly reduced VAS and pain rating indices (PRI) in comparison to saline. Both substances also produced a significant reduction of PRI compared to saline during the subsequent 5 days. No patient displayed untoward side effects. Synovial leukocyte counts were lower after morphine than after saline. In conclusion, intraarticular morphine produces analgesia of similar magnitude to dexamethasone and it may have antiinflammatory actions in chronic arthritis.",E,E

Subjects participated in this single blind, placebo controlled study for up to 8 days. We gave placebo the first day; for the remainder of the study, we gave intravenous methylnaltrexone (0.05-0.45 mg/kg) twice daily. During the study period, we recorded oral-cecal transit time and opioid withdrawal symptoms, as well as laxation response based on the frequency and consistency of the stools. Subjects 1 and 2 who were administered methylnaltrexone 0.45 mg/kg, a dose previously administered in normal volunteers, showed immediate positive laxation. Subject 2, after positive laxation response, had severe abdominal cramping, but showed no opioid systemic signs of withdrawal. The subject was discontinued due to the cramping. In Subjects 3 and 4, we reduced the methylnaltrexone dose to 0.05-0.15 mg/kg. The latter two subjects also had an immediate laxation response during and after intravenous medication without significant side effects. The stool frequency of these four subjects increased from 1-2 times per week before the study to approximately 1.5 stool per day during the treatment period. Oral-cecal transit times of Subjects 1, 3, and 4 were reduced from 150, 150 and 150 min (after placebo) to 90, 60 and 60 min (with methylnaltrexone), respectively. Our preliminary results demonstrate that low dose intravenous methylnaltrexone effectively reversed chronic methadone-induced constipation and delay in gut transit time. Thus, we anticipate that cancer patients receiving chronic opioids may also have increased sensitivity to methylnaltrexone, and that low dose methylnaltrexone may have clinical utility in managing opioid-induced constipation in chronic-pain patients.",E,E

The two objectives of that review were: a) to identify the factors which may explain the variability of tolerance and dependence in clinical practice; b) to analyse the cellular mechanisms of occurrence of those phenomenons.; To our own file, we added articles retrieved in the Medline database, using, alone or in combination, following key-words (opiate, tolerance, dependence, opiate receptor, pain treatment, cAMP, cGMP, NO, NMDA, protein kinase, gene). Out of nearly 450 articles, we selected less than 200.; Tolerance, defined as loss of opioid efficacy with time, is extremely variable and depends on pain mechanisms, intrinsic efficacy and administration modality of the opioid, as well as co-administration of other agents. Physical dependence is a consequence of the intrinsic and extrinsic adaptations concerning structures as locus coeruleus, paragigantocellular nucleus, spinal cord. Acute and chronic application of opiates and withdrawal give rise to cellular adaptations which depend on the nature and efficacy of the opiate, the type of receptor and second messengers, as well as the type of cell line under study. These cellular mechanisms have consequences on neuronal excitability and gene expression. They constitute a model of cellular tolerance and dependence, but cannot explain the subtelties encountered in clinical practice.",E,E

It is unclear whether epidural or systemic pain therapy is superior in terms of postoperative pain relief, patients' comfort and side effects. A new therapeutic approach, intraarticular opioids, has been suggested with the detection of opioid receptors in inflamed tissue. This method has proven suitable for clinical use in small operations (e.g. knee arthroscopy). In this study, we compared epidural analgesia and intraarticular application of morphine plus ""on-demand"" intravenous analgesia to ""on-demand"" intravenous analgesia alone.; Thirty-seven patients, scheduled for total knee arthroplasty, were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: in group 1 (EPI) patients received bolus doses of morphine via an epidural catheter; in group 2 (IA) an intraarticular bolus of 1 mg of morphine was applied at the end of the operation with subsequent use of a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump; group 3 (Control), in which only PCA was provided, served as control for both analgesic procedures. Main outcome measures included visual analogue pain scales, total morphine consumption, and stress hormones.; No statistically significant differences in visual analogue pain scales could be detected between the three groups. Application of intraarticular morphine did not reduce the amount of analgesics required for postoperative analgesia as compared to intravenous analgesia alone. Application of epidural morphine significantly suppressed beta-endorphine release, but did not significantly influence other stress hormones as compared to the control group.; Epidural and intravenous analgesia after total knee arthroplasty are equivalent methods of pain relief. In major orthopaedic procedures, application of intraarticular morphine does not reduce analgesic requirements.",E,E

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the benefit of pancreaticoduodenectomy in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis. The results were evaluated by standard descriptive statistics. In a retrospective study, we reviewed the patients at a single institution undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy between 1994 and 1997 for complications of chronic pancreatitis. Patients were evaluated for preoperative indication for surgery and perioperative morbidity and mortality, as well as long-term results. Thirty-two patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for chronic pancreatitis; 56 per cent (18) underwent pylorus-preserving and 44 per cent (14) underwent classic pancreaticoduodenectomy. The mean age of these patients was 56+/-14.7 years (range, 23-79). All patients underwent preoperative CT scan and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The preoperative indication for surgery in 81 per cent (26) of these patients was intractable pain in the setting of a nondilated pancreatic duct. The other 19 per cent were treated for biliary/pancreatic duct stricture and pancreatic head fibrosis (mass suspicious of malignancy). Fifty-three per cent of the patients had a history of previous abdominal surgery. There were no perioperative deaths. The mean postoperative stay was 12.2+/-7.4 days. The postoperative morbidity rate was 31 per cent (10), consisting of 25 per cent with delayed gastric emptying, 3 per cent with pneumonia, and 3 per cent with wound infections. There was no occurrence of pancreatic fistulas. With a mean follow-up of 40 months (range, 10-52 months), 85 per cent reported a significant improvement in pain with 71 per cent being pain free and not requiring narcotics. Twenty per cent developed new-onset diabetes. The overall event survival rate at 5 years was 97 per cent.

Animal studies confirm that these drugs alleviate persistent or tonic pain. Little is known, however, about the neural systems underlying the suppression of tonic pain except that they are different from those mediating the suppression of phasic (i.e., sharp and short-lasting) pain. Although spinal and brainstem-descending pain suppression mechanisms play a role in mediating the inhibition of tonic pain, it appears that this response is additionally mediated by the activation of mechanisms lying rostral to the brainstem. Recent studies suggest that the activation of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons, arising from the cell bodies of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), plays an important role in mediating the suppression of tonic pain. Other studies suggest that this pain-suppression system involving the activation of mesolimbic DA neurons is naturally triggered by exposure to stress, through the endogenous release of opioids and substance P (SP) in the midbrain.",E,E

10626931,Stereotactic surgery: what is past is prologue.,Brain; Brain Diseases; Computers; Forecasting; Humans; Intraoperative Period; Neurosurgery; Robotics; Stereotaxic Techniques,"Kelly, P J","Two old and simple simple concepts, a three-dimensional positioning stage and a coordinate system, were combined in 1906 to create a new one: the stereotactic method. For 25 years, it found little application until it was rediscovered for investigations in small animals. After the first human subcortical stereotactic procedure was performed in 1947, stereotactic methods found greatest application in the placement of subcortical lesions in the treatment of movement disorders. Rapid advances in the development of instrumentation, methods, and understanding of human neuroanatomy and neurophysiology resulted. However, a dormant period followed the introduction of L-dopa in 1968. The advent of computer-based medical imaging applied to the stereotactic method encouraged adaptation of stereotactic methods to the management of intracranial tumors, the rapid development of new surgical hardware, and the rediscovery of old methods and evolution of new ones for the treatment of movement disorders. In addition, the incorporation of computer systems as stereotactic surgical instruments further increased the capabilities of stereotactic methods. Radiosurgical applications increased with the proliferation of gamma units and the development of linear accelerator-based radiosurgical methods. Computers are used to fuse and reformat imaging databases for surgical planning, simulation, and frameless stereotactic intraoperative guidance. As a result, surgical procedures have become more effective in meeting preoperative goals and less invasive. Low-cost, high-speed, microprocessor-based workstation computers and intuitive user interfaces have increased the acceptance into mainstream neurosurgery. It is anticipated that a significant portion of neurosurgery, and probably most surgical procedures in general, will comprise computer-based interventions guided by volumetric imaging-defined data sets acquired preoperatively or by intraoperative imaging systems. The stereotactic surgery of the future may employ all or a combination of the following technologies: frameless stereotactic surgery, robotic technology, microrobotic dexterity enhancement, and telepresence robotics.",E,E

Blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output were recorded, as well as blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, bleeding time, hematuria or proteinuria, and aspartate aminotransferase. Side effects such as nausea and vomiting were noted. Morphine was used for rescue treatment if the patient continued to have significant pain > or =30 mins after study drug administration.; Of the 102 children studied, 48 received morphine and 54 received ketorolac. The percentage of patients reporting pain relief in the first and second hours after drug administration was not different between groups. Likewise, the proportion of patients who met the criteria for pain relief during the entire evaluation period was not different between groups. There was a trend toward fewer patients who received ketorolac requiring remedication in the first 4 hrs compared with those who received morphine, but this trend did not reach statistical significance. More patients in the morphine group failed to achieve pain relief at any time after the dose compared with those who received ketorolac. There were no differences between the two groups in physiologic or laboratory variables. Vomiting was more common in patients who received ketorolac.; Ketorolac is comparable to morphine in relief of postoperative pain in children. A single dose of ketorolac does not result in abnormal postoperative bleeding or alter renal function. However, ketorolac may cause nausea and vomiting in some patients.",E,E

Moreover, we investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol with respect to possible tolerance and compared the quality of sedation of both propofol formulations and their lipid load.; After institutional approval and written consent, 16 ASA II-IV patients were included in this study. Main inclusion criterion was the necessity for prolonged sedation/analgesia for at least 72 h. Sedation was induced and maintained using continuous infusion of propofol 1% (n = 7) or 2% (n = 9). Analgesia was maintained with continuous infusion of alfentanil. The EEG was recorded from four leads (Fp1,2 and C3,4) and the EEG median frequency was obtained from the power spectrum (0.5-32 Hz). Propofol was administered computer-controlled with a median frequency setpoint depending on the depth of sedation which was assessed clinically using a modified Ramsay score. Alfentanil was applied as TCI. Arterial plasma concentrations were measured by HPLC (propofol) and RIA (alfentanil). Pharmacokinetics of propofol and alfentanil were derived using a three compartment model.; All patients were successfully sedated for 77 +/- 9 h. The median EEG frequency during sedation was stable at 1.5 +/- 0.2 Hz. The sedation score increased from 1 in the first 12 h to values between 2 and 3 for the remaining sedation period. At the same time, propofol plasma concentrations increased from 0.7 +/- 0.3 microgram/ml to 1.8 +/- 1.3 micrograms/ml. The patients required an average of 2.5 mg/kg/h propofol and 0.030 mg/kg/h alfentanil. Pharmacokinetics of propofol 2% showed an increased volume of distribution when compared to propofol 1%. Alfentanil clearance was found to be reduced with four patients having extremely small clearance values (33 +/- 3 ml/min). Triglyceride values increased up to 4.5 +/- 1.2 mmol/l for patients receiving propofol 1% and remained within normal range for propofol 2%.; The EEG median frequency can be used for closed-loop control of propofol even for long-term sedation in critically ill patients. EEG median frequencies were similarly low as in deeply anaesthetised patients. No differences in quality of sedation were seen between the two propofol formulations, but propofol 2% seems to be advantageous due to lower lipid load and triglyceride values. Increasing concentrations of propofol at unchanged sedation scores and EEG median frequencies may indicate development of tolerance.",E,E

Following skin closure, naloxone or placebo was injected intravenously to erase the aftereffects of the morphine. After total recovery, the PCA pump was set to inject epidural morphine. Pain intensity after surgery was measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS), and the amount of morphine used within 48h after surgery. PA was significantly effective for removal surgery, but ineffective for fracture or arthritic surgery. For the fracture and arthritic surgery PA treatment groups, there was a significant correlation between pre- and postsurgical (6h) spontaneous pain, while the corresponding control groups showed no significant correlation. Postsurgical VAS values in the fracture and arthritic surgery control groups increased significantly compared with presurgical VAS values. PA was effective when presurgical pain was absent, but ineffective when presurgical pain was present. We propose that central sensitization is already established by presurgical pain, and preserved until the termination of surgery. The ineffectiveness of PA did not depend on whether the pain was acute (fracture surgery) or chronic (arthritic surgery).",E,E

One-hundred-and-eighty-nine chronic non-malignant pain patients were studied. At referral, and after 3 and 6 months patients filled in questionnaires evaluating pain intensity, health related quality of life (HRQL) and use of analgesics. HRQL was evaluated using the Medical Outcome Study-Short Form (SF-36), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) and the Psychological General Well-being Scale (PGWB). After 6 months patients allocated to MPT (n=63) reported statistically significant reduction in pain intensity (VAS-score, P<0.001), improvement in psychological well-being (PGWB, P<0.001), quality of sleep (P<0.05) and physical functioning (SF-36-Phycical Functioning, P<0.05). No improvements were seen in the GP-group (n=63). In the WL-group (n=63) a statistically significant deterioration was observed in PGWB-scores, HAD-scores and in 6 of 8 SF-36-subscores (P </= 0.05). A reduction in use of opioids administered on demand was obtained in the group receiving MPT (P<0.001). In the MPT- and GP-groups a decrease in the use of short acting opioids was observed (P<0.01). No change in use of analgesics was seen in the WL-group. The study showed that (i) in the MPT-group there was a significant reduction in pain intensity and improvement of HRQL compared to the WL-group, and (ii) the mere establishment of a pain diagnosis and a pain management plan by a pain specialist was not sufficient to enable the referring GP to manage severely chronic pain patients.",E,E

Although it is well-established that morphine is a mu-opioid agonist, this is not the case for oxycodone. Instead, our recent studies have shown that oxycodone appears to be a kappa-opioid agonist (Ross and Smith, 1997). In the current study, we now show that co-administration of sub-antinociceptive doses of oxycodone (putative kappa-opioid agonist) with morphine (mu-opioid agonist) to rats by both the intracerebroventricular and by systemic routes (intraperitoneal and subcutaneous), results in markedly increased (synergistic) levels of antinociception. Behaviourally, rats co-administered sub-antinociceptive doses of oxycodone and morphine were similar to control rats dosed with saline, whereas rats that received equi-potent doses of either opioid alone, were markedly sedated. These results suggest that co-administration of sub-analgesic doses of oxycodone and morphine to patients may provide excellent pain relief with a reduction in opioid-related CNS side-effects. Controlled clinical trials in appropriate patient populations are required to evaluate this possibility.(1)",E,E
10668859,Clinical pharmacokinetics of transdermal opioids: focus on transdermal fentanyl.,"Administration, Cutaneous; Analgesics, Opioid; Animals; Fentanyl; Humans; Pain","Grond, S; Radbruch, L; Lehmann, K A","Transdermal delivery allows continuous systemic application of opioids through the intact skin. This review analyses the pharmacokinetic properties of transdermal opioid administration in the context of clinical experience, with a focus on fentanyl. A transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) for fentanyl has been developed. The amount of fentanyl released is proportional to the surface area of the TTS, which is available in different sizes. After the first application of a TTS, a fentanyl depot concentrates in the upper skin layers and it takes several hours until clinical effects are observed. The time from application to minimal effective and maximum serum concentrations is 1.2 to 40 hours and 12 to 48 hours, respectively. Steady state is reached on the third day, and can be maintained as long as patches are renewed. Within each 72-hour period, serum concentrations decrease gradually over the second and third days. When a TTS is removed, fentanyl continues to be absorbed into the systemic circulation from the cutaneous depot. The terminal half-life for TTS fentanyl is approximately 13 to 25 hours. The interindividual variability of serum concentrations, partly caused by different clearance rates, is markedly larger than the intraindividual variability. The effectiveness of TTS fentanyl was first demonstrated in acute postoperative pain. However, the slow pharmacokinetics and large variability of TTS fentanyl, together with the relatively short duration of postoperative pain, precluded adequate dose finding and led to inadequate pain relief or, especially, a high incidence of respiratory depression; such use is now contraindicated. Conversely, in cancer pain, TTS fentanyl offers an interesting alternative to oral morphine, and its effectiveness and tolerability in this indication has been demonstrated by a number of trials. Its usefulness in chronic pain of nonmalignant origin remains to be confirmed in controlled trials. In general, TTS fentanyl produces the same adverse effects as other opioids, mainly sedation, nausea, vomiting and constipation. In comparison with oral morphine, TTS fentanyl causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. The risk of hypoventilation is comparatively low in cancer patients. Sufentanil and buprenorphine may also be suitable for transdermal delivery, but clinical results are not yet available. Transdermal morphine is only useful if applied to de-epithelialised skin. However, iontophoresis may allow transdermal administration of opioids, including morphine, with a rapid achievement of steady state concentrations and the ability to adjust delivery rates. This would be beneficial for acute and/or breakthrough pain, and initial clinical trials are in progress.",I,E

After obtaining the baseline data, the patient was given 3 micrograms/kg fentanyl (Group F) or 3 mg/kg tramadol (Group T). Then induction of anesthesia in a uniform and standardized manner was carried out by an anesthesiologist who was blind to the medication. The hemodynamic parameters were measured and recorded immediately after induction but prior to laryngoscopy, 3, 6, and 9 min after intubation, and before incision. We also observed any unusual effect in the postoperative care unit. Chi-square test, Student's t-test and paired t-test were used for statistical comparison. A P less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.; All patients had a successful induction and intubation. Differences in baseline values were not significant, nor were the differences in the values following induction.

Satisfaction scores were better in the PCEA group. Although incidence of delirium was comparable in the PCA and PCEA groups (24% vs. 26%, respectively), mental status was improved on the fourth and fifth postoperative days in the PCEA group. The PCEA group recovered bowel function more quickly than did the PCA group. Cardiopulmonary complications were similar in the two groups.; After major abdominal surgery in the elderly patient, patient-controlled analgesia, regardless of the route (epidural or parenteral), is effective.

We compared baseline sedation and analgesia with baseline sedation and PCA.; Fifty-six consecutive patients were alternatively allocated to 1 of 2 groups: either to control group (n = 28) to receive standard sedation (meperidine and midazolam as baseline and additional doses of meperidine administered by the anesthesiologist) or to a PCA group (n = 28) to receive the same baseline premedication but additional analgesia with meperidine being self-administered. Cardiopulmonary parameters were recorded and tolerance for the examination was evaluated by a numeric rating scale, 0 meaning ""no pain"" and 10 meaning ""maximal pain.""; Patients' mean pain score (on a scale of 0 to 10) was 4.85 +/- 3.74 for the PCA group and 5.30 +/- 3.53 (not significant) for the control group. Physicians' assessment of patient tolerance registered a lower numeric rating score than patients' assessment. The duration of the procedure was slightly longer in the PCA group. None of the patients experienced a decline in oxygen saturation below 90%; a decrease in expiratory carbon dioxide during the examination was noted in both groups of patients, particularly during the first minutes of the examination. Mean additional sedation per patient in the PCA group was slightly higher, but not significantly different.; Our results suggest that patient-controlled analgesia during colonoscopy is as effective as standard sedation with respect to patient tolerance and safety of the examination.",E,E

Onset and quality of analgesia were similar in both groups, with median visual analogue scale pain scores of 0 achieved in 5-10 min. Median duration of analgesia was longer in group B (median 120 (range 90-120) min) compared with group A (75 (75-105) min) (P = 0.013).

The clinical utility of multiple doses of OTFC in the treatment of ""breakthrough"" cancer pain is under evaluation. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pharmacokinetics of OTFC do not change with multiple dosing.; Twelve healthy adult volunteers received intravenous fentanyl (15 microg/kg) or OTFC (three consecutive doses of 800 microg) on separate study sessions. Arterial blood samples were collected for determination of fentanyl plasma concentration by radioimmunoassay. The descriptive pharmacokinetic parameters (maximum concentration, minimum concentration, and time to maximum concentration) were identified from the raw data and subjected to a nonparametric analysis of variance. Population pharmacokinetic models for all subjects and separate models for each subject were developed to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters of fentanyl after multiple OTFC doses.; The shapes of the profiles of plasma concentration versus time for each dose of OTFC were grossly similar. No change was noted for maximum concentration or time to maximum concentration over the three doses, while minimum concentration did show a significantly increasing trend. Terminal half-lives for intravenous fentanyl and OTFC were similar. A two-compartment population pharmacokinetic model adequately represented the central tendency of the data from all subjects. Individual subject data were best described by either two- or three-compartment pharmacokinetic models. These models demonstrated rapid and substantial absorption of OTFC that did not change systematically with time and multiple dosing.; The pharmacokinetics of OTFC were similar among subjects and did not change with multiple dosing. Multiple OTFC dosing regimens within the dosage schedule examined in this study can thus be formulated without concern about nonlinear accumulation.",E,E

These guidelines define standards of care for acute and chronic cancer pain management and address many of the problems with meperidine and its metabolite, normeperidine. The purpose of this study was to determine whether meperidine was prescribed in compliance with AHCPR guidelines, whether patients exhibited any adverse reactions to meperidine, and to determine the analgesic efficacy of meperidine. Three hundred inpatient charts were reviewed and identified meperidine as the primary analgesic in 157 nonobstetric inpatients. Age, sex, weight, dosing interval, route of administration, duration of meperidine use, serum chemistry values, primary diagnosis, associated medical conditions, and medications concurrently being taken with meperidine were the parameters analyzed. An interview was conducted to ascertain medical and drug history, chronicity of pain syndromes, analgesic drug history, and analgesic efficacy. A visual analog scale for pain (range = 0 to 10) and an analgesic satisfaction survey (range = 1 to 5) were used. Of 157 patients, 124 (79.8%) were in conflict with AHCPR guidelines. The most frequent conflict was found to be suboptimal dosing regimen and treatment of chronic pain. Often concurrent analgesics were given with the meperidine to achieve adequate analgesia. Higher analgesic satisfaction scores were noted when meperidine was given with concurrent analgesics. Meperidine also was administered to patients in renal failure or with medications contraindicated with meperidine use. No significant adverse effects were noted with meperidine use in this sample population other than an increased incidence of confusion in the elderly population.",E,E

Patients acted as their own controls as only one foot received the active drug. Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores and wound tenderness were measured over 72 h. Diamorphine did not improve median VAS area under the curve pain scores during the first 6 h after surgery (33 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 25-46) vs 24 (17-35)).

10741821,What is the quality of the implemented meta-analytic procedures in chronic pain treatment meta-analyses?,Chronic Disease; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Humans; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Pain Management,"Fishbain, D; Cutler, R B; Rosomoff, H L; Rosomoff, R S","Meta-analysis (MA) is the application of quantitative techniques for the purposes of summarizing data from individual studies. This type of review has many advantages over traditional reviews. However, different investigators performing MAs on the same data set have reached different conclusions. These reliability problems have been attributed to differences in the quality of the implemented meta-analytic procedures. We, therefore, examined the chronic pain treatment meta-analytic literature for MA procedure quality and for the consistency of conclusions. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, OUTCOME MEASURES: Chronic pain treatment MAs were isolated according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data from these MAs were abstracted into structured tables. Table format reflected eight meta-analytic procedures identified previously as being important to MA implementation quality. These were: adequacy of retrieval, publication bias, inclusion/exclusion criteria, abstraction of data, quality, homogeneity/heterogeneity, independence, and statistical versus clinical interpretation. Each meta-analytic procedure was then independently rated by two raters. Rating results were then analyzed by procedure for each individual MA for percentage scores out of 100%, and mean scores. For MAs addressing the same topic area (pain facility treatment, antidepressant treatment, manipulation treatment) direction of effect size was noted. Mean effect sizes were calculated for these subgroups.; Sixteen chronic pain treatment MAs fulfilled inclusion/exclusion criteria. Mean procedure ratings indicated that four procedures may not be implemented adequately. These were publication bias, abstraction of data, quality, and homogeneity/heterogeneity. There was wide MA implementation score variability, with 37.5% scoring less than 50%. The effect sizes of the MA subgroups demonstrated replicate nonvariability.; Some meta-analytic procedures could be interpreted to be implemented inadequately in some chronic pain treatment MAs. There is wide variability between individual chronic pain treatment MAs on adequacy of implementation of these procedures. However, the effect sizes of the different MA subgroups demonstrated consistency. This finding indicates that for these MA subgroups, MA results are consistent between authors. In addition, chronic pain MAs, as compared with other groups of MAs, appear to address some of the procedures in a more adequate fashion. Future chronic pain MAs should concentrate on improving the quality of their methods with particular emphasis on the above four procedures. Because of potential validity problems with these results, these data cannot and should not be used to make administrative decisions about previous MAs.",E,E

Few studies have evaluated the role of opioid analgesics in treating the pain of OA.; This randomized, double blind, parallel group study compared the efficacy and safety of a 12 hourly controlled release codeine formulation (Codeine Contin) with placebo in patients with chronic pain due to OA of the hips and/or knees. The 4 week treatment period, following an analgesic washout phase of 2-7 days, included weekly clinic evaluations, at which the dose was escalated as appropriate, and daily patient diary completion. Pain (daily), stiffness, and physical function (weekly) were assessed using the multidimensional, self-administered WOMAC (visual analog scale version) questionnaire.; Sixty-six eligible patients completed the study. The mean initial and final daily doses of controlled release codeine were 50 mg every 12 h at baseline and 159 mg every 12 h at the final assessment. All variables in the efficacy analysis indicated superiority of controlled release codeine over placebo. The WOMAC pain scale showed an improvement of 44.8% over baseline in the controlled release codeine group compared with 12.3% taking placebo (p = 0.0004). For the WOMAC stiffness and physical function scales the improvements over baseline on controlled release codeine were 47.7% and 49.3%, respectively compared with 17.0% and 17.0%, respectively, with placebo (p = 0.003; p = 0.0007).

Three hundred eighty outpatients between 21 and 79 years with chronic low back pain with no or a distant history of back surgery enrolled in the open label phase and were treated with tramadol up to 400 mg/day. At the end of the open label phase, patients who tolerated tramadol and perceived benefit from it were randomized to continue treatment with tramadol or to convert to placebo in the double blind phase. Reasons for discontinuing from the open label phase included adverse events, 78 patients (20.5%); drug ineffective, 23 patients (6.1%); and other reasons, 25 patients (6.6%). Two hundred fifty-four patients entered the double blind phase, during which the daily dose was maintained within the range 200-400 mg tramadol or equivalent amount of placebo. The primary outcome measure in the double blind phase was the time to discontinuation due to inadequate pain relief.; The distribution of time to therapeutic failure was significantly (p < or = 0.0001) different in the tramadol group compared to placebo. Kaplan-Meier estimate of the cumulative discontinuation rate due to therapeutic failure was 20.7% in the tramadol group and 51.3% in the placebo group.

Over the past two centuries, opium and its derivatives have become the most widely used analgesics for severe pain. Before the development of general anesthesia, surgery was only performed out of extreme necessity. It is probable that an analgesic such as opium would have been given following surgery although its use may not have been recorded. The first description of postoperative opium was by James Moore in 1784. Morphine was isolated from opium by Friedrich Serturner in 1805. However, it was not until the development of the hypodermic needle and syringe nearly 50 yr later that the use of morphine became widespread. Over the last century, various delivery systems for morphine have been developed including subarachanoid and epidural injection, and more recently patient-controlled intravenous, epidural and intranasal analgesia. In addition, many new opioids have been synthesized.; Since its isolation from opium almost 200 yr ago, morphine remains the most widely used analgesic and the standard against which all new opioids for postoperative pain relief are compared.",E,E

Experimental and clinical studies indicate that NMDA-receptor antagonists may potentiate the effect of analgesics such as morphine, local anesthetics and NSAIDs. Results from previous clinical studies of dextromethorphan in postoperative pain are conflicting, possibly related to administration of insufficient doses of the drug. Fifty patients scheduled for non-malignant elective abdominal hysterectomy in general anesthesia were randomized to receive oral dextromethorphan 150 mg, or placebo 1 h before surgery. The patients received patient-controlled analgesia with morphine for 24 h postoperatively as the only analgesic. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine consumption was reduced with 30% from 0-4 h after operation in patients receiving dextromethorphan compared with placebo (P=0.02); no differences were observed from 5-24 h postoperatively. There were no significant differences between groups for visual analogue scale scores at rest, during cough, or during mobilization, pressure pain detection thresholds, von Frey hair pain detection thresholds, or peak flow. At 24 h after operation, hyperalgesia to von Frey hair stimulation proximal to the surgical wound was easily detected in 23 of 25 patients receiving dextromethorphan, and in 22 of 25 patients receiving placebo, with no significant difference between groups. Pooled data from both groups showed a weak but significant correlation between the extent of hyperalgesia at 24 h after operation, and total 24 h postoperative PCA morphine consumption (Rs=0.28, P=0.05). Three months postoperatively, hyperalgesia was still detectable in 18 of 22 examined patients in the dextromethorphan group, and in 16 of 23 patients in the placebo group, without statistical differences between groups. There were no significant differences in side-effects (nausea, vomiting, sedation). In conclusion, oral dextromethorphan 150 mg reduced PCA morphine consumption immediately (0-4 h) after hysterectomy, without prolonged effects on pain or wound hyperalgesia. A positive correlation between the magnitude of wound hyperalgesia at 24 h after operation, and total 24 h postoperative PCA morphine consumption was demonstrated.",E,E

The central nervous system (CNS) is considered an immune privileged site. Therefore, non-HLA-matched and unencapsulated tissue was grafted in 15 patients and 1 sham control in a series of at least 20 grafts. We observed an increase in CSF lymphocyte counts in 15/20 allografts (75%). In contrast to peripheral blood, CD4 T cells predominated in the CSF, but failed to exhibit an activated phenotype (CD25+ CD45RO+ HLA-DR+). The positive effect of graft on pain, the high met-enkephalin levels, the absence of any increase in CSF cytokine levels particularly for IFN-gamma or IL-2 (but not IL-10 and IL-6), indirectly indicated that the graft was tolerated despite the presence of CSF lymphocytes. The single treatment failure and three of four cases of partial efficacy occurred in grafts where CSF lymphocytes were present. Moreover, when assayed (n = 7), the CD4+ CSF lymphocytes still retained the capacity to exhibit ex vivo a normal or enhanced frequency of T CD4 cells producing IFN-gamma and IL-2. Taken together, our observations indicate that impairment of the local immunosuppressive balance can lead to activation of those CSF CD4 T cells and drive a rejection process. This study suggests further work on the purification and/or the immunoisolation of tissues grafted in the CNS will be necessary, particularly when the possibility of long-term and repeated grafting is considered.",E,E

One approach is to optimize currently active analgesic treatments, notably by reducing their side effects. An example of this approach is the recent development of a novel class of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors, that lack the limiting gastrointestinal side effects of the traditional NSAIDs. Another approach, based on the recent development of molecular biology, is to develop analgesic compounds acting on new targets. These include notably ion channel blockers (TTX-resistant sodium channel blockers specific for nociceptors, N-type calcium channel blockers), nicotine receptor agonists, peptide receptor antagonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, vanilloids, new opioid compounds, cannabinoids, selective alpha2-adrergic agonists, purinergic modulators. Most of these compounds are currently in preclinical or early clinical investigation.

Per- and postoperative pain is typical of acute pain and is characterized by an excess of nociception due to tissue injury, visceral distention or disease. It contrasts with chronic pain which has been going on for 3 to 6 months. PATHWAYS OF PAIN: We know that the spinothalamic cord is involved in nociceptive activity. Two pathways are of great interest. One ends in a nucleus of the hypothalamus and the second in the amygdala. Both are involved in affective and emotional activity. Treatment of postoperative pain requires first that one be aware that pain is a reality and secondly that it must be assessed with various scales. Only then can the therapeutic strategy set about using the different methods available. Strategy must be continuously assessed to improve its efficacy. Different kinds of treatment can be used during the per- and postoperative period including enteral (paracetamol, nonsteroidal analgesic and antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) or parenteral (paracetamol, NSAIDs, morphine or similar) analgesic drugs. Local anesthesia seems however to be more effective. Several factors are involved in per- and postoperative pain. Its treatment is based on comprehensive team work in which each person represents a link in the therapeutic chain. For the future, we can expect to see the appearance of new drugs, processes or associations able to prolong postoperative analgesia.",E,E

The small percentage of residents with chronic pain assessed objectively suggests the difficulty of monitoring pain progression in NFs. The prescribing of analgesic for most residents (with propoxyphene used most often, long-acting opioids used infrequently, and frequent prn use) was inconsistent with recommended pain therapy in older people and attests to the urgent need to educate NF practitioners on the appropriate use of analgesics.",3,E

Bolus + infusion started 30 min before injury and ended 50 min after it. The area of secondary hyperalgesia was quantitated using punctate (von Frey filaments) and brush stimuli (electric brush). On the day of placebo, all subjects developed an area of hyperalgesia to punctate and brush stimuli outside the thermal injury (secondary hyperalgesia). We show that ketamine or morphine treatment starting preinjury significantly reduces this development (P<0.01, both). In a previous study, we found that postinjury treatment alone with morphine did not affect secondary hyperalgesia, whereas ketamine did so significantly. The differential response to morphine administered pre- or postinjury may be relevant to the recently shown NMDA receptor mediated interaction of central hyperexcitability and morphine antinociception. The effect of ketamine supports the hypothesis of the role of NMDA receptor mediation in central hyperexcitability.",E,E

Eligible patients had 2+ palpable tenderness at 11 or more of 18 defined tender points and had a tender point index (TPI) of at least 22. Each day for 2 months, participants consumed two commercially available Chlorella-based products, 10 g of 'Sun Chlorella' tablets and 100 mL of liquid 'Wakasa Gold'. Any amelioration of symptoms was validated and quantified using semi-objective and subjective outcome measures systematically administered at clinic visits on days 0, 30 and 60 of the diet therapy. Eighteen of the 20 patients enrolled completed the 2 month trial. The average TPI for the group which at onset was 32, decreased to a mean of 25 after 2 months. This decrease was statistically significant (p = 0.01), representing a 22% decrease in pain intensity. Blood samples taken on each occasion indicated no significant alterations in serum chemistries, formed elements, and circulating lymphocyte subsets. Compilations of the results of patient interviews and self-assessment questionnaires revealed that seven patients felt that the dietary supplement had improved their fibromyalgia symptoms, while six thought they had experienced no change, and five believed the symptoms had worsened over the time of the trial. The results of this pilot study suggest that dietary Chlorella supplementation may help relieve the symptoms of fibromyalgia in some patients and that a larger, more comprehensive double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in these patients is warranted.",E,E

Forty-six patients were treated with slow-release morphine 30-1000 mg/day for 6 days and 39 of these patients were switched to transdermal fentanyl 0.6-9.6 mg/day with a conversion ratio of 100:1. Median fentanyl doses increased from 1.2 to 3.0 mg/day throughout the 30-day transdermal treatment period. Twenty-three patients completed the study. Two patients died from the basic disease while treated with transdermal fentanyl, 12 patients were excluded for various reasons, and not enough data for evaluation were available for two patients. Mean pain intensity decreased slightly after conversion although the number of patients with breakthrough pain or requiring immediate-release morphine as a rescue medication was higher with transdermal fentanyl. The number of patients with bowel movements did not change after the opioid switch but the number of patients taking laxatives was reduced significantly from 78-87% of the patients per treatment day (morphine) to 22-48% (fentanyl). Lactulose was used mainly and was reduced most drastically, but other laxatives were also used less frequently. In this study transdermal fentanyl was associated with a significantly lower use of laxatives compared to oral morphine. The difference in the degree of constipation between the two analgesic regimens should be confirmed in a randomized double-blind study that takes into account both constipation and use of laxatives.",E,E

Clinical trials, involving allogeneic graft of whole tissue explants into the subarachnoid space of the lumbar spinal cord, have already been reported. The aim of the present study was to determine whether adhesion and function of AM explants were related in some extent and how this relationship could account for improvement of AM tissue in terms of analgesic activity before grafting. Our experiments demonstrated a significant correlation between the adherent state of AM organoids during culture and a sustained secretion of Met-enkephalin and catecholamines by chromaffin cells (CC). These findings suggest that optimal culture condition for AM organoid adhesion can be defined for maintenance of tissue, prior to transplantation. Using immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and ELISA assays we showed that different cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and extracellular matrix ECM proteins were expressed and released by AM cells during culture. Adherent AM organoids expressed increased levels of specific neural CAMs (NCAM and HNK-1 epitope) and integrin chains (beta1, alpha1, alpha2, alpha4, alpha5) and deposited markedly higher levels of fibronectin, but also laminin and collagen IV. Those molecules and probably adhesion processes they control might be involved in the maintenance of the CC-secreting neuroendocrine phenotype through cellular signaling pathways.",E,E

Opioids are common anesthetic adjuvants and remain the dominant treatment for postoperative surgical pain and sedation of critically ill patients. The effect of opioids on normal thermoregulatory control is well established. However, the extent to which these drugs might inhibit fever remains unknown. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that relatively low plasma concentrations of the mu-receptor agonist alfentanil reduce fever magnitude.; Prospective, randomized, crossover study.; Outcomes Research Laboratory, at the Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, University of California, San Francisco.; Eight healthy male volunteers, aged 25-31 yrs, each studied on three separate days.; Each volunteer was given an intravenous injection of 30 IU/g interleukin (IL)-2, followed 2 hrs later by 70 IU/g. One hour after the second dose, the volunteers were randomly assigned to three doses of alfentanil: a) none (control); b) a target plasma concentration of 100 ng/mL; and c) a target concentration of 200 ng/mL. Opioid administration continued for 5 hrs.; Alfentanil significantly reduced the febrile response to pyrogen, decreasing integrated tympanic membrane temperatures from 7.5+/-2.2 degrees C x hr on the control day, to 4.9+/-1.5 degrees C x hr with 100 ng/mL alfentanil, and to 5.1+/-1.7 degrees C x hr with 200 ng/mL alfentanil (p = .011).

They can be used alone for the treatment of mild pain or as an adjunct to opioid analgesia. In children, most experience is with acetaminophen and ibuprofen. For the treatment of mild to moderate pain, these agents can be administered as needed or at fixed intervals. The latter dosing scheme may provide a more consistent serum level, thereby improving analgesia. The major advantages of acetaminophen are its availability as a suppository for PR administration and its lack of effects on renal and GI function, adverse effects that may be seen with the NSAIDs. Many of the effects on platelet functioning, RBF, and the GI tract may be eliminated with the introduction of NSAIDs that selectively inhibit COX II without effects on COX I, the enzyme present in the GI tract, renal system, and platelets. Future evaluations with these agents in the pediatric population are needed. For more severe pain, the NSAID salicylate or acetaminophen can be combined with a weak opioid, such as codeine, oxycodone, or hydrocodone. When using oral analgesics, factors that may interfere with effective analgesia include a child's refusal to take the medication, ineffective doses and dosing regimens, decreased bioavailability following PO administration, inability to tolerate PO medications because of nausea or vomiting, altered GI motility, and a delayed onset caused by slow absorption. With such caveats in mind, the PO route provides an effective and cost-effective means for many patients. It should be considered as the primary route for pediatric patients in the treatment of mild to moderate pain, even in the hospital setting.",E,E

It acts mainly as an antagonist of mu (#m) receptors and has an analgesic potency ten times greater than that of morphine. Like other opioid drugs, meperidine causes nausea, vomiting, urinary retention and respiratory depression; a point of difference, however, is that it acts on nerve fibers and has properties similar to those of local anesthetics. It has therefore been used as an alternative to other opioids for anesthetic blockade. We review the indications and contraindications of meperidine administered by different routes. For pain, epidural administration has proven to be a good alternative to intravenous administration and epidural meperidine has been combined with local anesthetics using lower doses of both drugs and producing fewer side effects. Intradural meperidine has been used as the sole anesthetic agent in various types of surgery, its principal advantage being that it provides long-lasting postoperative analgesia. Spinal meperidine has the advantage over morphine of a lower incidence of respiratory depression, particularly late-occurring depression. An intravenous route has been used for treating moderate to severe pain, for regional anesthesia, for premedication and for analgesia during anesthesia. Meperidine's action on kappa receptors has meant that it is considered the most effective drug for treating postanesthetic trembling. Although meperidine has been used effectively to treat non-surgical pain, mainly from colic, this review focuses on its usefulness in the perioperative period.",E,E

In this paper we provide an update on recent developments in the treatment of PHN. We emphasise the results of recent studies that provide an evidence-based approach for treating PHN that was not available until very recently. In randomised, controlled clinical trials, the topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and controlled release oxycodone have been shown to provide superior pain relief in patients with PHN when compared with placebo. It has also recently been demonstrated that the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline provides equivalent analgesic benefit when compared with amitriptyline, but is better tolerated. Based on these results, nortriptyline can now be considered the preferred antidepressant for the treatment of PHN, although desipramine may be used if the patient experiences unacceptable sedation from nortriptyline. The topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin and controlled release oxycodone all appear to be as effective as tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of patients with PHN, and the results of these recent studies suggest that each of these treatments should be considered early in the course of treatment. Additional controlled trials are needed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of these 4 treatments- tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, the topical lidocaine patch and controlled release opioid analgesics--used singly and in various combinations in the treatment of patients with PHN.",E,E

It has been the practice in a pain and palliative care clinic in south India to give repeated boluses of 1.5 mg of morphine intravenously every 10 min to patients presenting with severe pain. An audit of the procedure was undertaken by a retrospective study of 793 case notes. Seventy-nine per cent of patients had total relief of their pain with intravenous morphine. Three per cent of patients experienced side-effects during the procedure. These included nausea and vomiting, itching, giddiness, restlessness, dyspnoea, chest pain, disorientation and a feeling of uneasiness. Thirty-two per cent of patients had drowsiness, which was one of the end-points of the procedure. It is concluded that intravenous morphine in repeated boluses of 1.5 mg every 10 min is a safe and effective method of managing cancer pain emergencies in a clinical setting in a developing country.",E,E
10859453,Abrogation of the negative influence of opioids on IL-2 immunotherapy of renal cell cancer by melatonin.,"Adjuvants, Immunologic; Adult; Analgesics, Opioid; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Immunotherapy; Interleukin-2; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Melatonin; Middle Aged; Morphine","Lissoni, P; Mandal脿, M; Brivio, F","IL-2 immunotherapy has been proven to be effective in the treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC). However, several drugs commonly used in the palliative therapy of cancer may potentially influence IL-2 efficacy, since the anticancer immunity has appeared to depend on complex interactions between immune system and psychoneuroimmunomodulation. In particular, experimental studies and preliminary clinical investigations have shown that the opioid substances, namely morphine, may suppress the anticancer immunity and the efficacy of IL-2 itself. In contrast, other neuroactive substances, in particular the pineal hormone melatonin (MLT), have been proven to stimulate the immune response, including the anticancer immunity, and to abrogate opioid-induced immunosuppression. On this basis, a study was planned to evaluate the effect of a concomitant MLT administration on the efficacy of IL-2 immunotherapy in advanced cancer patients chronically treated with morphine for cancer-related pain. The study was carried out in 30 metastatic RCC patients under chronic therapy with morphine at oral doses ranging from 60 to 120 mg/day. Patients were randomized to receive morphine alone or morphine plus MLT (20 mg/day orally in the evening). The immunotherapeutic cycle consisted of IL-2 subcutaneous administration at a dose of 6 million IU/day for 6 days/week for 4 consecutive weeks. In nonprogressing patients, a second cycle was planned after a 21-day rest period. The percent of partial responses achieved in patients treated with morphine alone was significantly lower than that observed in patients concomitantly treated with MLT (1/16 vs. 4/14, p<0.05). Moreover, the 3-year percent of survival was significantly higher in patients concomitantly treated with MLT (p<0.01). In contrast, no diminished analgesic efficacy of morphine occurred in patients concomitantly treated with MLT. This preliminary study seems to suggest that the negative influence of morphine therapy for cancer-related pain on the clinical efficacy of IL-2 cancer immunotherapy may be abrogated by the concomitant administration of the immunomodulating pineal neurohormone MLT.",E,E

Because sensory afferents from the hip include several branches of the lumbar plexus, the authors hypothesized that a lumbar plexus block could reduce pain from a major hip procedure.; In a double-blind prospective trial, 60 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty were randomized to receive general anesthesia with (plexus group, n = 30) or without (control group, n = 30) a posterior lumbar plexus block. The block was performed after induction using a nerve stimulator, and 0.4 ml/kg bupivacaine, 0.5%, with epinephrine was injected. General anesthesia was standardized, and supplemental fentanyl was administered per hemodynamic guidelines. Postoperative pain and patient-controlled intravenous morphine use were serially assessed for 48 h.; The proportion of patients receiving supplemental fentanyl intraoperatively was more than 3 times greater in the control group (20 of 30 vs. 6 of 29, P = 0.001). In the postanesthesia care unit, a greater than fourfold reduction in pain scores was observed in the plexus group (visual analogue scale [VAS] pain score at arrival 1.3 +/- 2 vs. 5.6 +/- 3, P < 0.001), and ""rescue"" morphine boluses (administered if VAS > 3) were administered 10 times less frequently (in 2 of 28 vs. in 22 of 29 patients, P < 0.0001). Pain scores and morphine consumption remained significantly lower in the plexus group until 6 h after randomization (VAS at 6 h, 1.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 2.4 +/- 1.4, P = 0.007; cumulative morphine at 6 h, 5.6 +/- 4.7 vs. 12.6 +/- 7.5 mg, P < 0.0001). Operative and postoperative (48 h) blood loss was modestly decreased in the treated group. Epidural-like distribution of anesthesia occurred in 3 of 28 plexus group patients, but no other side-effects were noted.; Posterior lumbar plexus block provides effective analgesia for total hip arthroplasty, reducing intra- and postoperative opioid requirements. Moreover, blood loss during and after the procedure is diminished. Epidural anesthetic distribution should be anticipated in a minority of cases.",E,E

The present longitudinal survey studied 15 patients transplanted for intractable cancer pain after failure of systemic opioids due to the persistence of undesirable side-effects. Before inclusion, all the patients had their pain controlled by daily intrathecal (I-Th) morphine administration. The main evaluation criteria of analgesic activity of the chromaffin cell allograft was the complementary requirement of analgesics and in particular the consumption of I-Th morphine required to maintain effective pain control. Out of the 12 patients who profited from enhanced analgesia with long-term follow-up (average 4.5 months), five no longer required the I-Th morphine (with prolonged interruption of systemic opioids as well), two durably decreased I-Th morphine intake and five were stabilized until the end of their follow-up. Durable decline and stabilization were interpreted as indicative of analgesic activity by comparison with the usual dose escalation observed during disease progression. In most cases, we noted a relationship between analgesic responses and CSF met-enkephalin levels. The results of this phase II open study demonstrate the feasibility and the safety of this approach using chromaffin cell grafts for long-term relief of intractable cancer pain. However, while analgesic efficacy was indicated by the reduction or stabilization in complementary opioid intake, these observations will need to be confirmed in a controlled trial in a larger series of patients.",E,E

Complete analgesia was achieved during a trial period of 2 weeks. Thereafter, a spinal cord stimulator was implanted. At the time of writing, 11 months after implantation, the degree of analgesia is complete.

Analgesia was assessed over 8 hours.; Mean pain relief (PR) scores were similar for the hydrocodone with ibuprofen and oxycodone with acetaminophen groups (n = 61 and 59, respectively) at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 7 hours and significantly greater for the hydrocodone with ibuprofen group at 5, 6, and 8 hours (P < or = 0.05). Mean pain intensity difference (PID) scores were similar for hydrocodone with ibuprofen and oxycodone with acetaminophen at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 4 hours and significantly greater for hydrocodone with ibuprofen at 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours (P < or = 0.05). Total PR scores were similar for hydrocodone with ibuprofen and oxycodone with acetaminophen for the 0- to 3- and 0- to 4-hour intervals and significantly greater for hydrocodone with ibuprofen for the 0- to 6- and 0- to 8-hour intervals (P < 0.05). The sum of the PID scores was similar for hydrocodone with ibuprofen and oxycodone with acetaminophen for the 0- to 3-, 0- to 4-, 0- to 6-, and 0- to 8-hour intervals. The median estimated time to onset of analgesia, mean peak PR score, median time to remedication, and mean global assessment score were similar for hydrocodone with ibuprofen and oxycodone with acetaminophen. Assay sensitivity was demonstrated by the presence of statistically significant differences between both active treatments and placebo (n = 60). The number of patients experiencing adverse events was similar for each of the 3 groups (11 [18.0%], hydrocodone with ibuprofen; 7 [11.9%], oxycodone with acetaminophen; and 6 [10.0%], placebo).; In this study, a 2-tablet dose of combination hydrocodone 7.5 mg and ibuprofen 200 mg was as effective as a 2-tablet dose of combination oxycodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg in the treatment of moderate to severe postoperative obstetric or gynecologic pain. Both treatments were superior to placebo. The results of this study suggest that the combination of hydrocodone 7.5 mg and ibuprofen 200 mg may offer prescribers an additional option in combination pain therapy.",E,E

Observations were taken of treatment-related events with personnel (mostly nursing) time implications during the trial. Times were then associated with these events in an independent study of personnel activity. Costs were linked by using average wage rates for the various personnel for the Montreal area during the time of the study. Drug and material costs were hospital acquisition costs for all items. The cost of the PCA pump itself was not included in the analysis. Several analyses were performed to test the sensitivity of the results to various assumptions.; The results for total costs of the two therapies generally showed PCA to be more costly than regular i.m. injections despite no costs of the pump being included in the analyses. These results were robust with respect to changes in assumptions. Even when intentionally biasing the analysis against i.m. therapy, it was difficult to obtain results that favored PCA.; Based upon the institutions and assumptions in this analysis, PCA offers no cost advantages over regular i.m. therapy in the pain management after hysterectomy. Regular i.m. injections provided less costly analgesia.",E,E

Spinal anaesthesia was successful in most of the children, with only two patients being given general anaesthesia. Eighty-three percent of the children had pain at home and 19% had moderate or severe pain. Eighty-five percent of the children needed pain medication at home; the median dose of analgesics was 4 (1-9, 10th and 90th percentiles).

Among other reasons, this is due to suboptimal use of available analgesic drugs. In the past 2 years oral methadone has become our opioid of choice for severe pain in hospitalized children who can take oral medication. More than 70 babies and children, aged 8 months to 9 years, who suffered mainly from pain due to burns or cancer, were treated by the in-hospital pain service. They received 0.1% methadone syrup, 0.2-0.4 mg/kg/day, for from a few days to more than a month. In most there was significant pain relief with no serious side-effects. In some, treatment could be changed to parent-controlled analgesia after a few days, with no adverse effects. We describe 5 of the children who present the advantages of oral methadone over other opioids.",E,E

The authors therefore tested the hypothesis that intraoperative remifentanil administration results in acute opioid tolerance that is manifested by increased postoperative pain and opioid requirement.; Fifty adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to two anesthetic regimens: (1) desflurane was kept constant at 0.5 minimum alveolar concentrations and a remifentanil infusion was titrated to autonomic responses (remifentanil group); or (2) remifentanil at 0.1 microg. kg-1. min-1 and desflurane titrated to autonomic responses (desflurane group). All patients were given a bolus of 0.15 mg/kg morphine 40 min before the end of surgery. Morphine was initially titrated to need by postanesthesia care nurses blinded to group assignment. Subsequently, patients-who were also blinded to group assignment-controlled their own morphine administration. Pain scores and morphine consumption were recorded for 24 postoperative h.; The mean remifentanil infusion rate was 0.3 +/- 0.2 microg. kg-1. min-1 in the remifentanil group, which was significantly greater than in the desflurane group. Intraoperative hemodynamic responses were similar in each group. Postoperative pain scores were significantly greater in the remifentanil group. These patients required morphine significantly earlier than those in the desflurane group and needed nearly twice as much morphine in the first 24 postoperative h: 59 mg (25-75% interquartile range, 43-71) versus 32 mg (25-75% interquartile range, 19-59; P < 0.01).; Relatively large-dose intraoperative remifentanil increased postoperative pain and morphine consumption.

One limitation is the relatively short duration of effective analgesia produced by bupivicaine-fentanyl. In contrast, subarachnoid meperidine has been shown to provide a long duration of anesthesia in nonobstetric patients. Therefore, the authors tested the hypothesis that subarachnoid meperidine produces a significant increase in the duration of analgesia compared with bupivicaine-fentanyl.; Based on a power analysis of preliminary data, the authors intended to recruit 90 patients for the study, randomized to three groups: 2.5 mg bupivicaine-25 microg fentanyl, 15 mg meperidine, or 25 mg meperidine. However, after enrolling 34 patients, the study was discontinued because of a significant increase in nausea or vomiting in the study patients.; Nausea or vomiting was substantially increased in both meperidine groups compared with the bupivicaine-fentanyl group: 16 with nausea or vomiting in the meperidine groups (n = 21), compared with 1 in the bupivicaine-fentanyl group (n = 11), P = 0.0011. The mean duration of analgesia provided by 25 mg meperidine was 126 +/- 51 min, compared with 98 +/- 29 min for bupivicaine-fentanyl and 90 +/- 67 min for 15 mg meperidine. These data were not significant (P = 0.27).; Although intrathecal meperidine could potentially prolong subarachnoid analgesia during labor, its use was associated with a significant incidence of nausea or vomiting.

""on demand."" In spite of the availability of modern and more effective approaches for POPR, their utilization in hospitals in Israel is lagging. The aim of this project was to study how POPR is being performed in a randomly chosen academic gynecological department, with the assumption that increased awareness will facilitate the necessary changes needed to improve POPR. Four aspects of POPR were studied in 60 female subjects who underwent elective hysterectomy: patients' attitudes to postoperative pain and its relief ascertained prior to surgery; analgesics, prescribed and delivered; assessment of postoperative pain; and patients' satisfaction with POPR. Results show that patients' fear of postoperative pain is the largest component of their overall fear of the surgical procedure. Although they anticipate intense pain, and expect significant POPR, most women prefer not to receive opioid analgesics. Most patients received an average of 10-20 mg of morphine during the first 2 postoperative days. They reported at least moderate to severe pain on 5 of 6 measurements during that period. Nevertheless, most patients were satisfied with their POPR. It is likely that patients expressed a high level of satisfaction primarily due to their low-level of expectations. Assuming that these results represent the POPR situation nationwide, practical steps should be undertaken for its improvement.",E,E

The new patch form is indicated for the treatment of chronic cancer pain. (2) The clinical assessment mainly involved non comparative trials showing good analgesic efficacy on chronic pain. (3) Given the long time-lag before the effect of fentanyl is felt, a short-acting analgesic should be given when the first patch is applied.  Once adequate relief has been achieved the patch can be used alone to treat chronic pain.  It must be replaced every three days. (4) Fentanyl patches have similar adverse effects to opiate agonists, i.e. gastrointestinal and neuropsychological disorders.  However, the adverse effects of morphine and fentanyl are not always identical in a given patient. (5) Fentanyl patches carry a risk of misuse by opiate addicts and of acute intoxication.",3,E

A double blinded prospective trial in a convenience sample of patients >18 years of age presenting to an urban university hospital emergency department (ED) was conducted over a 19-month period. Patients were included if the pain was musculoskeletal in origin and was severe enough to warrant parenteral analgesics. Patients were randomized to receive 1 mg/kg meperidine intramuscularly (IM) or 60 mg ketorolac IM. Pain intensity was measured preadministration and at 60 minutes via a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Outcomes measured at 60 minutes were pain intensity decrease (PID), patient satisfaction, rescue analgesia requirement, sedation level, and adverse effects. Clinically significant pain reduction was defined as a PID of at least 13 mm or a reduction in pain of least 30%. One hundred fifty-five patients were enrolled (meperidine = 75, ketorolac = 80) and 153 patients completed the study. At 60 minutes the mean PID was 7 mm less in the ketorolac group (95% confidence interval [CI] - 15 mm to 2.6 mm). Pain reduction of at least 30% occurred in 63% of the ketorolac group versus 67% of the meperidine group (95% CI, odds ratio [OR] .43 to 1.61). Rescue analgesia was required in 35% of the ketorolac group versus 37% of the meperidine group (95% CI, OR .47 to 1.74). Patient satisfaction was less in the ketorolac group (ketorolac 68% satisfied versus meperidine 74% satisfied) however this was not significant (95% CI, OR .66 to 2.72). Sedation level and adverse effects were significantly greater in the meperidine group. Ketorolac shows comparable single dose analgesic efficacy to a single moderate dose of meperidine with less sedation and adverse effects in an ED population with severe musculoskeletal LBP. The trend for greater pain reduction and patient satisfaction with meperidine needs further investigation.",E,E

This clinical study assesses the potential peripheral analgesic effect of the combination of morphine and clonidine after intra-articular administration. Sixty patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists status I or II) undergoing arthroscopic repair of the knee during general anaesthesia were randomized to receive after operation, in a double-blind manner, either 1 mg morphine intra-articularly (group 1); 150 microg clonidine intra-articularly (group 2); or 1 mg morphine + 150 microg clonidine intra-articularly (group 3); or normal saline intra-articularly (group 4) in a volume of 30 mL, respectively. Visual analogue pain scores (VAS), duration of analgesia as defined by first demand for supplemental analgesics, subsequent 24 h consumption of postoperative supplementary analgesics, and patient satisfaction were evaluated. Co-administration of morphine + clonidine (group 3) resulted in a significant VAS reduction at 2 h after injection compared with the other groups. There was a tendency towards a lower need for supplementary rescue analgesia and towards a more prolonged analgesia in group 3 (211 min +/- 224 min SD) compared with group 1 (173 min +/- 197 min SD) and group 4 (91 min +/- 21 min SD). More patients were very satisfied with the postoperative analgesic regimen receiving the combination of morphine and clonidine (group 3) at 24 h postoperatively. Thus we conclude, that the peripheral co-delivery of an opioid and an a2-agonist will result in improved postoperative pain relief, when compared with each single agent given alone.",E,E

Knowledge of opioid pharmacology can help surgeons treat pain aggressively in patients while managing side effects and toxicities. This understanding can also address the unique problems in pain management presented in head and neck cancer patients attributable to the involvement by the disease of the aerodigestive tract, which interferes with the oral route of administration of opioid analgesics.

In order to answer this question, human acute pain studies, individual placebo-controlled studies for the treatment of specific chronic pain syndromes, and metaanalytic studies were reviewed and placed into table format. Analysis of this evidence led to the following conclusions: The evidence was consistent in indicating that overall antidepressants may have an antinociceptive effect in chronic pain, and that these drugs were effective for neuropathic pain. There was also some evidence that these drugs could be effective for psychogenic or somatoform disorder-associated pain. This evidence also strongly suggested that serotonergic-noradrenergic antidepressants may have a more consistent antinociceptive effect than the serotonergic antidepressants. Finally, this evidence indicated that antidepressants could be effective for pain associated with some specific pain syndromes, such as chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, fibrositis or fibromyalgia, and ulcer healing. Possible reasons for the conflicting results of studies in this area are presented, and problems that could limit the validity of the conclusions of this review are discussed.",E,E

Fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, can be administered percutaneously at a constant dose and is claimed to have fewer systemic side effects.; To evaluate transdermal fentanyl plaster versus sustained release morphine tablets as analgesic treatment of painful chronic pancreatitis.; In an open randomized crossover trial, 18 patients were included. The treatment period was 4 wk for each drug. All patients had immediate-release morphine tablets as rescue medication.; The dosage of transdermal fentanyl had to be increased on average 50% over that indicated by the manufacturer. When this was done and rescue medication was secured, no difference between the two drugs in primary endpoint or patient preference was observed. There was also no difference in the secondary endpoints, pain control, and quality of life. However, skin side effects, mostly mild, occurred in 44% of the patients during treatment with transdermal fentanyl, and the mean daily dose of immediate release morphine was significantly higher during the transdermal fentanyl period than during the sustained-release morphine period (30.7 mg vs. 14.7 mg [p < 0.01]).; When given in an appropriate dose, transdermal fentanyl might be useful for treatment of some patients with painful chronic pancreatitis, e.g., when tablet ingestion is difficult. However, the dosage often has to be increased above that recommended by the manufacturer. The need of rescue morphine is considerable and skin side effects often occur. Transdermal fentanyl is, therefore, not the ideal first-choice analgesic in patients with painful chronic pancreatitis.",I,E

Patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 received active MSC (30 mg) and placebo MSR, followed by placebo MSC and active MSR (30 mg) each for a period of 5 days. Group 2 started with active MSR and placebo MSC, followed by active MSC and placebo MSR, each for a period of 5 days. Blood for determination of plasma concentration of morphine (M) and its 3- and 6-glucuronides (M3G, M6G) was collected, and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)0-12 h, peak plasma concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (tmax), and CO and C12 of M, M6G and M3G were determined on day 5 and day 10.

A pronounced inter-patient variability in plasma concentrations of M, M3G and M6G was observed after administration of both forms. Apart from the C0 and C12, no significant differences in AUC0-12 h, tmax and Cmax of morphine between the rectal and oral route of administration were found. In the case of the metabolites, it was found that AUC0-12 h and Cmax of M6G, and AUC0-12 h, Cmax, C0 and C12 of M3G after rectal administration were significantly lower than after oral administration. However, apart from the tmax of M6G, none of the pharmacokinetic parameters of M, M6G or M3G met the criteria for bioequivalence. There were no significant (P = 0.44) differences in pain intensity score between the oral and rectal forms within the two groups, regardless of the treatment sequence. No treatment differences in nausea, sedation or the demand on escape medication (acetaminophen tablets) between the rectal and oral forms were observed.; The newly developed controlled-release M suppository is safe and effective and may be a useful alternative for oral morphine administration in patients with cancer pain.",E,E

The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy for pain control in patients with unresectable carcinoma of the pancreas.; Between May 1995 and April 1998, 24 patients (14 men and 10 women) with a mean age of 65 years (range, 30-85) suffering from intractable pain due to unresectable carcinoma of the pancreas underwent 35 thoracoscopic splanchnicectomies. All patients were opiate-dependent and unable to perform normal daily activities. Subjective evaluation of pain was measured before and after the procedure by a visual analogue score. The following parameters were also evaluated: procedure-related morbidity and mortality, operative time, and length of hospital stay.; All procedures were completed thoracoscopically, and no intraoperative complications occurred. The mean operative time was 58+/-22 min for unilateral left splanchnicectomy and 93.5+/-15.6 min for bilateral splanchnicectomies. The median value of preoperative pain intensity reported by patients on a visual analogue score was 8.5 (range, 8-10). Postoperatively, pain was totally relieved in all patients, as measured by reduced analgesic use. However, four patients experienced intercostal pain after bilateral procedures, even though their abdominal pain had disappeared. Complete pain relief until death was achieved in 20 patients (84%). Morbidity consisted of persistent pleural effusion in one patient and residual pneumothorax in another. The mean hospital stay was 3 days (range, 2-5).; We found thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy to be a safe and effective procedure of treating malignant intractable pancreatic pain. It eliminates the need for progressive doses of analgesics, with their side effects, and allows recovery of daily activity. The efficacy of this procedure is of major importance since life expectancy in these patients is very short.",E,E

Sixty women scheduled to undergo microvascular breast reconstruction under standard general anaesthesia were enrolled in a study on the performance of patient-controlled analgesia with tramadol or morphine with special emphasis on drug- and technique-related side-effects. Seven patients were re-operated within the same day, leaving 25 patients in the tramadol group and 28 in the morphine group for comparison. When postoperative pain occurred, loading doses of either 10 mg tramadol or 1 mg morphine intravenous increments were administered in a double-blind fashion until the pain control was judged to be satisfactory by the patient. After that the patients received tramadol or morphine by a PCA apparatus (lockout 5 min, tramadol 450 microg kg-1, morphine 45 microg kg-1 bolus). In addition, all patients received 500 mg paracetamol rectally, three times a day. The potency ratio of tramadol to morphine was found to be between 8.5 : 1 (loading) and 11 : 1 (PCA).

Women in the tramadol group had more nausea and vomiting during the administration of loading doses (P < 0.05) and more patients in the tramadol group (7) than in the morphine group (3) (NS) wanted to discontinue the PCA therapy before the end of the study due to nausea. Sedation or blurred vision prevented the performance of the psychomotor tests in 22 and 32% of the tramadol and morphine patients, respectively.

These patients were caught at inducing their symptoms. Factitious disorders may be more common and serious than expected. It is suggested to include this diagnosis routinely in the differential diagnosis when dealing with inexplicable complaints, symptoms or therapy resistance. If factitious disorders are diagnosed it is advised to confront the patients. This is important in order to limit further iatrogenic damage to the patient. It also allows the physician to inform other doctors. After confrontation quite a few patients will stop inducing their symptoms. Most of them become angry, deny self-induction and refuse psychiatric help. Sometimes patients will withdraw from treatment. Despite these negative reactions patient confrontation is mandatory.",E,E

There is no scientific basis for such a measure, however. On the contrary, current evidence indicates that e.g. cancer patients using 209 mg morphine daily for three months do not differ significantly from a control group with respect to thinking abilities, alertness, concentration, reaction speed and dividing attention. For obvious reasons utmost care must be observed with the use of morphine by traffic participants.

Previous studies with this combination have demonstrated that the components have an additive analgesic effect as well as efficacy compared with other fixed-dose combination analgesics.; This randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, single-dose, placebo-controlled study compared 1 tablet of hydrocodone 7.5 mg with ibuprofen 200 mg (n = 60), 2 tablets of hydrocodone 7.5 mg with ibuprofen 200 mg (n = 60), and placebo (n = 60) in patients with moderate or severe pain after abdominal or gynecologic surgery. Analgesia was evaluated over 8 hours.; Mean pain relief (PR) scores were significantly greater for the 2-tablet dose than for the 1-tablet dose at 80 (P = 0.027) and 100 (P = 0.017) minutes and at 2 (P = 0.013), 2.5 (P = 0.012), 3 (P = 0.006), 4 (P = 0.029), 5 (P = 0.002), 6 (P = 0.032), 7 (P = 0.036), and 8 (P = 0.01) hours.

Mean sum of pain intensity differences was significantly greater for the 2-tablet dose than for the 1-tablet dose for all measured time intervals (0 to 3 hours, P = 0.004; 0 to 4 hours, P < 0.001; 0 to 6 hours, P < 0.001; 0 to 8 hours, P < 0.001). Mean peak PR score and median time-to-remedication were significantly greater for the 2-tablet dose than for the 1-tablet dose (P < 0.029 and P = 0.017, respectively). Both doses were superior to placebo. There were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing adverse events between the 2-tablet dose (n = 6 [10.0%]), the 1-tablet dose (n = 4 [6.7%]), and placebo (n = 1 11.7%]).

The aim of this prospective randomised study is to test whether or not different kinds of epidural analgesia (Group A: morphine 0.0017 mg/kg/h and bupivacaine 0.125%-0.058 mg/kg/h; Group B: morphine alone 0.035 mg/kg/12h in the postoperative period) allow earlier postoperative enteral feeding, enhance intestinal motility a passage of flatus and help avoid complications, such as nausea, vomiting, ileus, diarrhoea, pneumonia or other infective diseases. We included in the study 60 patients (28 males and 32 females) with a mean age of 61.2 years (range 50-70) and with an ASA score of 2 or 3. All patients had hepato-biliary-pancreatic neoplasm and were candidates for major surgery. We compared two different pharmacological approaches, i.e., morphine plus bupivacaine (30 patients, Group A) versus morphine alone (30 patients, Group B). Each medication was administered by means of a thoracic epidural catheter for the control of postoperative pain. In the postoperative course we recorded every 6 hours peristaltic activity. We also noted morbidity (pneumonia, wound sepsis) and mortality. Effective peristalsis was present in all patients in Group A within the first six postoperative hours; in Group B, after 30 hours. Six patients in Group A had bowel motions in the first postoperative day, 11 in the second day, 10 in the third day and 3 in fourth day, while in Group B none in the first day, two in the second, 7 in the third, 15 in the fourth, and 6 in the fifth: the difference between the two groups was significant (p<0.05 in 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th days). Pneumonia occurred in 2 patients of Group A, and in 10 of Group B (p < 0.05). We conclude that epidural analgesia with morphine plus bupivacaine allowed a move rapid return to normal gut activity and early enteral nutrition compared with epidural analgesia with morphine alone.",E,E

However, this opioid has some side effects such as pruritus, and in higher doses could harm the neonate. The purpose of this study was to compare three doses of sufentanil combined with low-dose bupivacaine, to determine the lowest appropriate dose.; In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, 243 parturients were randomized, to receive A--0.5 microg/ml, or B--0.75 microg/ml or C--1 microg/ml sufentanil, in addition to bupivacaine 0.625 mg/ml+adrenaline 1.25 microg/ml. All were given an 8 ml bolus of the study solution, followed by continuous infusion at 6 ml/h. The analgetic effect was scored on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Onset quality was measured as VAS after 20 min, the total effect as VAS maximum during the first stage of labour. Overall maternal satisfaction was recorded within two hours post partum. Side effects were noted.; There were no differences between groups in VAS assessments after 20 min or in maximum registered VAS. In group A, 83% had VAS 0-4 after 20 min, in group B 77% and in group C 71%. Maximum VAS during the first stage was 0-4 for 60% of group A, 68% of group B and 61% of group C. Maternal satisfaction was also the same in the three groups. In group A, 70% reported excellent effect and 22% good effect. The corresponding figures in group B were 68% and 24% respectively, and in group C 62% and 24% respectively. Group A received a mean total dose of 21 microg sufentanil, group B 30 microg and group C 44 microg. Pruritus occurred in 51% of group A, 53% of group B and 65% of group C.; We found no difference in the analgesic effect between three different concentrations of sufentanil. We conclude that the lowest dose may be used. This should decrease the risk of adverse effects on mother and child.",E,E

An analysis of this phenomenon suggests that it may be mediated, at least in part, by up-regulation of the 'endogenous analgesia system' (EAS), a neural pathway that projects caudally from medullary nuclei to the dorsal horn of the spinal column; when stimulated by chronic pain or therapeutic measures such as opiates or acupuncture, the EAS suppresses activation of second-order pain-receptive neurons in the dorsal horn, and thereby alleviates pain. Since serotonin and enkephalins are key neurotransmitters in the EAS, it is reasonable to predict that measures which promote serotonin activity (such as 5-hydroxytryptophan and serotonin-reuptake inhibitors) as well as enkephalin activity (such as D-phenylalanine, an enkephalinase inhibitor) should potentiate EAS-mediated analgesia - a view consistent with much previous medical research. Comprehensive support of the EAS with well-tolerated nutrients and pharmaceuticals may amplify the analgesic efficacy of chronic opiate therapy, while enabling dosage reductions that minimize opiate side-effects. Analogously, this approach may complement the efficacy of acupuncture and other analgesic measures that activate the EAS.",E,E

It is widely used, and administered in various ways for the control of acute and chronic pain states. There are, however, certain types of pain and certain clinical conditions in which morphine cannot be used due to the risk of possible complications. These are usually pain states associated with intracranial hypertension, the presence of serious respiratory problems, the onset of major opioid tolerance, persistent vomiting, and so on. The search for ""alternative analgesics"" has been in progress for a decade, alternatives that could be used alone or in combination for spinal administration in the treatment of complex chronic pain states and with a low incidence of secondary effects. Today, research is carefully assessing the clinical effectiveness and the side effects of a series of drugs for spinal administration, that is, epidural or intrathecal, such as the new narcotics, alpha-2 agonists, central muscle relaxants, calcitonin, and local anesthetics. In this alternative analgesic category we have to mention the somatotrophin-release inhibiting factor (SRIF), which is an ubiquitous native hormone with widespread, predominantly inhibitory actions, and octreotide, its synthetic analogue. In this article we review the literature on the natural drug and its synthetic analogue, paying particular attention to the problems connected with intraspinal administration and analgesic properties.",E,E

This approach is time-consuming and has never been validated in a prospective trial. The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of titration, as outlined in practice guidelines, with a single, rapid bolus of sedatives before colonoscopy.; Consecutive colonoscopy outpatients were randomized to a single, rapid bolus of meperidine and midazolam or to a titration of doses every 3 min until predefined levels of somnolence were achieved. The colonoscopist was not present during sedation and remained blinded as to which technique was used. Supplemental O2 was given for SaO2 <90% on three or more occasions. Total physician time was calculated from the first injection of sedatives to the removal of the colonoscope. Patient assessments of pain and tolerance were obtained at the time of discharge using visual analog scales of 100 mm (0 = excellent and 100 = unbearable).; A total of 101 patients were randomized (49 bolus, 52 titration). Demographic features were similar for both groups. Titration required more physician time than did bolus (32.2 min vs 20.1 min, p < 0.001) and was associated with an increased need for supplemental O2 (44% vs 14%, p = 0.002). Mean tolerance scores were similar (titration 16.3 vs bolus 15.3, p = 0.72).; Rapid bolus sedation for colonoscopy saves significant endoscopist time, is associated with less O2 desaturation, and provides equivalent levels of patient comfort. A revision of the guidelines for sedation and analgesia during endoscopy should be considered.",E,E

Side effects generally are tolerable, and treatment can be maintained with stable doses for long periods. Problems with addiction are infrequent. Many physicians, however, assume that opioids should be used only for chronic malignant pain. Research and clinical experience have demonstrated that opioids can safely and effectively relieve most chronic moderate to severe nonmalignant pain. Fears of addiction, disciplinary action, and adverse effects result in ineffective pain management. With current information on the use of opioids in chronic nonmalignant pain, primary care physicians can overcome these obstacles. Guidelines must clearly define the role of the primary care physician in the proper management of pain and the integration of opioid therapy. Used appropriately, opioids may represent the only source of relief for many patients.",E,E

Patients were evaluated for intra-operative oculocardiac reflex, peri-operative pain relief, recovery from anaesthesia and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Apart from significantly reducing the incidence of oculocardiac reflex (30% vs. 70%, p = 0.0019), peribulbar bupivacaine also attenuated the severity of the reflex. Postoperative pain relief was superior in the block group.

Intrathecal ziconotide has been recommended for approval by the FDA for the management of chronic pain. Spinally administered ziconotide produces analgesia by blocking neurotransmitter release from primary nociceptive afferents and prevents the propagation of pain signals to the brain. It has an advantage over intrathecal morphine in that there is no development of tolerance after prolonged use. Systemic toxicity is considerably reduced by administration of smaller doses intrathecally and selective delivery to the site of action in the nervous system. Nevertheless, there are neurological adverse effects due to delay in clearance of ziconotide from the neural tissues. Overall, ziconotide has a favourable risk/benefit ratio with advantages over several currently available intrathecal therapies for pain.",E,E

The patient had presented with severe left upper quadrant (LUQ) pain following blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) sustained during a sledding accident. A screening bedside focused abdominal sonogram for trauma (FAST) rapidly excluded free fluid on two serial examinations, 30 minutes apart. It provided the pediatric emergency physician with a measure of diagnostic confidence that the patient could be safely transported to the CT suite for detailed delineation of his injury. Moreover, narcotic analgesia was liberally administered early in his illness course, without the fear of unmasking potential hypovolemia when it was known that he did not have gross intra-abdominal bleeding on his bedside ultrasound (US). It also provided a working diagnosis of the primary organ of injury. Our hospital, like many pediatric hospitals around the nation, does not have in-house 24-hour radiology support. We suggest that the use of the bedside US be extended to the stable pediatric patient in severe abdominal pain following BAT. It can serve as a valuable, rapid, noninvasive, bedside, easily repeated, fairly accurate triage tool to evaluate pediatric BAT with severe pain.",E,E

They need to be treated for relief of symptoms, including pain. Undertreatment or inadequate treatment of pain for these individuals is a particular problem because of opioid dependency and/or methadone maintenance treatment. The guiding principles governing treatment of these patients are to maintain the methadone treatment and to use short-acting narcotics administered at higher doses, and to do so as often as necessary, preferably on a fixed schedule, to relieve the pain. Supplemental analgesic medication may also be employed, except that opiate antagonists must be avoided.",E,E

If analgesics act differently on cutaneous and deep nociception, the results of these studies may not be entirely applicable to clinical pain involving deep structures. We tested the hypothesis that opioids have different abilities to inhibit cutaneous and muscular pain. Either the opioid remifentanil or placebo was infused in 12 healthy volunteers in a cross-over fashion. Repeated electrical stimulation (five impulses at 2 Hz) was applied to both skin and muscle. Pain thresholds were recorded. Remifentanil caused a higher increase in the muscular pain thresholds than in the cutaneous pain thresholds (P = 0.035). We conclude that opioids inhibit muscular pain more strongly than cutaneous pain in humans.",E,E

Data from analgesic studies are often difficult to interpret because the clinical importance of the results is not obvious. Differences between groups, as summarized by a change in mean values over time, can be difficult to apply to clinical care. Baseline scores vary widely and group mean differences could reflect large changes in a few patients, small changes in many patients, or any combination of these outcomes. Determination of the proportion of patients who have a clinically important improvement in their pain would provide a more interpretable result with direct clinical implications. However, determining a clinically important outcome requires information about the degree of change over time that is clinically important. Data from the titration phase of a multiple cross-over randomized clinical trial of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) for the treatment of cancer-related breakthrough pain were re-analyzed to examine the differences in pain scores between treatment episodes that did and did not yield adequate pain relief. The scales evaluated were absolute pain intensity difference (PID, 0-10 scale), percentage pain intensity difference (PID%, 0-100% scale), pain relief (PR, 0 (none), 1 (slight), 2 (moderate), 3 (lots), 4 (complete)), sum of the pain intensity difference (SPID over 60 min), percentage of maximum total pain relief (% Max TOTPAR over 60 min), and global medication performance (0 (poor), 1 (fair), 2 (good), 3 (very good), 4 (excellent)). Adequate relief was defined by the patient's decision not to use another dose of opioid medication as a rescue, in addition to the study medication, to treat each painful episode. One hundred thirty OTFC naive patients contributed data on 1268 episodes of breakthrough pain. The scales that were converted to a percentage change yielded the best accuracy in predicting adequate relief, with balanced sensitivity and specificity. The best cut-off point for both the % Max TOTPAR and the PID% was 33%. The best cut-off points for the absolute scales were absolute pain intensity difference of 2, pain relief of 2 (moderate), and SPID of 2. The global medication performance of 2 (good) had excellent values as well. This study presents data-derived cut-off points for the changes in several pain scales, each reflecting the clinically important improvement for patients treating breakthrough cancer pain episodes with OTFC. Confirmation in other patient populations and different pain syndromes will be needed. The use of consistent clinically important cut-off points as the primary outcome in future pain therapy clinical trials will enhance their validity, comparability, and clinical applicability.",E,E

Aiming to further reduce the associated motor weakness, we investigated the use of alfentanil alone as the initial intrathecal injection in a double-blind study. Thirty women were randomly allocated to receive either alfentanil 0.25 mg with bupivacaine 2.5 mg intrathecally, or alfentanil 0.25 mg in the same volume. Onset of analgesia did not differ significantly between groups but duration was significantly longer in those receiving alfentanil-bupivacaine (mean 55 min vs. 40 min; p < 0.05). Quality of analgesia was satisfactory for all women, although the cumulative analgesia scores were significantly lower in the women receiving the alfentanil-bupivacaine mixture (p = 0.003). More women in the alfentanil-bupivacaine group developed both a sensory level (15/15 vs. 6/15; p < 0.01) and sympathetic block (12/15 vs. 4/15; p < 0.01). Sixty per cent of women receiving the alfentanil-bupivacaine mixture demonstrated an impaired ability to straight leg raise compared with none of the women in the alfentanil-saline group (p < 0.01). The incidence of adverse effects in mother and fetus was similar in both groups. We conclude that intrathecal alfentanil 0.25 mg alone as part of a CSE technique provides rapid analgesia of satisfactory quality without detectable motor blockade.",E,E

Laboratory data showed thrombocythaemia and a positive antibody to the acetylcholine receptor, but were negative for antinuclear and antiphospholipid antibodies. A diagnosis of secondary erythermalgia was made because of the clinical features, the laboratory data, and the lack of family history of this disease. Although steroid pulse therapy, oral aspirin and antiserotonin drugs were ineffective, bilateral lumbar sympathetic ganglion block succeeded in relieving the severe pain and curing the ulcers. The clinical course in our patient suggests that sympathetic ganglion block may be one of the most effective treatments for secondary erythermalgia.

Many patients are referred to late in the disease course. This conservative method to control pain of malignant origin must not be reserved for last resort treatment for terminal patients. Intra-cerebro-ventricular morphine administration is a very effective and generally safe method for controlling intractable cancer pain. Because of the chronic implantation of an intra-ventricular catheter this method is somewhat invasive. Its indications remain a simple and effective alternative when the topography of nociceptive pain is diffuse or cephalic. In clinical practice, intrathecal and/or intra-cerebro-ventricular administration of opioids is limited by cost, the need for specialized maintenance and mechanical malfunctions if implantable drug delivery systems, or by the risk of bacterial contamination and ambulatory constraints when repeated daily injections via an intrathecal access port are used. To answer these limitations, cell therapy using intrathecal chromaffin cell allograft is a promising approach for the management of cancer pain refractory to traditional drug therapy and pain lesion surgery. The basic rationale and preclinical studies on experimental pain models have enabled starting prospective clinical trials. Prior to transplantation, handling and preparation of the chromaffin tissue is critical for allograft viability. The initial results of clinical trials with human chromaffin cell grafts from intractable cancer pain have reported long-lasting pain relief, in correlation with met-enkephalin release into the CSF. Convincing evidence will require controlled studies. The limitations of this innovative cell therapy and especially the lack of human adrenal gland availability point to the need for new sources of cells. Perspectives include xenogenic or engineered cell lines.",E,E

In vivo (1)H-MRS was used to measure relative concentrations of N-acetyl aspartate, creatine, choline, glutamate, glutamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, inositol, glucose and lactate in relation to the concentration of creatine. These measurements were performed in six brain regions of nine chronic low back pain patients and 11 normal volunteers. All chronic back pain subjects underwent clinical evaluation and perceptual measures of pain and anxiety. We show that chronic back pain alters the human brain chemistry. Reductions of N-acetyl aspartate and glucose were demonstrated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Cingulate, sensorimotor, and other brain regions showed no chemical concentration differences. In chronic back pain, the interrelationship between chemicals within and across brain regions was abnormal, and there was a specific relationship between regional chemicals and perceptual measures of pain and anxiety. These findings provide direct evidence of abnormal brain chemistry in chronic back pain, which may be useful in diagnosis and future development of more effective pharmacological treatments.",E,E

The aim of this study was to assess pain management behavior of physicians and nurses, and to evaluate the effects of a Pain Monitoring Program for nurses on the extent to which nurses administer analgesics. The Pain Monitoring Program consisted of two components: educating nurses about pain, pain assessment and pain management; and implementing daily pain assessment by means of a numeric rating scale. Several outcomes were distinguished to evaluate the administration of analgesics by nurses: the prescribed analgesics by physicians, the administered analgesics by nurses, and the discrepancy between the ordered and the administered analgesics. The effects of the Pain Monitoring Program on these outcomes were measured in a quasi-experimental design with a non-equivalent control group. In total, 703 patients participated: 358 patients in the control group and 345 in the intervention group. Patients were interviewed twice, i.e. at the beginning and at the end of hospitalization. Results of the control group showed that at the first interview 70% of the patients were prescribed analgesics by physicians and only 74% of those patients were actually administered analgesics by nurses. Consequently, 50% of the patients in pain received analgesics. The administered analgesics was in absolute agreement with the prescribed analgesics in 60% of the patients with routine analgesics and in 85% of the patients with PRN analgesics. The relative difference between ordered and administered routine analgesics was small, namely 15% for opioids and 20% for non-opioids. Similar results of the control group were found for the second interview. In addition, the results showed that the Pain Monitoring Program was effective in improving nurses' administration of analgesics. At the first interview more patients received analgesics that were prescribed on a PRN basis and the doses of administered routine non-opioids including PRN increased. At the time of the second interview, more patients received weak opioids. The Pain Monitoring Program was especially effective in patients with moderate to severe pain. However, the discrepancy between the analgesics ordered by physicians and actually administered by nurses did not change as a result of the Pain Monitoring Program. Based on this study it can be concluded that the use of a simple method such as a numeric rating scale together with pain education for nurses is effective in improving the administration of analgesics by nurses. These are important results because nurses play an essential role in helping patients to cope with their pain. Because the Pain Monitoring Program (PMP) was effective in a heterogeneous population in multiple care settings, the possibility of implementing the PMP in routine nursing practice should be considered.",E,E

It occurs in approximately 50% of patients after thoracotomy and is usually mild or moderate. However, in 5% the pain is severe and disabling. No one technique of thoracotomy has been shown to reduce the incidence of chronic postthoracotomy pain. The most likely cause is intercostal nerve damage, although the precise mechanism for this is not known. Future work needs to examine surgical technique in detail. Until then, patients need to be adequately warned of this sequela of thoracotomy.",E,E

Their pain and vomiting were assessed using a simple 4-point score in the Recovery Unit by the nursing staff, and at home by the parents. There were no significant differences in pain or vomiting scores between the two groups in the immediate postoperative period. However, children having orchidopexy experienced more pain at home during the first night and the following day than those having herniotomy. Nearly one-third of the former group had moderate to severe pain at home, in contrast to less than one-tenth of children having herniotomy, who are also more likely to be painfree on the next day. We concluded that children having herniotomy can be treated adequately at home with paracetamol alone, whereas children having orchidopexy may require supplementation with stronger analgesics.",E,E

Infusion doses were calculated as half the daily pre-operative dose of oral morphine with the increments as one-sixth of the infusion dose. Results were recorded on the first two postoperative days before (n = 13) and after (n = 23) commencing the new regimen. The percentage of patients reporting severe pain at rest and on movement were significantly reduced by the new regimen (54% and 69% vs. 13% and 40%, respectively) since the opioid dose as a percentage of the pre-operative dose was significantly higher (160% vs. 352%). There were no instances of excessive sedation or slow respiratory rate in any patient. The use of the regimen has resulted in greater doses of opioids being administered with fewer patients in severe pain without significant complications.",E,E

The extensive surgical procedure with multilevel laminectomies and the nerve root manipulation result in intense pain postoperatively. Two intrathecal (IT) regimes of pain treatment were compared in these children, concerning their pain relief and possible side-effects. In a prospective study, 12 children (3-6 years of age) with six in each group, received either intermittent IT morphine (5 microg x kg(-1) four times a day) or continuous infusion of a mixture of bupivacaine (40 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) and morphine (0.6 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)). Pain score was lower in the bupivacaine/morphine group (0.2 +/- 1.1) compared to intermittent morphine (2 +/- 2.4) on a scale from 0 to 6 (P less than or = 0.0001). Bupivacaine/morphine resulted in a lower, but not significant, difference in pruritus and lower muscle spasm. Haemodynamic and ventilatory parameters did not differ between the groups.

Postoperatively, time to first eye opening, sedation score, pain score, time for further analgesia requests and incidence of nausea and vomiting were recorded. There was no statistical significant difference in any of these parameters between the two groups. The results suggest that sublingual morphine may be a suitable alternative to various other routes of opioid administration in children, but further investigations of the sublingual route of administration of opioids in children are required.",E,E

Five out of 23 patients who had intrathecal infusions of opiates for longer than 24 months developed leg and feet edema. As predisposing factors, cardiovascular disease, deep venous thrombosis, peripheral vascular disease, and venous stasis of the lower extremities were considered. Every patient who developed pedal and leg edema after the implantation of an infusion pump was also found to have leg edema and venous stasis prior to the time when the pump was inserted. This complication was severe enough to limit their physical activity, and to produce lymphedema, ulcerations and hyperpigmentation of the skin. Reduction of the edema occurred when the dose of the opiate was decreased, and in two cases in which the infusion was discontinued, there was almost complete resolution of the syndrome. It appears that the pre-existence of pedal edema and of venous stasis is a relative contraindication to the long-term intrathecal infusion of opiates in patients with chronic non-cancer pain.",E,E

Our knowledge about the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain has grown significantly over last 2 decades. Basic research with animal and human models of neuropathic pain has shown that a number of pathophysiological and biochemical changes take place in the nervous system as a result of an insult. This property of the nervous system to adapt morphologically and functionally to external stimuli is known as neuroplasticity and plays a crucial role in the onset and maintenance of pain symptoms. Many similarities between the pathophysiological phenomena observed in some epilepsy models and in neuropathic pain models justify the rational for use of anticonvulsant drugs in the symptomatic management of neuropathic pain disorders. Carbamazepine, the first anticonvulsant studied in clinical trials, probably alleviates pain by decreasing conductance in Na+ channels and inhibiting ectopic discharges. Results from clinical trials have been positive in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. The availability of newer anticonvulsants tested in higher quality clinical trials has marked a new era in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Gabapentin has the most clearly demonstrated analgesic effect for the treatment of neuropathic pain, specifically for treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. Based on the positive results of these studies and its favourable adverse effect profile, gabapentin should be considered the first choice of therapy for neuropathic pain. Evidence for the efficacy of phenytoin as an antinociceptive agent is, at best, weak to modest. Lamotrigine has good potential to modulate and control neuropathic pain, as shown in 2 controlled clinical trials, although another randomised trial showed no effect. There is potential for phenobarbital, clonazepam, valproic acid, topiramate, pregabalin and tiagabine to have antihyperalgesic and antinociceptive activities based on result in animal models of neuropathic pain, but the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of human neuropathic pain has not yet been fully determined in clinical trials. The role of anticonvulsant drugs in the treatment of neuropathic pain is evolving and has been clearly demonstrated with gabapentin and carbamazepine. Further advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain syndromes and well-designed clinical trials should further the opportunities to establish the role of anticonvulsants in the treatment of neuropathic pain.",E,E

Parturients received the study drug as the intrathecal injection of the combined spinal-epidural (CSE) technique for labour analgesia. Duration and degree of analgesia were measured until epidural analgesia was initiated or delivery of the baby. The intensity and distribution (above T6, T6-L1, and below L1) of pruritus were measured at five minute intervals during first 25 min after injection.; Quality and duration of analgesia did not differ between groups, but the overall incidence of pruritus was less in the Dex group (88% vs 42%, P = 0.001). Within each region, the incidence of pruritus was less in the Dex group. In patients who had pruritus, for the Dex group, the incidence of pruritus in the upper region (>T6) was lower than the NS group.

However, NSAIDs have not been used extensively in cardiac surgical patients due to the fear of untoward effects on gastric, renal, and coagulation parameters. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of three NSAIDs for pain control in CABG patients.; One hundred and twenty patients scheduled for elective CABG surgery were enrolled in randomized, double blind, controlled study. Standardized fast track cardiac anesthesia was used. One dose of drug (75 mg diclofenac, 100 mg ketoprofen, 100 mg indomethacin, or placebo) was given pr one hour before tracheal extubation and a second dose 12 hr later. Pain was treated with morphine iv and acetaminophen po. Visual analogue pain scores were recorded at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hr after the first dose of drug.; There were no differences among the groups in pain scores. Only patients who received diclofenac required less morphine than patients in the control group (P < 0.05). When the total amounts of pain medications were computed to morphine equivalents, only patients in the diclofenac group received less pain medications than the placebo group (P < 0.05). Proportion of patients with postoperative increase of creatinine level (20% and over) did not differ between placebo and drug groups.; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used for analgesia management post CABG surgery in selected patients.

Longitudinal monitoring mechanisms were established to audit medical records and survey patients to examine both staff practice patterns and patient outcomes. The QI team targeted use of meperidine, one of the most widely used opioid analgesics for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, which is now discouraged as a first-line agent for most painful conditions.; A QI process was implemented using a traditional plan-do-check-act (PDCA) model, resulting in a successful and sustained reduction of inappropriate meperidine use. A cause-and-effect diagram helped highlight the multiple factors contributing to the drug's overuse and was used to prioritize targets for action. A flow chart helped to uncover some of the interrelationships between the myths about meperidine and the resultant customary prescribing and administration practices. While most of the strategies were implemented in 1996 (formulary guideline release, change in stock supply and physician orders, staff education and feedback), a significant impact in practice was not seen until late 1997. Ongoing tracking and feedback loops were established to ensure continued low use of meperidine.; Use of a QI approach in pain management has been shown to affect the visibility of pain as a clinical priority, enhance interdisciplinary collaboration, facilitate the implementation of clinical guidelines at the bedside, and improve the quality of care for patients.",E,E

The pharmacokinetics of nortilidine and naloxone were studied in 18 male healthy subjects after oral application of tilidine/naloxone solution or tilidine/naloxone retard tablets, respectively. The following report gives the results on investigations of a) dose linearity after application of 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg Valoron N solution, b) dose equivalence of Valoron N solution (4 x 50 mg tilidine) and Valoron N retard tablets (2 x 100 mg tilidine) under steady state conditions, and c) the equivalence of different dose strengths of Valoron N retard tablets (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg tilidine/tablet). The results obtained in these studies demonstrate a dose linear kinetic for nortilidine after the application of 25 mg to 100 mg tilidine. Furthermore, there is dose equivalence between the tilidine/naloxone solution and tilidine/naloxone retard tablets, which permits the replacing of the solution with the retard tablets. Because of the equivalence of different dose strengths of Valoron N tablets, patients are able to exchange low dosed Valoron N retard tablets for higher-dosed ones (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg tilidine/tablet), if necessary. With their constant release of tilidine and the possibility for individual dosage, the retard tablets are efficient analgesics that improve pain therapy considerably for patients with chronic pain.",E,E

Postoperative agitation, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) scores, and satisfaction of PACU nurses and parents with the anesthetic technique were evaluated.; In phase 1, the mean fentanyl concentrations at 10 +/- 4 min (mean +/- SD) and 34 +/- 9 min after administering intranasal fentanyl were 0.80 +/- 0.28 and 0.64 +/- 0.25 ng/ml, respectively. In phase 2, the incidence of severe agitation, highest CHEOPS scores, and heart rate in the PACU were decreased with intranasal fentanyl. There were no differences between sevoflurane and halothane in these measures and in times to hospital discharge. The incidence of postoperative vomiting, hypoxemia, and slow respiratory rates were not increased with fentanyl.; Serum fentanyl concentrations after intranasal administration exceed the minimum effective steady state concentration for analgesia in adults. The use of intranasal fentanyl during halothane or sevoflurane anesthesia for BMT is associated with diminished postoperative agitation without an increase in vomiting, hypoxemia, or discharge times.",E,E

The purpose of this prospective, double-blind study was to examine the influence of the surgical method for correction of squint on the incidence of postoperative vomiting.; One hundred and twenty consecutive children aged 2-12 years, scheduled for elective strabismus surgery, were enrolled in this prospective, double-blind study. A standardised total intravenous anaesthesia was given to all children. The development of perioperative oculocardiac reflex was noted and the number of episodes of vomiting during the first 48 h postoperatively was recorded. At the completion of the study, the children who were operated with myopexy according to Faden, were allocated to a Faden group, those without a myopexy to the non-Faden group. All the patients included in this study were operated on by the same surgeon with standardised techniques.; The Faden group was younger, lighter and the operation time was longer (P<0.05). The incidence of vomiting was greater in the Faden group; 53% versus 12% (P<0.05). The incidence of oculocardiac reflex was similar in both groups; 40% in the Faden versus 28% in the non-Faden group, respectively. The total dose of propofol and alfentanil was similar between the groups. Requirement of analgesics for postoperative pain was similar in both groups. The only independent risk factor for postoperative vomiting was the Faden operation.; The surgical method used for strabismus correction in children has a great influence on the incidence of postoperative vomiting. The Faden operation is associated with a very high incidence of postoperative vomiting; this particular group of patients has to be considered as a high risk group for postoperative vomiting and deserves an antiemetic prophylaxis.",E,E

Two counterbalanced treatment phases of 4 weeks each were initiated with an intravenous test infusion of MST or Placebo. The titration phase was 2 weeks. The dose of MST was titrated to at least 70 mg/day and at highest 300 mg/day. Pain intensity was assessed hourly on visual analog scales during a 4-week treatment-free phase, both treatment phases and at two follow-ups (6 and 12 months). Reorganization of somatosensory cortex, electric perception and pain thresholds as well as selective attention were measured pre- and post-treatment. A significant pain reduction was found during MST but not during placebo. A clinically relevant response to MST (pain reduction of more than 50%) was evident in 42%, a partial response (pain reduction of 25-50%) in 8% of the patients. Neuromagnetic source imaging of three patients showed initial evidence for reduced cortical reorganization under MST concurrent with the reduction in pain intensity. Perception and pain thresholds were not significantly altered whereas attention was significantly lower under MST. Thus, opioids show efficacy in the treatment of phantom limb pain and may potentially influence also cortical reorganization. These data need to be replicated in larger patient samples.",I,I

Previous studies on pain sensitivity in methadone maintenance patients have yielded contradictory results. This study compared nociceptive responses between 16 patients on stable, once daily, doses of methadone and 16 matched control subjects. Two types of nociceptive stimuli were used: (1) electrical stimulation; and (2) a cold pressor test. Two parameters were measured: detection for onset of pain, and pain tolerance. Methadone patients were tested over an inter-dosing period: at the time of trough plasma methadone concentration (0 h), and 3 h after their daily dose. Control subjects were tested twice 3 h apart. Blood samples were collected to determine plasma methadone concentration. In methadone patients, trough to peak increases in mean R-(-)- and S-(+)-methadone concentrations (118 and 138 ng/ml to 185 and 259 ng/ml, respectively) resulted in significant increases in pain detection and tolerance values for both nociceptive stimuli. Using electrical stimulation, methadone patients' pain tolerance values were lower than controls at 0 h, but higher than controls at 3 h; no significant differences in pain detection values were found. For the cold pressor test, methadone patients detected pain significantly earlier than controls at 0 h, and were also substantially less pain tolerant than controls at both 0 and 3 h. There were no significant differences in pain detection values between the two groups at 3 h. Pain tolerance to pain detection ratios for methadone patients were significantly lower than controls for the cold pressor test at 0 and 3 h, and for electrical stimulation at 0 h only. In summary, the relative pain sensitivity of methadone maintenance patients is determined by the nature of the nociceptive stimulus (e.g. cold pressor test versus electrical stimulation), the plasma methadone concentration (trough versus peak plasma concentration), and whether thresholds are determined for detection of pain or pain tolerance. Although responding to changes in plasma methadone concentration, maintenance patients are markedly hyperalgesic to pain induced by the cold pressor test.",E,E

Patients with only mild pain when coughing during thoracic epidural infusion of about 10 ml per hour of bupivacaine 1 mg x ml(-1), fentanyl 2 microg x ml(-1), and adrenaline 2 microg x ml(-1) were included. On the 1st and 2nd postoperative days, each patient was given a double-blind epidural infusion, at the same rate, with or without fentanyl. The effects were observed for 6 h or until pain when coughing became unacceptable in spite of rescue analgesia. Rescue analgesia consisted of up to two patient-controlled epidural bolus injections (4 ml) per hour and intravenous morphine if necessary.; Main outcome measures, i.e. pain intensity when coughing and at rest, increased (P<0.001) when fentanyl (19.2+/-5.2 microg x h(-1)) was omitted from the epidural infusion: after 6 h pain intensity when coughing had increased to unacceptable levels in spite of increased consumption of rescue bupivacaine and adrenaline (P<0.001). Within 15-20 min after restarting the triple epidural mixture with fentanyl, pain intensity was again reduced to mild pain when coughing.; A low dose of epidural fentanyl (20 microg x h(-1)) markedly improved the pain-relieving effect of bupivacaine and adrenaline infused epidurally at a thoracic level after major upper abdominal surgery. This dose of fentanyl is much too small to relieve severe dynamic pain when given systemically. Therefore, this study indirectly supports the view that a low-dose thoracic epidural infusion of fentanyl has a spinal analgesic site of action.",E,E

A review was done of the literature using Medline and other search techniques. New pain scales have been developed with seniors in mind and greater testing of older scales in elderly populations have helped to identify measures of pain more suited to frail seniors. Advances in cyclooxygenase inhibition selectivity, alternative medicine, and progress in the identification of nonopioid pain receptors and the development of products to target them are just a few of changes that have altered the way clinicians think about treating pain. The use of hospice in end-of-life palliative care is a valuable resource for clinicians managing pain at that phase in care as well. Tools are available to prevent and treat pain successfully in seniors. Educating clinicians about available assessment tools, techniques and interventions may be the biggest challenge to comforting the older adult in pain.",E,E

The initial pain at rest and on movement should be at least 50 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. The daily dose during the 7 days' treatment was 50 mg TRAM t.i.d. (n = 95) or 25 mg DKPT t.i.d. (n = 97). The patients were allowed to take additional Paracetamol up to 4 x 500 mg per day as rescue medication.; From the 4th day of treatment pain on movement decreased significantly (p = 0.044) in the DKPT-group in comparison with the TRAM-group. The nocturnal pain decreased during the treatments with a difference in therapies of 22.9% in favour of DKPT. Within the DKPT-group the patients required additional Paracetamol more often only during the 1st day of treatment whereas the patients of the TRAM-group required the additional rescue medication mainly during the first 3 days of treatment. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.011). Under DKPT treatment patients experienced significantly less adverse events (with an at least ""possible"" causal relationship; p = 0.026). This can be explained by central nervous disturbances that occurred only in the TRAM group. The distribution of gastro-intestinal disorders was identical in both treatment groups.; With this results DKPT in comparison with TRAM also showed to be a strong analgesic drug with a better risk-benefit relation due to its better tolerability.",E,E

This survey contained questions regarding treatment in response to 3 case vignettes, the use of opioids for CNMP in general, and the demographic characteristics of the physicians.; Among 230 physicians surveyed, 161 (70%) responded. Two percent of the respondents were never willing to prescribe schedule III opioids (eg, acetaminophen with codeine) as needed for patients with CNMP that persisted unchanged after exhaustive evaluation and attempts at treatment. Thirty-five percent were never willing to prescribe schedule II opioids (eg, sustained-release morphine) on an around-the-clock schedule for these patients. The most significant predictor of willingness to prescribe opioids for patients with CNMP was a lower level of concern about physical dependence, tolerance, and addiction.; Primary care physicians are willing to prescribe schedule III opioids as needed, but many are unwilling to use schedule II opioids around the clock for CNMP. Individual prescribing practices vary widely among primary care physicians. Concerns about physical dependence, tolerance, and addiction are barriers to the prescription of opioids by primary care physicians for patients with CNMP.",3,E

The physician's perceptions that patients were addicted to analgesics might be partially attributable to frustration with poor response to treatment. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the medical records of 20 subjects (15 male and 5 female) who were perceived as having addiction to meperidine by general physicians. The most common medical diagnosis among these patients was chronic pancreatitis (7/20). Among them, five had a past history of suicide attempt and three had self-injury behavior during the index admission. The fact that subjects were perceived as being addicted might be attributable to a vicious cycle of the following factors: 1) chronic intractable pain; 2) poor staff-patient relationship; 3) lower pain threshold or tolerance due to anxiety or depression; 4) patients with a history or tendency of substance abuse; 5) placebo use and inadequate analgesics regimen. The findings of this study suggest that the importance of the following diagnostic and treatment procedures in these patients: 1) suicide risk should be evaluated; 2) comorbid psychiatric diseases should be treated; 3) factors that cause a vicious cycle in pain control should be identified; 4) misconceptions of opiate analgesics among medical staff should be discussed; 5) poor staff-patient relationship should be managed aggressively; and 6) ""addiction"" is a critical diagnosis that should be avoided if possible.",E,E

An evaluation of overall survival, OPFS, and TTPP as a function of a PSA decline of > or = 50%, lasting at least 28 days, was undertaken by using a landmark analysis at 6, 9, and 12 weeks. A multivariate analysis of the impact of PSA decline was performed on these clinical end points.; A decline in PSA of > or = 50% lasting > or = 28 days was significantly associated with a prolonged median overall survival, OPFS, and TTPP, both in the entire group and the suramin plus hydrocortisone group at all three landmarks in both univariate and multivariate analysis.; In this prospective, randomized trial of suramin plus hydrocortisone versus placebo plus hydrocortisone, a posttherapy decline in PSA of > or = 50%, lasting 28 days, was associated with prolonged median overall survival, improved median progression-free survival, and median TTPP.

Acutely, NSAIDs may be more than mild analgesics, and may provide additional analgesia when combined with opioids. However, NSAIDs have ceiling effects and there is no therapeutic gain from increasing dosages beyond those recommended. As there is no clearly superior NSAID, the choice should be based on experience and the toxicity profile that probably relates to the COX-1:COX-2 ratio. Among the older drugs, ibuprofen seems to have these properties.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to have an opioid-sparing effect. Although the value of a simple narcotic-sparing effect may be questioned in cancer pain treatment, the use of NSAIDs may be useful when the increase in opioid dosage determine the occurrence of opioid toxicity. Like opioids, NSAIDs should not be considered analgesics for a specific type or cause of pain. There is a lack of evidence for any difference between different routes of NSAIDs administration. The long-term toxicity of NSAIDs in cancer pain is poorly defined due to a lack of studies. A variety of strategies have been used in an attempt to reduce the risks associated with NSAID therapy. Those NSAIDs that are weak COX-1 inhibitors may be preferred. In addition, concomitant administration of misoprostol is recommended in patients at increased risk for upper gastrointestinal complications.",E,E

The aim of this open-label, randomised, parallel group study was to compare analgesia and side-effects of two commonly used opioid analgesics, tramadol and dihydrocodeine, in long-acting formulations in 60 osteoarthritis patients with strong pain despite NSAID's. Dose titration based on effect was performed with the respective immediate release solutions given additionally to tramadol 100 mg bid and dihydrocodeine 60 mg bid during the first 4 days of the 1 month treatment. Electrical sensation and pain thresholds over the osteoarthritic joint and at a distant location and gastrointestinal transit times were performed before and during treatment. Thirty patients with pain controlled by NSAID's alone formed the comparator group. Pain intensities at rest and during movement decreased highly significantly with tramadol and dihydrocodeine from median pre-treatment verbal ratings of over 3 (0=none, 4=unbearable) to 1 and below from the second treatment day onwards (ANOVA P<0.0001). Pain at rest was significantly lower with tramadol (ANOVA P=0.04), but ratings were similar during movement. Mean (95% CI) daily doses on days 1 and 28 were 209 (198-220) mg and 203 (191-206) mg of tramadol, and 129 (122-136) mg and 130 (121-134) mg of dihydrocodeine, respectively. Minor side-effects were more common with tramadol (P=0.04). Changes in bowel functions and symptoms were minor with both treatments, but the frequency of defaecation was lower and stools were harder with dihydrocodeine. Orocaecal transit time remained unchanged and similar to controls with both analgesics. Colonic transit times only increased significantly during treatment with dihydrocodeine. Sensation and pain thresholds were lower pre-treatment in both groups than in controls and increased during treatment. These antinociceptive effects were more marked in the tramadol group and distant from the osteoarthritic joint. We conclude rapid pain relief was achieved with both long-acting tramadol and dihydrocodeine with NSAID's in strong osteoarthritis pain. Minimal dose titration was required and side-effects were minor. Tramadol interfered less with intestinal function and showed greater antinociceptive action.",E,E

Previous studies with open-label comparisons indicated OTFC was more effective than patients' usual opioid for breakthrough pain. The objective of this study was to compare OTFC and morphine sulfate immediate release (MSIR) for management of breakthrough pain in patients receiving a fixed scheduled opioid regimen. This double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, multiple crossover study was conducted at 19 US university- and community-based hospitals and clinics and comprised 134 adult ambulatory cancer patients. Patients were receiving a fixed scheduled opioid regimen equivalent to 60-1000 mg/day oral morphine or 50-300 microg/h transdermal fentanyl, were using a 'successful' MSIR dose (15-60 mg) as defined by entry criteria, and were experiencing 1-4 episodes of breakthrough pain per day. In open-label fashion, OTFC was titrated such that a single unit (200-1600 microg) provided adequate pain relief with acceptable side effects. Successfully titrated patients entered the double-blind phase of the study and received ten prenumbered sets of randomized capsules and oral transmucosal units. Five sets were the successful OTFC dose paired with placebo capsules, and five sets were placebo OTFC paired with capsules containing the successful MSIR dose. Patients took one set of study medication for each episode of target breakthrough pain. Pain intensity (PI), pain relief (PR) and global performance of medication (GP) scores were recorded. Pain intensity differences (PID) were calculated and 15-min PID was the primary efficacy variable. Adverse events were recorded. Sixty-nine percent of patients (93/134) found a successful dose of OTFC. OTFC yielded outcomes (PI, PID, and PR) at all time points that were significantly better than MSIR. GP also favored OTFC and more patients opted to continue with OTFC than MSIR following the study. Somnolence, nausea, constipation, and dizziness were the most common drug-associated side effects. In conclusion, OTFC was more effective than MSIR in treating breakthrough cancer pain.",E,E

This study characterizes the effects of intravenously infused alfentanil (a mu-receptor agonist) and ketamine (an NMDA-receptor antagonist) on human neuropathic pain states, characterized by allodynia and hyperalgesia. Using diphenhydramine as the placebo, alfentanil and ketamine infusions were given in a randomized double-blind fashion 1 week apart via a computer-controlled infusion (CCI) pump that was programmed to target plasma levels of alfentanil at 25, 50 and 75 ng/ml and ketamine at 50, 100 and 150 ng/ml. At the beginning of each infusion and each targeted plasma level, baseline vital signs, neurosensory testing that included thermal thresholds, thermal pain and von Frey filament thresholds, and spontaneous and evoked pain scores were obtained. Moreover, the areas of allodynia or hyperalgesia to stroking and a 5.18 von Frey filament were mapped at the beginning and the end of each infusion. A total of seven males and five females with post-nerve injury allodynia and hyperalgesia were enrolled in the study. Elevations of cold, warm, hot pain and von Frey tactile thresholds were noted. Dose-dependent increases in cold and cold pain thresholds, and reductions in stroking pain scores were noted in both the alfentanil and the ketamine infusions. In addition, alfentanil showed a statistically significant dose-dependent reduction in both spontaneous and von Frey pain scores. Both the alfentanil and ketamine infusions showed a reduction in the stroking hyperalgesic area and ketamine showed a significant reduction in the von Frey hyperalgesia area. No significant CNS side effects and changes in vital signs were noted. A partial deafferentation state was found in the post-nerve injury patients who presented with allodynia and hyperalgesia. The effects of alfentanil on cold and cold pain thresholds and spontaneous pain scores correlates with previous studies suggesting an opiate central analgesic effect. In addition, the reduction of the hyperalgesic area and evoked pain scores with the alfentanil infusion suggests that opioids may have some peripheral effects in the post-nerve injury patients. Therefore, clinical utilization of opioids with careful titration may be beneficial in post-nerve injury patients with partial deafferentation. With the absence of significant CNS side effects, the ketamine infusion not only demonstrated the well-documented spinal cord mechanism of the NMDA receptor, but the result of the current study also suggests that a peripheral mechanism of NMDA receptor may exist. The relationship between central sensitization and regulation of peripheral NMDA-receptor expression requires further investigation.",E,E

Although such therapeutic failures are often ascribed to pharmacological or psychological factors, difficulties in elucidating pain-generating mechanisms may be the main cause of insufficient pain management. These difficulties arise from several origins, including the unsuitability of the usual classification of pain, the exclusive use of etiology or symptom criteria as the main dimension of pain to guide the choice of therapeutic agents, the inadequate interpretation of sensory deficit, the lack of identification of the injured tissues, the absence of objective pain assessment by psychophysical methods. In this paper, we review briefly some fundamental knowledge to determine pain treatment based on the identification of the physiopathological mechanisms of pain. We advocate that once pain-generating mechanisms are known, it becomes possible to establish the appropriate treatment of pain.",E,E

It was hypothesized that intraoperative ketorolac or bupivacaine would reduce postoperative pain as measured by morphine demand.; After Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and informed consent, 30 patients undergoing single-level microsurgical lumbar discectomy under general anesthesia randomly received either intravenous ketorolac, intramuscular bupivacaine, or placebo before wound closure. After surgery, all patients received intravenous, MSO4, patient-controlled analgesia. MSO4 demand was compared between groups at 30 minutes and at 1, 4, 8, 16, 20, and 24 hours after surgery by one-way ANOVA. Pre- and postoperative pain was assessed by using a standard scale and was correlated to postoperative MSO4 demand by Pearson correlation.

The therapy consists of corticosteroids and analgetics. There was a 70 year old woman who suffered from painful paresis of the abducent and oculomotor nerves following an infection with Borrelia Burgdorferi--but without ocular symptoms. The treatment with corticosteroids reduced the palsy but she complained of excessively painful attacks in the region of the first branch of the trigeminal nerve. Opiold analgetic therapy did not bring about any relief. Acupuncture is an irritative method with a physical effect on the nervous system: its pain-reducing effect is caused by the activation of transmitters like endorphins in thalamus and brain stem. Knowing this effect, the THS patient, after informed consent, was treated with acupuncture. To measure the extent of pain, a visual analog scale (0: no pain - 10: maximum pain) was used. Acupuncture was performed according to the empirical rules of the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), during a period of 10 weeks and 12 weeks. There was a significant pain relief after acupuncture from VAS 10 to VAS 5. The effect vanished during the next four months. After a second series of 12 sessions pain reduction was reported from VAS 10 to 4. One year after the last Tolosa Hunt Syndrome - intractable pain pain strength ranged between VAS 4 - 6.

The patient's presentation and initial management are unique.; A 40-year-old woman reported severe left foot and calf pain, numbness, and weakness. The symptoms were evident during three pregnancies, and they gradually progressed. The neuropathic pain was protracted, despite implantation of a dorsal column stimulator and administration of a wide variety of medications and therapies. The symptoms were unresponsive to both inpatient and outpatient treatments, which resulted in a misdiagnosis of psychogenic pain for more than a decade. Diagnostic scans obtained by computed tomography, ultrasonography, and nuclear scintigraphy confirmed a popliteal fossa mass.; A high, large posterior tibial nerve neurilemoma was found intraoperatively, positioned just below the sciatic nerve bifurcation with extensive degenerative features and hemorrhages. Surgical resection provided immediate recovery.; Peripheral nerve tumors are rarely acknowledged clinical entities.

The Amsterdam Pain Management Index compares patients' Present Pain Intensity, Average Pain Intensity, and Worst Pain Intensity with a composite score of analgesics used, while correcting for what a patient considers as a tolerable level of pain. The eight frequently used outcome measure consisted of three Pain Intensity Markers, the Pain Relief Scale, the Patient Satisfaction Scale, and three Pain Management Indexes. In a randomized controlled trial, 313 cancer patients with a pain duration of at least 1 month were included and followed-up three times until 2 months postdischarge at home. The experimental group received a Pain Education Program, consisting of tailored pain information and instruction. Results showed that, except for the three Pain Management Indexes, the agreement between the measures was very low to moderate. The test of known-groups comparisons and equivalence between groups indicated that the Amsterdam Pain Management Index showed promising results. The Pain Intensity Markers and the Pain Relief Scale were limited in discriminating between groups, while the Patient Satisfaction Scale showed no differences between patient groups. Although it was possible for the Pain Management Indexes to distinguish between patient groups, the differences were not in the expected direction. The ability of the outcome measures to detect changes over time was clearly demonstrated by all outcome measures.

We tested the hypothesis that addition of ropivacaine 1 mg x ml(-1) to epidural fentanyl (10 microg x ml(-1)) postoperatively decreases the need for fentanyl, improves the quality of analgesia and decreases the side-effects of fentanyl.; Forty patients were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized study to receive either fentanyl 10 microg x ml(-1) (group F) alone or fentanyl combined with ropivacaine 1 mg x ml(-1) (group R) for 20 h as an epidural infusion at TH12-L1 or L1-L2 for analgesia after hip replacement surgery. The patients were free to use a patient-controlled epidural analgesia device, which was programmed to infuse 3 ml of the study medication hourly and to allow a 3-ml bolus when needed (maximal hourly dose of fentanyl was 150 microg). The consumption of medication, visual pain scores at rest and on movement, hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, motor and sensory block, nausea, pruritus and sedation were recorded.; There were no significant differences between the groups in the total mean fentanyl consumption (1.10+/-0.18 mg in group F, 1.08+/-0.31 mg in group R, 95% CI: -0.14 to 0.19, P = 0.774). The pain scores were similar at rest (median scores < or = 1) and on movement (median scores < or = 3). The adverse effects were similar and of a minor nature, consisting mostly of pruritus and nausea.; Addition of ropivacaine 1 mg x ml(-1) to epidural fentanyl 10 microg x ml(-1) did not significantly decrease the requirement for fentanyl administered for pain relief after hip replacement surgery.",E,E

Sixteen patients achieved more than 50% pain relief after a trial period of intrathecal morphine infusion. They were implanted with fully implantable and programmable pumps through which morphine was delivered intrathecally on a continuous basis. These patients were followed prospectively and underwent careful evaluation of their functional and mental status, and pain intensity measurements using standardized techniques before treatment and every 6 months thereafter in the follow-up period. The follow-up period ranged from 13 months to 49 months (mean 29.14 months +/- 12.44 months) for the patients who had implanted morphine pumps.; The mean morphine dosage initially administered was 1.11 mg/day (range 0.2--6.5 mg/day); after 6 months, it was 3.1 mg/day (range 0.4--8.75 mg/day). In long-term observation, no patient had a constant dosage history. The patients who received intrathecal morphine for longer than 2 years all showed an increase in morphine dosage to more than 10 mg/day. The best long-term results were seen with deafferentation pain and mixed pain, with 75% and 61% pain reduction (visual analog scale), respectively. Nociceptive pain patients had best pain relief initially (78% pain reduction) but it tended to decrease over the follow-up period to 57% pain reduction at final follow-up. The average pain reduction for all groups after 6 months was 67.5% and at last follow-up, it was 57.5%. Ten patients were satisfied with the delivery system and eleven reported improvement in their quality of life. In two patients, morphine was not able to adequately control the pain without producing undesirable side effects requiring the addition of clonidine to their infusion medication. In this series, 12 patients were considered successes and 4 patients were considered failures. In two patients, the intrathecal opioid therapy was unable to produce satisfactory pain relief and in the other two patients the pumps had to be explanted because of intolerable side effects.; In our experience, the administration of intrathecal opioid medications for nonmalignant pain is justified in carefully selected patients.",E,E

It can be administered by injection, by infusion, by mouth, and rectally. Oral bioavailability is low. The kidney excretes hydromorphone and its metabolites. Some metabolites may have greater analgesic activity than hydromorphone itself but are unlikely to contribute to the pharmacological activity of hydromorphone. With the exception of pruritus, sedation and nausea and vomiting, which may occur less after hydromorphone than after morphine, the side-effects of these drugs are similar. On a milligram basis hydromorphone is five times as potent as morphine when given by the oral route, and 8.5 times as potent as morphine when given intravenously.",E,E

The treatment group (n = 12) received infiltrations with bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 1:200,000 presurgically (10 ml into the portals, 10 ml at the medial tibial incision site, 10 ml at the lateral femoral incision site, and 10 ml intra-articularly) and postsurgically (5 ml at the medial tibial incision and 10 ml at the lateral femoral incision). The control group (n = 11) received infiltrations with saline 0.9% in the same manner. All patients received a standard intra-articular local anesthetic instillation of the knee (25 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 1:200,000) at the completion of surgery.; Postoperative opioid requirements were lower in the treatment group (5.8 +/- 2.9 mg morphine equivalent) than in the control group ( 13.7 +/- 5.8 mg; P = 0.008).

We hypothesised that the use of a very low concentration technique (ropivacaine/fentanyl) might result in excessive dosing in the PCEA group, more motor blockade and a negative impact on spontaneous delivery rate.; We conducted a randomised, double-blind study of 60 nulliparous women at term comparing low concentration ropivacaine/fentanyl administered in either patient-controlled or fixed continuous infusion mode. Parturients with known predictors of painful deliveries, i.e. breech presentation, primary induction of labour, were not included. Deliveries within 90 min from the start of epidural analgesia were omitted from the evaluation.; We found that both groups required a mean of 12 ml/h low concentration mixture (loading and midwife rescue boluses included). There was no difference between groups with respect to spontaneous delivery rate (71%). This low concentration technique resulted in haemodynamic stability without crystalloid preloading, infusion or vasopressor use. Motor blockade of clinical importance was not detected in any patient.; We conclude that epidural use of ropivacaine 1 mg/ml+fentanyl 2 microg/ml provides effective analgesia with equal volume requirements irrespective of administration mode, with a high spontaneous delivery rate. Choice of PCEA or CEI (continuous epidural infusion) should be directed by other considerations, most importantly compliance of midwife and possible reduction in workload for anaesthesiology staff.",E,E

Thirty pediatric patients were randomly divided into two groups: the intravenous patient-controlled analgesia group (with nalbuphine HCl and ketorolac tromethamine) and the conventional pethidine HCl intramuscular group. The degree of analgesia was assessed every 4 hours until the second postoperative day.

Preemptive use of controlled-release opioids may improve pain control, accelerate recovery, and reduce the need for inpatient rehabilitative services. This study was designed to determine whether controlled-release opioids enhance post-arthroplasty pain control and facilitate functional recovery during rehabilitation.; Fifty-nine patients admitted for inpatient rehabilitation following unilateral total knee arthroplasty were randomized to receive OxyContin (controlled-release oxycodone) (twenty-nine patients) or a placebo (thirty patients) every twelve hours. Both groups could receive on-request, immediate-release oxycodone (5 mg every four hours). The dose of study medication was increased on the basis of the frequency of requests for immediate-release oxycodone. Measures of interest included pain ratings as determined with a visual-analog scale, changes in the range of motion of the knee and quadriceps strength, and improvements in selected Functional Independence Measure scores during the first eight physical therapy sessions. The duration of the hospital stay for rehabilitation also was compared between the two groups.; Baseline demographic, clinical, and functional characteristics were similar between the OxyContin and placebo groups. Compared with the placebo group, the patients who received OxyContin reported significantly less pain as well as significantly greater range of motion of the knee (passive motion, p = 0.036; active motion, p< 0.001) and quadriceps strength (p = 0.001) by the eighth physical therapy session.

The tests included determination of pain tolerance thresholds to pressure, pain detection/tolerance thresholds to single electrical sural nerve stimulation and pain summation at tolerance threshold to repetitive electrical sural nerve stimulation (temporal summation) and pain experienced during the cold pressor test, rated as peak pain intensity, pain average intensity and discomfort. Compared to placebo, imipramine significantly increased pressure pain tolerance threshold (P = 0.03) and increased pain tolerance threshold (P = 0.05) and pain summation threshold (P = 0.03), but not pain detection threshold to electrical stimulation. Imipramine did not cause significant changes in pain perception during the cold pressor test. Codeine significantly increased pressure pain tolerance threshold (P = 0.02), pain detection (P = 0.04) and pain tolerance threshold (P = 0.01) and pain summation threshold (P = 0.02) to electrical stimulation. In addition, codeine reduced the pain experienced during the cold pressor test (P = 0.04-0.003). It is concluded that both imipramine and codeine inhibit temporal pain summation, whereas only codeine reduces cold pressor pain. Pain summation may be a key mechanism in neuropathic pain. Imipramine has a documented effect on such pain conditions on temporal summation. The present study showed that codeine also inhibits temporal summation, which is in line with the clinical observations indicating that opioids relieve neuropathic pain.",E,E

By these criteria, a substantial minority of patients treated with oral morphine (10% to 30%) do not have a successful outcome because of (1) excessive adverse effects, (2) inadequate analgesia, or (3) a combination of both excessive adverse effects along with inadequate analgesia. The management of excessive adverse effects remains a major clinical challenge. Multiple approaches have been described to address this problem. The clinical challenge of selecting the best option is enhanced by the lack of definitive, evidence-based comparative data. Indeed, this aspect of opioid therapeutics has become a focus of substantial controversy. This study presents evidence-based recommendations for clinical-practice formulated by an Expert Working Group of the European Association of Palliative Care (EAPC) Research NETWORK: These recommendations highlight the need for careful evaluation to distinguish between morphine adverse effects from comorbidity, dehydration, or drug interactions, and initial consideration of dose reduction (possibly by the addition of a co analgesic). If side effects persist, the clinician should consider options of symptomatic management of the adverse effect, opioid rotation, or switching route of systemic administration.

Opioid agonists are among the most effective analgesics available for reducing pain perception; however, their chronic use is controversial. This is primarily due to regulatory barriers, misunderstandings about pain management among primary caregivers, fear of adverse side effects, and misconceptions about the potential risks of addiction. Short-acting opioids provide effective analgesia for acute pain but should be avoided as primary analgesics for chronic pain management. Long-acting opioids have greater utility than short-acting opioids in treating chronic pain in patients with consistent pain levels. Results of studies show that improved quality of life is directly related to the use of long-acting opioids in patients with chronic pain of both cancer and noncancer etiology.

This controversy centers around pain control and appropriate narcotic dosage. Dentistry's role in treating chronic pain has become complex because of differing views on pain management protocols. The dental literature regarding chronic-pain management is limited, and dentistry has only a minimal role in pain management. It is time for dentistry to take a larger role in treating chronic pain. The effective use of medications is only one aspect of chronic-pain management. The success rate for managing intractable pain can be substantially improved if practitioners take advantage of early diagnosis, aggressive physiotherapy, and multiple sympathetic blocks, as well as other blocks and antidepressants. For dentists to take an active role in this arena, they need broader education in treatment regimens. Interdependence with physicians and cross-referral between these two professions may lead to more-favorable outcomes, including improved function and quality of life.",E,E

Better pain relief was the main reason for preference for fentanyl given by 35% of patients. More patients considered pain control as being ""good"" or ""very good"" with fentanyl than with morphine (35% v 23%, P=0.002). These results were reflected in both patients' and investigators' opinions on the global efficacy of transdermal fentanyl. Patients receiving fentanyl had on average higher quality of life scores than those receiving morphine. The incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups; however, more patients experienced constipation with morphine than with fentanyl (48% v 29%, P<0.001). Overall, 41% of patients experienced mild or moderate cutaneous problems associated with wearing the transdermal fentanyl patch, and more patients withdrew because of adverse events during treatment with fentanyl than with morphine (10% v 5%). However, within the subgroup of patients naive to both fentanyl and morphine, similar numbers of patients withdrew owing to adverse effects (11% v 10%, respectively).; Transdermal fentanyl was preferred to sustained release oral morphine by patients with chronic non-cancer pain previously treated with opioids.

Lack of knowledge about opioids, negative attitudes toward prescribing opioids, and inadequate pain-assessment skills combine to create major barriers to pain relief. Patient-related barriers, such as lack of communication and unwarranted fears of addiction, further complicate pain assessment and treatment. The health care system itself can hinder pain relief through practical constraints in the community and fear of regulatory scrutiny by the physician.; Information was gathered by doing a literature search, collating clinical information from practice and additional research findings from national meetings, and reviewing the Bulletin of the American Pain Society. Key search terms included ""pain,"" ""chronic pain,"" ""pain management,"" ""pain assessment,"" ""pain treatment,"" and ""barriers to pain management.""; Concrete steps for the clinician engaged in the treatment of chronic pain include selection and administration of an effective opioid, dose titration, short- vs long-acting opioids, opioid rotation, ongoing assessment, and consideration of patient preferences.

A subset of patients with CP have intermittent acute exacerbations, often with increasing frequency and often unrelated to ongoing ethanol abuse. Little data exist regarding the effectiveness of surgery to prevent acute attacks.; From 1985 to 1999, all patients identified with a diagnosis of CP were recruited to participate in an ongoing program of serial clinic visits and functional and clinical evaluations. Patients were offered surgery using standard criteria. Data were gathered regarding ethanol abuse, pain, narcotic use, and recurrent acute exacerbations requiring hospital admission before and after surgery. Patients were broadly categorized as having severe unrelenting pain alone (group 1), severe pain with intermittent acute exacerbations (group 2), and intermittent acute exacerbations only (group 3).; Two hundred fifty-nine patients were recruited. One hundred eighty-five patients underwent 199 surgical procedures (124 modified Puestow procedure [LPJ], 29 distal pancreatectomies [DP], and 46 pancreatic head resections [PHR; 14 performed after failure of LPJ]). There were no deaths. The complication rate was 4% for LPJ, 15% for DP, and 27% for PHR. Ethanol abuse was causative in 238 patients (92%). Mean follow-up was 81 months. There were 104 patients in group 1 (86 who underwent surgery), 71 patients in group 2 (64 who underwent surgery), and 84 in group 3 (49 who underwent surgery). No patient without surgery had spontaneous resolution of symptoms. Postoperative pain relief (freedom from narcotic analgesics) was achieved in 153 of 185 patients (83%) overall: 106 of 124 (86%) for LPJ, 19 of 29 (67%) for DP, and 42 of 46 (91%) for PHR. The mean rate of acute exacerbations was 6.3 +/- 2.1 events per year before surgery in group 2 and 7.8 +/- 1.8 events per year in group 3. After surgery, no acute exacerbations occurred in 42 of 64 (66%) group 2 patients and in 40 of 49 (82%) group 3 patients. The mean number of episodes of acute exacerbation after surgery was 1.6 +/- 2.3 events in group 2 and 1.1 +/- 1.9 events in group 3. Only four patients in group 2 and one patient in group 3 had an equal or increased frequency of attacks after surgery. Preventing attacks was most effective with LPJ (58/64, 91%) and least effective for DP (6/18, 33%).; Surgical intervention prevents recurrent acute exacerbations. The overall frequency of events was reduced in nearly all patients. Therefore, surgical intervention is indicated in patients with CP whose disease is characterized by recurrent acute exacerbations.",E,E

After surgery, a patient-controlled analgesia device (PCA) provided free access to additional intravenous morphine. Children were monitored for 24 h in the postanesthesia care unit.; The three groups were similar for age, weight, duration of surgery, and time to extubation. The time to first PCA demand was dose-dependently delayed by intrathecal morphine.

Pain scores at rest were significantly lower over the whole study period after 2 and 5 microg/kg intrathecal morphine than after saline, but there was no difference between intrathecal doses. Pain scores while coughing and the incidence of side effects were similar in the three groups.; These data demonstrate that low-dose intrathecal morphine supplemented by PCA morphine provides better analgesia than PCA morphine alone after spinal fusion in children.

This study aimed to determine the median effective dose (ED50) of intrathecal bupivacaine, defined as the minimum local analgesic dose (MLAD), and then use this to assess the effect of different doses of fentanyl.; In this double-blind, randomized, prospective study, 124 parturients receiving combined spinal epidural analgesia at 2-6-cm cervical dilatation were allocated to one of four groups to receive bupivacaine alone or with 5, 15, or 25 microg fentanyl, using the technique of up-down sequential allocation. Analgesic effectiveness was assessed using 100-mm visual analog pain scores, with less than or equal to 10 mm within 15 min defined as effective. MLAD was calculated using the formula of Dixon and Massey. Pruritus and duration of spinal analgesia were also recorded.; Minimum local analgesic dose of intrathecal bupivacaine was 1.99 mg (95% confidence interval, 1.71, 2.27). There were similar significant reductions in MLAD (P < 0.001) for all bupivacaine-fentanyl groups compared with bupivacaine control. There was a dose-dependent increase in both pruritus and duration of spinal analgesia with increasing fentanyl (P < 0.0001).; Under the conditions of this study, the addition of intrathecal fentanyl 5 microg offers a similar significant bupivacaine dose-sparing effect as 15 and 25 microg.

The remaining three participated in the low and moderate conditions. A semirandomized study protocol was used with control and remifentanil conditions 3 or more months apart. The order of low and moderate conditions was randomized. Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were monitored. Categoric comparisons between the control, low, and moderate conditions and a pixelwise correlation analysis across the three conditions were performed (P < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) using statistical parametric mapping.; Cardiorespiratory parameters were maintained constant over time. At the low remifentanil dose, significant increases in relative rCBF were noted in the lateral prefrontal cortices, inferior parietal cortices, and supplementary motor area. Relative rCBF decreases were observed in the basal mediofrontal cortex, cerebellum, superior temporal lobe, and midbrain gray matter. Moderate doses further increased rCBF in mediofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, occipital lobe transition, and caudal periventricular grey. Significant decreases were detected in the inferior parietal lobes. These dose-dependent effects of remifentanil on rCBF were confirmed by a correlation analysis.; Remifentanil induced dose-dependent changes in relative rCBF in areas involved in pain processing. At moderate doses, rCBF responses were additionally detected in structures known to participate in modulation of vigilance and alertness.

The reported prevalence of chronic SCI pain is variable but averages 65% with around one third of these people rating their pain as severe. The mechanisms responsible for the presence of pain are poorly understood. However, evidence from clinical observations and the use of animal models of SCI pain suggests that a number of processes may be important. These include functional and structural plastic changes in the central nervous system following injury, with changes in receptor function and loss of normal inhibition resulting in an increased neuronal excitability. A number of specific types of SCI pain can be distinguished based on descriptors, location and response to treatment. Nociceptive pain can arise from musculoskeletal structures and viscera and neuropathic pain can arise from spinal cord and nerve damage. The role of psychological and environmental factors also needs to be considered. Accurate identification of these pain types will help in selecting appropriate treatment approaches. Current treatments employ a variety of pharmacological, surgical, physical and psychological approaches. However, evidence for many of the treatments in use is still limited.

Here we report that different expectations produce different analgesic effects which in turn can be harnessed in clinical practice. Thoracotomized patients were treated with buprenorphine on request for 3 consecutive days, together with a basal intravenous infusion of saline solution. However, the symbolic meaning of this basal infusion was changed in three different groups of patients. The first group was told nothing about any analgesic effect (natural history). The second group was told that the basal infusion was either a powerful painkiller or a placebo (classic double-blind administration). The third group was told that the basal infusion was a potent painkiller (deceptive administration). Therefore, whereas the analgesic treatment was exactly the same in the three groups, the verbal instructions about the basal infusion differed. The placebo effect of the saline basal infusion was measured by recording the doses of buprenorphine requested over the three-days treatment. We found that the double-blind group showed a reduction of buprenorphine requests compared to the natural history group. However, this reduction was even larger in the deceptive administration group. Overall, after 3 days of placebo infusion, the first group received 11.55 mg of buprenorphine, the second group 9.15 mg, and the third group 7.65 mg. Despite these dose differences, analgesia was the same in the three groups. These results indicate that different verbal instructions about certain and uncertain expectations of analgesia produce different placebo analgesic effects, which in turn trigger a dramatic change of behaviour leading to a significant reduction of opioid intake.",E,E

An effect on hip pain has also been described. However, being a time-consuming and operator-dependent procedure if performed manually, it has not been widely used for chronic hip pain. The purpose of this pilot study was to check whether CT guidance could improve reproducibility of the block (= immediate effect) and to test its potential value for treatment of chronic hip pain. Fifteen chronically ill patients with osteoarthritis underwent a single ONB. Sixteen millilitres of Lidocaine 1% mixed with 2 ml Iopramide was injected into the obturator canal. The patients were followed up to 9 months after the intervention. With a single injection pain relief was achieved for 1-8 weeks in 7 of 15 patients. Excellent pain relief for 3-11 months was achieved in another 4 patients. Reasons for a mid-term or even long-term effect based on a single injection of local anaesthetic are not exactly known.

The inclusion of pain as an area of clinical focus in the Minimum Data Set has fueled interest in this problem and will provide solid data for future study. Researchers are attempting to establish reliable and valid data using standardized assessment tools previously validated in younger adults and are attempting use of traditional and cutting-edge assessment tools in cognitively impaired patients. Assessment is being linked to innovative interventions in noncommunicative, cognitively impaired residents using primary care nurses who best know these patients to decipher ""normal"" from ""abnormal"" behavior. The application of available pharmacologic interventions are more challenging because of the higher incidence of side effects in the elderly; part of this problem is the result of the decreased hepatic metabolism and renal clearance present in older patients. The nursing home environment has limited resources that can create logistical concerns in terms of diagnosis and treatment but also can positively limit overly invasive modalities.

Glutamate and glutamate receptors are located in areas of the brain, spinal cord and periphery that are involved in pain sensation and transmission. Glutamate acts at several types of receptors, including ionotropic (directly coupled to ion channels) and metabotropic (directly coupled to intracellular second messengers). Ionotropic receptors include those selectively activated by N-methyl-D-aspartate, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid and kainate. Metabotropic glutamate receptors are classified into 3 groups based on sequence homology, signal transduction mechanisms and receptor pharmacology. Glutamate also interacts with the opioid system, and intrathecal or systemic coadministration of glutamate receptor antagonists with opioids may enhance analgesia while reducing the development of opioid tolerance and dependence. The actions of glutamate in the brain seem to be more complex. Activation of glutamate receptors in some brain areas seems to be pronociceptive (e.g. thalamus, trigeminal nucleus), although activation of glutamate receptors in other brain areas seems to be antinociceptive (e.g. periaqueductal grey, ventrolateral medulla). Application of glutamate, or agonists selective for one of the several types of glutamate receptor, to the spinal cord or periphery induces nociceptive behaviours. Inhibition of glutamate release, or of glutamate receptors, in the spinal cord or periphery attenuates both acute and chronic pain in animal models. Similar benefits have been seen in studies involving humans (both patients and volunteers); however, results have been inconsistent. More research is needed to clearly define the role of existing treatment options and explore the possibilities for future drug development.",E,E

A linear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM) was performed to detect drug, placebo, and time effect as well as interindividual and intraindividual variation of effect.; Only the electrical, ice-water, and pressure pain tests are sensitive to assess a concentration-response curve of alfentanil. At a plasma alfentanil concentration of 100 ng/ml, the increase in pain tolerance compared with baseline was 42.0% for electrical pain, 22.2% for pressure pain, and 21.7% for ice-water pain. The slope of the linear concentration-response curve had an interindividual coefficient of variation of 58.3% in electrical pain, 35.6% in pressure pain, and 60.0% in ice-water pain. The residual error including intraindividual variation at an alfentanil concentration of 100 ng/ml was 19.4% for electrical pain, 6.1% for pressure pain, and 13.0% for ice-water pain.

Patient satisfaction was assessed and factors of importance for satisfaction/dissatisfaction were analysed. It was found that 88% of the patients had previously undergone surgical procedures and that 53% of these patients claimed to have experienced moderate or severe pain at that time. Current pain prior to the present surgical procedure was reported by 61% of the patients. Most patients (91%) expected pain of moderate to severe intensity and 76% reported to have experienced such pain levels. In spite of this 81% of the patients claimed to be satisfied with the pain management while only 8% were dissatisfied. Sex, age, pre-operative expectation and actual experience of pain relief, and the overall pain experience were found to be factors associated with the probability of being satisfied/dissatisfied. Main characteristics of the dissatisfied patient were a younger age and female sex. It is concluded that patients commonly expect moderate to severe pain in the postoperative period and that the actual pain experience is mainly in accordance with the pre-operative expectations. Therefore, the validity of patient satisfaction as an optimal outcome variable in quality assurance processes of postoperative pain management may be questioned.",E,E

The anaesthesia was standardised. Postoperative analgesia was provided by a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). The pain scores were recorded by means of a visual analogue scale. Nausea, emesis, bowel function, fatigue, well-being and duration of hospital stay were studied as outcome variables.; On the day of surgery, patients exposed to music in combination with therapeutic suggestions required less rescue analgesic compared with the controls. Patients in the music group experienced more effective analgesia the first day after surgery and could be mobilised earlier after the operation. At discharge from the hospital patients in the music and music combined with therapeutic suggestion group were less fatigued compared to the controls. No differences were noted in nausea, emesis, bowel function, well-being or length of hospital stay between the groups.; This double-blind study has demonstrated that intra-operative music and music in combination with therapeutic suggestions may have some beneficial effects on postoperative recovery after hysterectomy.

Group B (n = 124) received the same medication upon request during the procedure. Tolerance was assessed 24 hours later by phone interview performed by a nurse blinded to the medication regimen administered.; Eighty-three patients (66%) in Group B required sedation during colonoscopy.

This was accomplished via a randomised double-blind study with crossover at an outpatient clinic in Bern, Switzerland. The subjects were 39 patients with a long history of intravenous opioid use and persistent abuse despite treatment; they were randomly allocated to two groups. Group A was started on controlled injection of graduated doses of morphine up to a satisfying individual dose and was then switched as a double blind to heroin at a randomly determined day between week three and four. Subsequently this group was given heroin for the remaining two to three weeks of the study. Group B was started on heroin and was then switched to morphine in the same manner. Equipotent solutions of 3% morphine and 2% heroin were administered. The main outcome measures were clinical observations, structural interviews and self report of subjective experiences to assess the effects of the drugs. In 16 cases, the study had to be discontinued owing to severe morphine-induced histamine reactions. Thirteen participants in Group B presented these adverse reactions on the day of the switch-over. Full data were thus only obtainable for 17 participants. Average daily doses were 491 mg for heroin and 597 mg for morphine. The findings indicate that heroin significantly produced a lower grade of itching, flushing, urticaria and pain/nausea. A negative correlation between dose and euphoria was observed for both heroin and morphine. The authors concluded that as heroin produces fewer side effects it is the preferred high-dose maintenance prescription to morphine. The perceived euphoric effects are limited in both substances.",E,E

Managing severe pain with drug therapy by using a combination of narcotics, non-narcotics, and adjuvant drugs provides the best results for most patients. In patients with fractures due to bone metastases there is a relative indication for operative treatment if the patient is expected to survive the operation and to recover in the postoperative period. In this case report a terminal 48 year-old female with a pathological femoral neck fracture is presented. No operative treatment was offered because of her bad general status. Pain control was maintained by continuous administration of local analgesics directly into the intra-articular femoral space, through a system of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). The visual-analogue pain scale (VAS), which was maximal before beginning of this treatment, was markedly reduced during the treatment, and was again elevated to maximum after the intra-articular catheter was removed. Although continuous regional analgesia to a fractured bone which involves the joint is not a generally acceptable method and carries some risks it has a role in a selected group of patients.",E,E

After endodontic treatment, patients randomly received either an apical trephination or mock trephination procedure. The trephination procedure used a Stabident perforator to provide an initial opening in the cortical bone that was enlarged with files (#25 through #120) and an endodontic spoon. Postoperatively, each patient received: ibuprofen; acetaminophen with codeine (30 mg); and a 7-day diary to record pain, percussion pain, swelling, and number and type of pain medication taken. Results demonstrated the use of an apical trephination procedure did not significantly (p > 0.05) reduce pain, percussion pain, swelling, or number of ibuprofen tablets taken in symptomatic necrotic teeth with periapical radiolucencies. The trephination procedure did significantly (p < 0.05) reduce the use of acetaminophen with codeine overall for the 7 days.

Pain detection by clinic examination or by pain assessment's methods and adequate approach by pharmacological and non pharmacological therapies are essential for correct pain management. On pharmacological plan, the strategy of the O.M.S. landings is applicable owing to a more particular attention to secondary effects and drugs interactions. AINS must be manipulated with prudence. There are no reasons to exclude opioides from the therapeutic arsenal but with a reduction of the starting doses, a regular adaptation and a very attentive survey. In drugs of landing 2, tramadol reveals itself as efficient and better tolerated as the codeine and dextropropoxyphene has to be to avoid. The obtaining of a satisfactory result depends on a regular assessment of the pain in a context of polydisciplinar approach (physicians, nurses, paramedicals, other care givers).",E,E

The myelo-CT image showed a avulsion of the cervical roots C7/C8. Five days after the accident the patient complained of phantom pain in the right plegic arm and was presented to our acute pain service (APS). The patient complained of lancinating attacks of severe phantom pain in the right arm (visual analogue scale intensity of 80-100 pts.). The initial pain treatment was performed with PCA (piritramide), and because of the lancinating pain character carbamazepine treatment was introduced. The pain intensity increased under carbamazepine (VAS = 100 pts.), and after treatment with five cycles of salmon-calcitonin infusion the pain intensity decreased (VAS = 10 pts). After withdrawal of the infusion therapy with salmon calcitonin the pain intensity increased up to VAS = 70 pts. TENS therapy five times per day showed no analgetic effect. We repeated the calcitonin-infusion therapy and after five i.v. cycles we continued with 200 I.U. salmon calcitonin intranasal per day. The initial phantompain intensity decreased (VAS = 40 pts.), but showed no long term analgesia. The additional psychological treatment with relaxation techniques (Jacobson/Bensen) showed the desired phantom pain relief.

The optimal dose should avoid under-dosing or overdosing, both associated with negative outcomes for the patient. Although equianalgesic dose tables are generally used to determine the new doses in these circumstances, the evidence to support the ratios indicated in these tables largely refers to the context of single dose administration. The applicability of these ratios to the setting of chronic opioid administration has been questioned. A systematic search of published literature from 1966 to September 1999 was conducted to critically appraise the emerging evidence on equianalgesic dose ratios derived from studies of chronic opioid administration. There were six major findings: 1) there exists a general paucity of data related to long-term dosing and studies are heterogeneous in nature; 2) the ratios exhibit extremely wide ranges; 3) methadone is more potent than previously appreciated; 4) the ratios related to methadone are highly correlated with the dose of the previous opioid; 5) the ratio may change according to the direction the opioid switch; and 6) discrepancies exist with respect to both oxycodone and fentanyl. Overall, these findings have important clinical implications for clinicians and warrant consideration in the potential revision of current tables. The complexity of the clinical context in which many switches occur must be recognized and also appreciated in the design of future studies.",3,E

Alfentanil, S(+)-ketamine, and lidocaine were applied for 20 min in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 12 subjects using target controlled infusions.; In the placebo session, pain ratings and areas of hyperalgesia were stable during the stimulation period, which facilitated the assessment of analgesic effects. Alfentanil effectively inhibited electrically evoked pain and reduced pin prick hyperalgesia and allodynia during its infusion. S(+)-ketamine-induced inhibition of secondary hyperalgesia was more pronounced and lasted for the whole experimental protocol. Therapeutic levels of systemic lidocaine showed only marginal analgesic effects, but lasting antihyperalgesic effects.; A new model of electrically induced pain and hyperalgesia was established, which enabled assessment of the time course of analgesic and antihyperalgesic effects with high temporal resolution and minimum tissue damage and which was further validated by use of common intravenous anesthetics.",E,E

Although several alternative forms of post-thoracotomy analgesia exist, all have their disadvantages. Cryoanalgesia, localized freezing of intercostal nerves, has been reported to have variable effectiveness and an incidence of long-term cutaneous sensory changes. We carried out an animal study to assess the reversibility of histological changes induced by cryoanalgesia and a prospective randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of cryoanalgesia with conventional analgesia (parenteral opiates).; In six anaesthetized dogs, intercostal nerves were exposed to a varying duration of cryo-application (30, 60, 90 and 120 s). The nerves were biopsied and examined histologically at regular intervals over the following 6 months. In the clinical study, 200 consecutive patients undergoing thoracotomy were randomized to cryoanalgesia and conventional (parenteral opiates) analgesia groups. Postoperative pain scores, respiratory function tests and use of opiate analgesia were measured for the two groups.; Following application of the cryoprobe, degeneration and fragmentation of the axons was evident with associated inflammatory changes. As the endoneurium remained intact, axonal regeneration took place after the resolution of axonal swelling. Over the course of weeks, recovery of the intercostal nerve occurred and was complete after 1 month for the 30 and 60 s groups. For nerves exposed to longer durations of cryoanalgesia, the time taken for complete recovery was proportionally increased. Clinically, there was a statistically significant (P<0.05) improvement in postoperative pain scores and use of opiate analgesia and an improvement (P>0.05) in respiratory function tests for patients in the cryoanalgesia group. The previously suggested cutaneous sensory changes resolved within 6 months with complete restoration of function.; We suggest that cryoanalgesia be considered as a simple, inexpensive, long-term form of post-thoracotomy pain relief, which does not cause any long-term histological damage to intercostal nerves.",E,E

Immediately after surgery, patients applied either a temperature-controlled cooling blanket (CCT) or a standard ice pack over their surgical dressings. Pain was assessed by visual analog scale and swelling by wrist circumference preoperatively, immediately after surgery, and on postoperative day 3. Patients kept log books of daily treatment times. Narcotic use (of Vicodin ES) was determined by pill count at day 3 and by daily log book recordings. Patients who used CCT showed significantly greater reduction in pain, edema (wrist circumference), and narcotic use at postoperative day 3 than did those using ice therapy.

An impressive body of neuroanatomical, neurochemical and biobehavioural evidence, which has accumulated over the past 2 decades, supports this capability. This evidence mandates health professionals to attend to the prevention, elimination, or at the very least, control of pain for infants. This mandate is essential since pain is known to have both immediate and long term effects, especially if pain is untreated and is severe, prolonged or frequently experienced. Therefore, pain must be assessed frequently, not only to measure location, intensity and duration but also to determine the effectiveness of interventions implemented to control pain. An impressive array of measures for assessing acute pain in infants exists which incorporates valid pain indicators in this population. However, there is a need to develop new measures to assess chronic pain conditions and pain in infants in acute situations.",E,E

The study group received 100 mg rectal diclofenac immediately after cesarean section followed by 50 mg at 12 hours and 100 mg at 36 hours after the surgery. The control group did not receive any diclofenac suppositories.; The results showed that the visual analogue score for pain in the study group was significantly less at 12, 18 and 24 hours after surgery (P <0.05). The amount of pethidine consumed was also significantly less (P <0.05) with 28 injections consumed in the study group as compared with 52 in the control group (each pethidine injection = 100 mg). The incidence of sedation and constipation was significantly less (P<0.05) in the study group.

The newborn and critically ill children are especially vulnerable to no treatment or under-treatment. Nerve pathways essential for the transmission and perception of pain are present and functioning by 24 weeks of gestation. The failure to provide analgesia for pain results in rewiring the nerve pathways responsible for pain transmission in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and results in increased pain perception for future painful results. Many children would withdraw or deny their pain in an attempt to avoid yet another terrifying and painful experiences, such as the intramuscular injections. Societal fears of opioid addiction and lack of advocacy are also causal factors in the under-treatment of pediatric pain. False beliefs about addictions and proper use of acetaminophen and other analgesics resulted in the failure to provide analgesia to children. All children even the newborn and critically ill require analgesia for pain and painful procedures.

New pain occurred in 33 (73.3%) of 45 patients. Pathological conditions of tissue demonstrated on imaging corresponded to new pain in eight patients, referred pain in five, and neither of these in 15 patients. New pain was centered opposite the site of the original pain in a mirror-image location in 28 patients and rostral to the original pain in five patients. It was temporary in seven patients, weaker than the original pain in 25, and as severe as the original pain in one patient. The incidence of moderate or severe pain was significantly higher in patients with confirmed tissue disease (six of eight patients) than in those without (six of 20 patients). An important contributing factor to the occurrence of new pain was the achievement of analgesia by performing the cordotomy.; The present results indicate that new pain occurs frequently after unilateral cordotomy. Nonetheless, cordotomy may still be indicated for unilateral uncontrollable pain because new pain, when present, was weaker and more easily controlled than the original pain in nearly all cases. The authors speculate that new pain may represent a type of referred pain from the original painful area or may arise from sensitization of contralateral spinal nociceptive circuits due to metastasis or tumor infiltration, and that new pain is potentiated by the interruption of descending inhibitory pathways.",E,E

11587108,A biopsychosocial overview of pretreatment screening of patients with pain.,Humans; Narcotics; Pain; Palliative Care; Psychology,"Gatchel, R J","The prevalence and excessive cost of pain, especially when the pain becomes chronic, remains a major health-care problem in the United States. Currently, a biopsychosocial perspective of pain has been found to be the most heuristic approach to understanding and managing it. Using this perspective, an important advance has been made in the possibility of individually tailoring treatment for each patient, with the result being better outcomes. The author reviews the extant literature demonstrating a robust ""psychosocial disability factor"" among injured workers that is important not only in pain perception, but also in the subsequent development of chronic pain-related disability. Such results emphasize the importance of taking into account how psychosocial and physical factors are intertwined in a complex way in determining pain symptomatology. On the basis of these findings, a number of surgical pre-screening approaches have been developed and found to be effective for maximizing surgical outcomes as described by Carragee, Epker, and Block in other papers in this special topics series. Recently, several organizations in the U.S. have also developed new standards for the evaluation of pain. For example, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Organizations (JCAHO) now requires that physicians consider pain as a ""5th vital sign"" in evaluating patients. Such initiatives have created a new mandate to regularly assess and manage all types of pain. The use of opioids, as well as implantable pain-management modalities, are among the options. The author notes that the literature on these modalities focuses on interdisciplinary patient-screening approaches prior to their administration as a way of maximizing treatment outcomes. The papers by Praeger, Jacobs, and Robinson et al. in this special topics series describe the approach to pretreatment assessment for these modalities in detail. Finally, the author presents a stepwise, biopsychosocial approach as the basis for assessment before decisions regarding surgery, opioid maintenance therapy, and implantable pain-management modalities. The author suggests that systematic pretreatment interventions will facilitate a more structured standard of care in the evaluation and treatment of patients with pain and ultimately better outcomes.",E,E

Pain relief (scale, 0 = none to 4 = complete) and pain intensity (scale, 0 = none to 3 = severe) were measured 30 minutes and then hourly for 6 hours after the first daily dose each week. Patients and investigators assessed the efficacy (scale, 1 = poor to 5 = excellent) of each medication, and patients recorded daily doses of study and rescue medications.; A total of 462 patients (mean age, 57.6 years) were randomly assigned to treatment, with 112 (24%) reporting chronic low back pain, 162 (35%) reporting OA pain, and 188 (41%) reporting both low back and OA pain; 309 patients (67%) received tramadol/APAP and 153 (33%) received codeine/APAP. Pain relief and changes in pain intensity were comparable from day 1, as early as 30 minutes after the first dose, and lasted for at least 6 hours. Total pain relief scores (11.9 for tramadol/APAP; 11.4 for codeine/APAP) and sum of pain intensity differences (3.8 for tramadol/APAP; 3.3 for codeine/APAP) were also comparable throughout. Overall assessments of efficacy by patients (mean score 2.9 in each treatment group) and investigators (mean score 3.0 for tramadol/APAP, 2.9 for codeine/APAP) were similar for the 2 treatment groups. Equivalent mean doses (3.5 tablets or capsules daily) and maximum daily doses (5.5 tablets or 5.7 capsules) were used in the 2 treatment groups. The overall incidence of adverse events was comparable, with a significantly higher proportion of patients in the codeine/APAP group reporting somnolence (24% [37/153] vs 17% [54/309], P = 0.05) or constipation (21% [32/153] vs 11% [35/309], P < 0.01) and a larger proportion of patients in the tramadol/APAP group reporting headache (11% [34/309] vs 7% [11/153], P = 0.08).; The results of this study suggest that tramadol/APAP tablets (37.5 mg/325 mg) are as effective as codeine/ APAP capsules (30 mg/300 mg) in the treatment of chronic nonmalignant low back pain and OA pain and are better tolerated.",E,E

Patient evaluations of pain intensity, pain relief, and global assessments were recorded throughout the 24-hour period after dosing. The 2-stopwatch method was used to determine time to confirmed perceptible pain relief. The primary end point assessing overall analgesic effect was total pain relief over 6 hours (TOPAR6). Secondary end points were patient global assessment of response to therapy (PGART) at 6 hours, onset of analgesia, peak analgesic effect, and duration of analgesia.; A total of 393 patients were enrolled; 182 received rofecoxib, 180 received codeine/acetaminophen, and 31 received placebo. The overall analgesic effect of rofecoxib 50 mg was greater than that of codeine 60 mg/acetaminophen 600 mg for TOPAR6 (12.4 vs 7.0; P < 0.001) and PGART at 6 hours (P < 0.001). The onset of analgesic effect was similar for rofecoxib and codeine/acetaminophen. Peak analgesic effect as measured by peak pain relief scores during the first 6 hours was significantly greater in the rofecoxib group compared with the codeine/acetaminophen group (P < 0.001), as was the duration of analgesic effect measured by the time to rescue analgesia (9.6 hours vs 2.3 hours, P < 0.001). Adverse events were reported in 33.0%, 46.1%, and 32.3% of patients treated with rofecoxib, codeine/acetaminophen, and placebo, respectively.

This study prospectively evaluates the long-term efficacy of SPL in pancreatitis patients.; Chronic pancreatitis patients with severe pain unrelieved by standard therapy completed a standard 10-point analogue pain scale prior to surgery and at postoperative visits. Midline and left-sided pain was treated with left SPL; right-sided pain was treated with right SPL. If pain recurred on the contralateral side, contralateral SPL was done.; Fifteen patients underwent SPL. Eleven of them required narcotics preoperatively. Follow-up is complete and ranges from 4.2 to 6.1 years (median, 5.75). All patients had constant pain prior to surgery. Following SPL, it decreased in the short term to a mean of 3.9 attacks a month. At long-term follow-up, the mean number of attacks was 8.6 per month. Preoperatively, the mean score for worst pain within the last 2 months was 9.1. This score decreased to 3.9, but at long-term follow-up it had increased to near preoperative values (8.6). Current severity of pain decreased from 7.2 preoperatively to 2.9 at short-term follow-up, but at long-term follow-up it had increased. The degree of disability decreased from 9.1 preoperatively to 5.1 at short-term follow-up, but in the long term it increased toward preoperative values. Although eight patients were narcotic free at early follow-up, only three remained narcotic free in the long-term.; Thoracoscopic SPL offers short-term relief of pain from chronic pancreatitis, but the relief is not durable in most cases. Similarly, there are short-term improvements in degree of disability, mood, and freedom from narcotic use that are not sustained in the long-term. Nevertheless, two-thirds of patients stated that they would have the surgery again.",E,E

Recent case studies suggest that its use as an analgesic could be extended to non-cancer pain, especially neuropathic pain. The present case study reports, for the first time, the efficacy of methadone in a burn patient experiencing neuropathic pain in his healed wounds. The patient sustained extensive (55% total body surface area) chemical burns and developed chronic burning sensations, particularly in the lower limbs where skin grafting had been performed. Conventional pharmacotherapies against neuropathic pain were attempted to control pain for over 5 years. The agents used included long- and short-acting opioids, amitriptyline, clonazepam, and gabapentin, but they all failed to relieve the pain. When methadone (5 mg every 12 h) was introduced, it significantly alleviated the patient's pain within a few days of administration. The patient has now been taking methadone (15 mg every 12 h) for 10 months and reports that the opioid caused 70% pain relief and a 55% amelioration in his quality of life. Although these results are based on a case report, they suggest that a switch to methadone might be useful in some burn patients who have developed chronic neuropathic pain unrelieved by conventional pharmacotherapies. Methadone, however, needs to be titrated with vigilance and thus should be administered by a physician experienced with its use in the treatment of chronic pain.",E,E

They were then assessed for onset of sensory and motor block and the VbAS score for tourniquet pain.; Although more patients in group B had a faster onset of sensory and motor block, this was not significantly different. Patients in group B had a significantly lower VbAS score 30 min after tourniquet inflation and after change over to the distal tourniquet (P < 0.05). There were no complaints of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Two patients in group B developed localised skin urticaria of the forearm which resolved with the release of the tourniquet.; There is a positive trend that tramadol might improve the quality of intravenous regional anaesthesia.",E,E

The aims of this prospective randomized study were to investigate the effect of local anesthesia and to discover whether it is cost effective.; For this study, 100 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized into two groups. The 43 study patients were injected with 0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride at the trocar site before the trocars were inserted. They then were compared with 41 control patients who received no local anesthesia. The remaining 16 patients were excluded from the study. The postoperative pain was evaluated at the standard four trocar sites at 4 h and 24 h after surgery on a scale 1 (the mildest pain the patient had ever experienced) to 10 (the most severe pain the patient had ever experienced). Postoperative pain medications and their cost were evaluated.; There was no difference between the two groups with regard to gender, age, weight, operative time, estimated operative blood loss, and bile culture. The patients who received bupivacaine at the trocar site clinically had less pain (p < 0.001 for all four sites) both at 4 and 24 h after surgery. The treatment group patients used less mepiridine and promethzine than the control group (p = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively) postoperatively. Overall, the patients who had local anesthesia used less postoperative pain and antiemetic medication than the control patients (p = 0.02). This afforded a significant decrease in the costs and charges of these medications (p = 0.004 and 0.005, respectively). Three patients in the study group were discharged from the hospital the day of surgery.; Preinsertion of local anesthesia at the trocar site in laparoscopic cholecystectomy significantly reduces postoperative pain and decreases medication usage costs.",E,E

It has analgesic activity suitable for mild to moderate pain, part of its analgesic activity being modulated via mu receptors. Adult studies have raised the question of increased electroencephalographic activity. The study examined the analgesic efficacy, respiratory effects, and behavior plus recovery-influencing properties of tramadol in the pediatric patient. Day-case dental extraction children, aged 4-7 years having 6 or more extractions, were studied. Tramadol drops, 3 mg/kg, plus oral midazolam, 0.5 mg/kg, were administered 30 minutes prior to a sevoflurane in N2O and O2 anesthetic. Forty children received this premedication treatment (T) and 10 entered a placebo control group (P), where no tramadol was administered. Entry was random, double blind, and parallel. Analgesic efficacy was measured using the Oucher face pain scale (OFPS), with responders scoring three or less. Respiration was measured by rate and oxygen saturation. Behavior and ease of mask induction were assessed on a 4-point scale. Recovery was measured with the Aldrete scale. Parameters were measured from 30 minute preanesthetic to 120 minute postanesthetic. Analgesic efficacy was shown, with an OFPS score of 11.42 (SD 18.66) (T) and 29.80 (SD 25.14) (P) (P < .05). Responders on tramadol were 77.5% versus 0% on placebo (P < .05). No respiratory depression was seen; rates and oxygen saturations were the same preanesthetic and postanesthetic. Similarly, the two groups had no cardiovascular differences. Preanesthetic behavior patterns were the same (P > .05), with 85% of the tramadol group being drowsy but awake versus 90% in the placebo group. Similarly satisfactory induction behavior was seen in 95% of the tramadol group and 90% of the placebo group. Recovery times were 48.6 minutes (SD 32.3) (T) and 43.1 minutes (SD 32.5) (P) (P > .05). It is concluded that tramadol at 3 mg/kg has no clinical respiratory depressant effect and that behavior and recovery times are unaffected. Analgesic efficacy is demonstrated.",E,E

No patient received pre-procedure narcotics or sedation. Pain associated with biopsy was determined using a horizontal linear visual analog pain scale. Pain scores in the 2 treatment groups were compared and possible predictors of increased pain were examined.; The 2 groups were similar in demographic characteristics. There was no significant difference in pain score in the 2% lidocaine and lubricant alone groups (28.3 versus 28.9 mm., p = 0.88). Previous biopsy, time since previous biopsy, physician, number of biopsies and prostate volume did not correlate with pain score, while age correlated negatively with the score (r = -0.27, p = 0.005). A single complication involving a vasovagal episode resolved spontaneously.; Intrarectal lidocaine gel provides no significant therapeutic or analgesic benefit compared with lubricant alone for transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate.

11698029,Opioids in chronic pain.,"Animals; Chronic Disease; Humans; Narcotic Antagonists; Narcotics; Opioid Peptides; Pain; Receptors, Opioid","Przew艂ocki, R; Przew艂ocka, B","The advance in our understanding of the biogenesis of various endogenous opioid peptides, their anatomical distribution, and the characteristics of the multiple receptors with which they interact open a new avenue for understanding the role of opioid peptide systems in chronic pain. The main groups of opioid peptides: enkephalins, dynorphins and beta-endorphin derive from proenkephalin, prodynorphin and proopiomelanocortin, respectively. Recently, a novel group of peptides has been discovered in the brain and named endomorphins, endomorphin-1 and -2. They are unique in comparison with other opioid peptides by atypical structure and high selectivity towards the mu-opioid receptor. Another group, which joined the endogenous opioid peptide family in the last few years is the pronociceptin system comprising the peptides derived from this prohormone, acting at ORL1 receptors. Three members of the opioid receptor family were cloned in the early 1990s, beginning with the mouse delta-opioid receptor (DOR1) and followed by cloning of mu-opioid receptor (MOR1) and kappa-opioid receptor (KOR1). These three receptors belong to the family of seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors, and share extensive structural homologies. These opioid receptor and peptide systems are significantly implicated in antinociceptive processes. They were found to be represented in the regions involved in nociception and pain. The effects of opioids in animal models of inflammatory pain have been studied in great detail. Inflammation in the periphery influences the central sites and changes the opioid action. Inflammation increased spinal potency of various opioid receptor agonists. In general, the antinociceptive potency of opioids is greater against various noxious stimuli in animals with peripheral inflammation than in control animals. Inflammation-induced enhancement of opioid antinociceptive potency is characteristic predominantly for mu opioid receptors, since morphine elicits a greater increase in spinal potency of mu- than of delta- and kappa-opioid receptor agonists. Enhancement of the potency of mu-opioid receptor agonists during inflammation could arise from the changes occurring in opioid receptors, predominantly in affinity or number of the mu-opioid receptors. Inflammation has been shown to alter the expression of several genes in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Several studies have demonstrated profound alterations in the spinal PDYN system when there is peripheral inflammation or chronic arthritis. Endogenous dynorphin biosynthesis also increases under various conditions associated with neuropathic pain following damage to the spinal cord and injury of peripheral nerves. Interestingly, morphine lacks potent analgesic efficacy in neuropathic pain. A vast body of clinical evidence suggests that neuropathic pain is not opioid-resistant but only that reduced sensitivity to systemic opioids is observed in this condition, and an increase in their dose is necessary in order to obtain adequate analgesia. Reduction of morphine antinociceptive potency was postulated to be due to the fact that nerve injury reduced the activity of spinal opioid receptors or opioid signal transduction. Our recent study with endogenous ligands of the mu-opioid receptor, endomorphins, further complicates the issue, since endomorphins appear to be effective in neuropathic pain. Identification of the involved differences may be of importance to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of opioid action in neuropathic pain, as well as to the development of better and more effective drugs for the treatment of neuropathic pain in humans.",E,E

To conclude an older comparative series, it was the aim of the present study to define analgesic potency, side effects and patient acceptance of hydromorphone and its interaction with the non-opioid analgesic metamizole. A total of 120 patients recovering from elective abdominal or orthopaedic surgery, performed under standardised general anaesthesia, were randomised into 3 double-blind treatment groups to receive intravenous PCA demand doses of hydromorphone 283 micrograms (low dose, LD), 566 micrograms (high dose, HD) or a combination of hydromorphone 283 micrograms and metamizole 50 mg (low dose hydromorphone + metamizole, LM). Demand-independent low-dose background infusions were added to deliver hydromorphone at 67.9 micrograms/h in all groups, with additional metamizole at 12 mg/h in group LM. Lockout times were set to 2 min. After an average observation time of 24.5 +/- 2.6 h (mean, SD) since start of PCA, cumulative PCA hydromorphone doses in groups LD, HD and LM were 7.8 +/- 3.3, 12.1 +/- 4.8 and 7.5 +/- 2.0 mg, respectively, with the well known large inter-individual variability in all groups. Although hydromorphone consumption was significantly higher in group HD, self-reported pain intensities (VAS, retrospective pain scores) were quite comparable between the groups. Low dose, PCA bolus-linked metamizole did not significantly reduce hydromorphone consumption nor improve patient acceptance. Side-effects were typical for potent postoperative opioids, but never required special treatment; haemodynamic or respiratory complications were not observed in any patient. It can be concluded by comparison with other PCA opioid investigations performed under the same study protocol that hydromorphone is about 3-4 times as potent an analgesic as morphine under the conditions of intravenous postoperative PCA. Due to a favourable patient acceptance, hydromorphone can be recommended as a suitable alternative to other opioids for the treatment of postoperative pain.",E,E

The initial painful stimulation of nerve endings by the burn with continued painful stimuli result in peripheral and central mechanisms causing amplification of painful stimuli, and the development of chronic pain syndromes that can be difficult to treat. In order to assess the effect of analgesic interventions it is essential to measure the patient's pain in a simple and reproducible manner. A number of tools exist for this measurement, ranging from longer and more detailed techniques such as the McGill pain questionnaire most suited to relatively stable pain, to visual analogue scores and picture-based scores for children. Pain management begins with the acute injury, with initial measures such as cooling of the burn and use of inhalational agents such as oxygen/nitrous oxide mixtures. On arrival in hospital, for any but trivial burns, intravenous opioids are appropriate and should be administered as small intravenous boluses titrated against effect. Following the initial resuscitation, pain may be divided into background pain and that associated with procedures. These often require different analgesic interventions. Background pain may be treated with potent intravenous opioids by infusion or patient controlled analgesia and then on to oral, less potent opioids, followed by other oral analgesics. Often drug combinations work best. More severe procedural pain may be treated with a variety of interventions from a slight increase in therapy for the background pain to more potent drugs, local blocks, or general anaesthesia. In addition to drug-based methods of managing burn pain, a number of nonpharmacologic approaches have been successfully employed including hypnosis, auricular electrical stimulation, massage, and a number of cognitive and behavioural techniques.",E,E

A thorough history is the best clue to the multifactorial causes of the pain, superimposed upon an understanding of the complex innervation network that supplies the kidneys. The appropriate use of diagnostic radiology (especially MRI) will assist in differentiating the mechanical low back pain caused by cyst enlargement, cyst rupture and cyst infection. Also, the increased incidence of uric acid nephrolithiasis as a factor in producing renal colic must be considered when evaluating acute pain in the population at risk. MRI is not a good technique to detect renal calculi, a frequent cause of pain in polycystic kidney disease. If stone disease is a possibility, then abdominal CT scan and/or ultrasound should be the method of radiologic investigation. Pain management is generally not approached in a systematic way in clinical practice because most physicians lack training in the principles of pain management. The first impulse to give narcotics for pain relief must be avoided.

As shown in previous studies, nurses may be more influenced by the patient's behavior than the patient's self-report of pain, especially in relation to decisions about opioid titration. Nurses are less likely to increase a previously safe but ineffective dose of opioid for a smiling patient than a grimacing patient. Survey results reveal a tendency for nurses' personal opinions about the patients' pain, rather than their recorded assessments, to influence choice of opioid dose and to contribute to undertreatment of pain.",E,E

Surgical procedures included abdominal hysterectomy, oophorectomy, and laparotomy. Average pain was moderate on both days, but paired t tests indicated that pain increased significantly during ambulation on day 1 (P = .009, sensation; P < .001, distress) and on day 2 (P = .007, sensation; P = .030, distress). They both (P = .001) decreased significantly during rest on day 1, but not on day 2. Analysis of quartiles indicated that one fourth of the sample suffered severe sensation pain at all points on day 1 (60 to 74 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale), and moderate to severe sensation on day 2 (40 to 60 mm). The lowest quartile had mild pain on both days (11 to 28 mm on day 1, and 7 to 14 mm on day 2). Some patients (30%) reported that pain interrupted their sleep on the first 2 nights, and difficulty sleeping on the first postoperative night for any reason (65%) was related to greater pain during the next 2 days (r = .25 to .43). Although 41% of the women had previously used relaxation techniques for stress or pain, only 9% used it for pain after surgery.

This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was designed to determine whether oral (p.o.) lorazepam and hydromorphone reduces pain and anxiety during BMBA. Eligible patients had lymphoma, had no prior BMBA, and were > or = 18 years old. Since patients had bilateral BMBA, each served as their own control. Patients were stratified by anxiety level using the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Scale and randomized to: A) placebo for the first BMBA and 2 mg lorazepam and 2 mg hydromorphone p.o. for the contralateral BMBA, or B) placebo for both BMBAS. Changes in pain and anxiety experienced between the first and second BMBA were measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Spielberger State Anxiety Scale at the time of the BMBA and 24 hours later. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled and 25 were evaluable; there were 17 males and eight females. The median age was 57 years (range, 28-79 years). Overall, BMBA was reported as painful in both arms, with a median VAS pain score after the second BMBA of 3.9 (scale, 0-10) for arm A and 5.8 for arm B (P = 0.21). There was no difference in the change in pain, anxiety, or recalled anxiety between treatment arms (all P values > 0.05). The difference in the change in recalled pain was of borderline significance (P = 0.07) and consistent with benzodiazepine-induced anterograde amnesia.",E,E

Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy are the mainstays of OA analgesia, but other drug and non-drug therapy, joint injections, and surgery may be needed to provide reasonable quality of life. Regularly scheduled, low-dose opioids can produce good relief of chronic nonmalignant pain including pain caused by OA.

Professional education is used as the means to translate knowledge into practice. Outcomes measurement is the gold standard for validating improvement. This study used an educational intervention to transfer knowledge on implementing a previously tested algorithm for cancer pain management into community outpatient oncology clinics and, subsequently, measuring patient outcomes. Physicians and nurses from 9 Puget Sound clinics were randomized by institution blocks to either ""training"" or ""no training."" Role model physician/nurse teams were the core faculty for a day-long seminar. Written reference materials and documentation tools were provided to the trained physician/nurse teams. A total of 105 patients of trained and untrained providers were accrued and assessed over 4 months. Patients of trained providers had a significant reduction in usual pain over the 4 months of data collection compared with patients of untrained providers (t = 2.0; p = .05). Improvements were modest in the prescription of opioid analgesics and dramatic in the prescription of co-analgesics for neuropathic pain. There was a clear deterioration in the impact of the training over time. The most significant effect occurred within the first 140 days after the intervention and was followed by a gradual return to baseline practice. In conclusion, algorithmic interventions can be successfully transferred into community practice, but further work must be performed to develop methods for securing retention of knowledge and maintaining improved outcomes.",E,E

Nerve lateralization holds even higher risks from epineurial damage or ischaemic stretching. Neuropathy from implant compression and drill punctures can result in neuroma formation of all types, and in some cases precipitate centralized pain syndrome. Two patterns of clinical neuropathy are seen to result; hypoaesthesias with impaired sensory function, often seen with phantom pain, and hyperaesthesias with minimal sensory impairment but presence of much-evoked pain phenomena. The clinician must differentiate, through careful patient questioning and stimulus-response testing, those patients who are undergoing satisfactory spontaneous nerve recovery from those who are developing dysfunctional or dysaesthetic syndromes. Acute nerve injuries are treated with fixture and nerve decompression and combined with supportive anti-inflammatory, narcotic and anti-convulsant therapy. Surgical exploration, neuroma resection and microsurgical repair, with or without nerve grafting, are indicated when unsatisfactory spontaneous sensory return has been demonstrated, and in the presence of function impairment and intractable pain.",E,E

Analgesics are usually only partially effective, and the use of narcotics such as codeine is often poorly tolerated because of associated nausea. Because the pain associated with tonsillectomy is believed to arise from the large areas of exposed parapharyngeal muscle, we hypothesized that acellular dermal grafting of the peritonsillar fossa, providing biologic coverage to these areas, would result in a notable reduction of postoperative pain.; We did a double-blind, prospective study, with 10 adult patients undergoing electrodissection tonsillectomy concurrently with grafting of 1 peritonsillar fossa with an acellular dermal graft (ADG) (AlloDerm, LifeCell Corp, The Woodlands, TX), whereas the other side of the throat received no treatment and was designated as the control side. Patients were examined on postoperative days 1, 7, and 14, and completed pain questionnaires on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14.; ADG grafting of the peritonsillar fossa resulted in a statistically significant reduction in pain (by approximately 50%) on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, and 7, compared with the control side. Two patients experienced partial graft sloughing within the first 10 postoperative days, but no other untoward effects such as bleeding, graft aspiration, or infection, were associated with ADG of the peritonsillar fossa.; This study suggests that AlloDerm grafting of the peritonsillar fossa is a potentially useful, alternative means of reducing pain in the adult tonsillectomy patient and has potential use in reconstruction of oropharyngeal defects. Because of the cost of the graft, we suggest its use in selected difficult adult cases, but not as part of routine adult tonsillectomy.",E,E

A meta-analysis was performed of 3 separate single-dose, double-blind, parallel-group trials in patients with moderate or severe pain following extraction of 2 or more third molars. Patients in each study were evenly randomized to a single dose of tramadol/APAP (75 mg/650 mg), tramadol 75 mg, APAP 650 mg, ibuprofen 400 mg, or placebo. Active control with ibuprofen was used to determine model sensitivity. Pain relief (scale, 0-4) and pain intensity (scale, 0-3) were reported at 30 minutes after the dose and then hourly for 8 hours. Total pain relief over 8 hours (TOTPAR8) and the sum of pain intensity differences (SPID8) were calculated from the hourly scores. Time to onset of pain relief was determined by the double-stopwatch technique, and patients were advised to wait at least 2 hours before taking supplemental analgesia. Patients assessed overall efficacy (scale, 1-5) upon completion. In all, 1197 patients (age range, 16-46 years) were evaluable for efficacy; treatment groups in each study were similar at baseline. Pain relief was superior to placebo (P < or = .0001) for all treatments. Pain relief provided by tramadol/ APAP was superior to that of tramadol or APAP alone, as shown by mean TOT-PAR8 (12.1 vs 6.7 and 8.6, respectively, P < or = .0001) and SPID8 (4.7 vs 0.9 and 2.7, respectively, P < or = .0001). Estimated onset of pain relief was 17 minutes (95% CI, 15-20 minutes) for tramadol/APAP compared with 51 minutes (95% CI, 40-70 minutes) for tramadol, 18 minutes (95% CI, 16-21 minutes) for APAP, and 34 minutes (95% CI, 28-44 minutes) for ibuprofen. Median time to supplemental analgesia and mean overall assessment of efficacy were greater (P < .05) for the tramadol/APAP group (302 minutes and 3.0, respectively) than for the tramadol (122 minutes and 2.0) or APAP (183 minutes and 2.7) monotherapy groups. A new combination analgesic, tramadol/APAP, is superior to tramadol or APAP alone with respect to pain relief and duration of action.

This randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study included a screening visit, a treatment visit, and a follow-up visit 1 week after treatment. Recordings of visual analog scales (VAS) pain intensity scores at maximum mouth opening (main efficacy variable) and at jaw rest were made directly before a 1-ml i.a. injection into one TMJ of either 1.0mg morphine-HCl, 0.1mg morphine-HCl, or saline (placebo). The pain intensity was also recorded at the follow-up and in a diary 3 days before and 5 days after the injection. The VAS pain score at maximum mouth opening was considerably reduced 1-10h after injection but without significant differences between groups. At the follow-up, the median VAS pain score at maximal mouth opening was significantly lower in the 0.1-mg morphine group than in the 1.0-mg morphine group (P<0.043) or the saline group (P<0.021). A significant increase in pain pressure threshold over the affected joint was seen in the 0.1-mg morphine group compared with the saline group at the follow-up but not 1 and 2h post-injection. The incidence of adverse events was small and did not differ between the treatment groups. In conclusion, one i.a. injection of 0.1mg morphine significantly increased the pain pressure threshold and mouth opening ability, but evidence for the analgesic property of the locally applied opioid was inconclusive. No dose-effect relation and no significant short-term analgesic property were seen. Although statistically significant, the magnitude of the reduced VAS pain intensity score was not clinically relevant at the 1-week follow-up.",E,E

A conversion ratio of 25 microg/hour of fentanyl to 0.1 mg/hour of methadone was used to calculate the initial dose of methadone in all patients.; Mean pain scores decreased from 8.1 to 4.8 on Day 1 after the switch and to 3.22 on Day 4 after the switch. Mean sedation scores were 1.5 before the switch and 0.44 and 0.16 on Days 1 and 4, respectively. Among the 6 patients who experienced confusion while on fentanyl before the switch, 5 improved within 2 days of the switch. None of the patients experienced toxicity from methadone.; On the basis of this preliminary study, the authors suggest that when switching from intravenous fentanyl to methadone a conversion ratio of 25 microg/hour of fentanyl to 0.1 mg/hour of methadone may be safe and effective.",E,E

Research using different ligands, cell lines, and animal models in the past three decades has elucidated some correlation between the biochemical events and behavioral changes resulting from opioid tolerance, dependence and addiction. For the most part, opioid tolerance and dependence are associated with up-regulation of the cAMP pathway, mediated by the supersensitization of adenylyl cyclase and by the altered coupling of opioid receptors to stimulatory G proteins. Neuroadaptive changes in signal transduction following prolonged opioid exposure are mediated by protein kinase systems, such as protein kinase C (PKC), cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), Ca2+/camodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Intermediate steps between opioid receptor activation and the second- or third-messenger cascades include GRK-mediated receptor endocytosis and intracellular trafficking, as well as interactions with excitatory amino acid receptors and regulation of nitric oxide synthesis. Thus, prolonged occupancy by opioid receptor agonists can have differential effects on opioid receptor internalization, down-regulation and desensitization, and in the supersensitization of adenylyl cyclase, which contribute to the development of opioid tolerance and dependence. We discuss the role of various protein kinases in the signaling mechanisms underlying these differences. Clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms of opioid tolerance and dependence will help in the treatment of patients suffering from acute and chronic pain, or drug dependence and addiction.",E,E

Each bolus of patient-controlled sedation delivered 4.8 mg propofol and 12 microg alfentenil. Music was provided by means of a portable compact disc machine with headphones. Outcome measures assessed immediately after colonoscopy and 24 hours later included dose of patient-controlled sedation used, complications, recovery time, pain score, satisfaction score, and willingness to repeat the procedure with the same mode of sedation.; The mean (SD) dose of propofol used in Group 1 was significantly less than Group 2 (0.84 mg/kg [0.69 mg/kg] vs. 1.15 mg/kg [0.83 mg/kg]; p = 0.02, t test).

This is in large part because of the relative paucity of randomized clinical trials and the scarcity of comparative studies with different drugs. Clinical studies on the efficacy of a drug or a technique are generally referred to the pathologic diagnosis and not to the pain mechanism. We have learned from animal models the different pain mechanisms which may be involved in the peripheral nerves and the spinal cord. Unfortunately, one mechanism could be responsible for many different symptoms, while the same symptom can be caused by different mechanisms. The authors propose a simple model to evaluate the patients in order to define the mechanisms involved an to select the treatment strategy. The diagnostic model allows classification of the patient into four groups according to pain mechanism (spinal neurons sensitization due to deafferentation, ectopic discharges in peripheral nociceptive C fibers, spinal neurons sensitization due to ectopic discharges in peripheral nociceptive C fibers, spinal neurons sensitization due to nociceptors sensitization). The authors propose also a second step in which a fifth mechanism, adrenosensitivity, is evaluated. Treatment options may target any of the mechanisms discussed. Drugs and analgesic techniques can be classified according to their action on pain mechanisms. The authors identify in the literature some drugs and techniques which can be tested in each defined groups. A complementary and multidisciplinary rehabilitative approach of chronic pain patients is recommended.",E,E

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to determine whether prophylactic nalmefene could decrease side effects of intrathecal morphine given during cesarean section, without affecting analgesia. Sixty parturients were given 0.25 mg of intrathecal morphine, 12.5 micrograms of fentanyl, and 11.25 to 15 mg of bupivacaine. A dose of 0.25 microgram/kg of nalmefene or placebo was given by intravenous piggyback immediately after delivery of the neonate. Nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and level of sedation were assessed for a 24-hour period using a 4-point ordinal scoring system. Pain was assessed by using a 0- to 10-point verbal analogue scale. A 5-point analgesic satisfaction survey also was completed. Subjects who received nalmefene required supplemental analgesia at a median of 6.00 hours after intrathecal morphine, compared with 14.12 hours in the placebo group (P = .037). No differences were found between the groups in the incidence of pruritus, nausea and vomiting, level of sedation, or analgesic satisfaction. We concluded that nalmefene at a dose of 0.25 microgram/kg does not decrease the incidence of side effects but increases the need for supplemental analgesics.",E,E

The pain is characterized by a burning or stinging sensation similar to neuropathic pain sensations. The purpose of the present study was to compare the analgesic effect of a tricyclic antidepressant (TC), commonly used in the treatment of neuropathic pain, with the effect of opioids on radiation-induced mucositis pain. Forty-three patients receiving 66-68 Gy external radiation according to the DAHANCA guidelines (the Danish Head and Neck Cancer Study Group) were randomized to either morphine or TC when mucositis pain was insufficiently managed with weak analgesics. Patients with insufficient pain control in either treatment arm received supplementary medication from the opposite treatment arm. Pain was evaluated weekly using a VAS scale and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. The degree of mucositis and the degree of depression were measured at the same time intervals. Twenty-two patients entered the opioid arm and 21 the TC arm. Two patients in each arm were non-evaluable. VAS pain scores were significantly reduced in the opioid treatment arm one week after randomization (p = 0.01). Eight patients in the TC arm were managed with TC alone, but for 11 patients it was necessary to add morphine. The 20 evaluable patients in the morphine arm required no additional treatment. There were no significant differences in side effects between the two groups. Higher pain scores in the TC arm, but not in the opioid arm, were significantly correlated with higher BDI scores. Some head and neck cancer patients with radiation-induced nucositis pain may have sufficient pain control on TC alone. This might be useful in patients with relative counter-indications to opioid treatment.",E,E

In 36 of 51 patients who accepted the procedure, an epidural catheter was inserted (L1-L2 level). General anesthesia was induced with propofol and sufentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane in O2/N2O. After emergence from anesthesia, epidural analgesia was initiated according to two randomly assigned protocols: 1 mg of morphine with 75 microg of clonidine (Group M) or 12.5 mg of bupivacaine with 75 microg of clonidine (Group B), in 10 mL saline. Piritramide was administered during the first postoperative 24 hours using a patient-controlled analgesia device (PCA). The following parameters were recorded: piritramide consumption during the first 24 hours; pain at rest during the first postoperative hours (D0), during the first night (D1), and during the first mobilization; [visual analogue scale (VAS)]; and the occurrence of drowsiness, motor blockade, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, itching, micturition problems, and bladder catheterization during D0 and D1. Epidural administration of morphine-clonidine significantly improved postoperative pain relief and reduced piritramide consumption as compared to epidural bupivacaine-clonidine. Side effects did not differ between groups except for a higher incidence of micturition problems in Group M during D1. The occurrence of bladder catheterization was not significantly higher in that group. We conclude that a low dose of epidural morphine combined with clonidine offers a better postoperative analgesia than does bupivacaine-clonidine. The excellent analgesic conditions were obtained at the expense of a higher incidence of difficulties in initiating micturition.",E,E

One patient developed evidence of chronic lung disease; while the others remained well between episodes. Lung biopsies showed the acute stage of DAD in 3, overlapping acute and organizing stages in 3, and the organizing stage in 2. A definite cause was not identifiable in any. However, 4 had been treated with narcotics for chronic pain before the first episode, and 1 received this treatment before the recurrent episode. Three also were receiving psychotropic drugs for anxiety and depression. Five patients had evidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and/or hiatal hernia, 2 of whom underwent Nissen fundoplication in hopes of preventing future recurrences. Although a definite cause of the recurrent DAD was not identified, the findings suggest the possibility of a reaction to narcotics and/or psychotropic drugs in some patients, with a possible additional effect of GERD. A drug history should be carefully elicited in patients with recurrent DAD, and all potentially toxic drugs should be stopped.",E,E

The objective of the study was to further assess the efficacy of intramuscular droperidol for the treatment of acute migraine headache. The study design was a randomized, clinical trial set in a community-based ED. The population was a convenience sample of ED patients who met International Headache Society acute migraine criteria. Exclusions included pregnancy, use of narcotic or phenothiazine medications within 24 hours. For the protocol, patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Patients and physicians were blinded as to the treatment provided. Patients recorded their initial pain on a 100mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Patients were randomized to receive either 2.5 mg droperidol intramuscularly; the other group received 1.5 mg/kg meperidine intramuscularly. After 30 minutes patients recorded their pain on the VAS and recorded their preference for the medication on a Likert Scale. Physicians recorded the incidence of any side effects and the need for rescue medication. Statistical analysis consisted of categorical variables that were analyzed by chi-square, continuous interval data by t-tests and ordinal data by Mann-Whitney U test. The primary outcome parameters were mean VAS score change and the percentage of patients who wanted to go home without rescue medication. The study had an 80% power to detect a 26 mm difference in the mean change in VAS between groups. Of the 29 patients who were enrolled, 15 received droperidol.

For the final years of these patients information on opioid-type prescriptions were recorded using the duplicates kept in the pharmacies. To assure data privacy the matching was performed in a cryptographic computer program installed on laptop computers.; A total 489 (453) prescriptions could be matched to 435 (421) deceased patients with cancer in 1993 (1996) in 92% of all pharmacies in Bremen. In 1996, 20% of the patients with cancer received at least one prescription, including 14.5% who received opioids for eight weeks or longer. Average morphine-equivalent for each treated patient was 3712 mg (median=462 mg). There was no trend in prescription prevalence and the proportion of prescribing medical practices. The proportion of patients who received opioids for longer periods increased 4%. However, among the treated patients the average morphine-equivalent increased 23%.; The prescription prevalence of opioids remains low among cancer patients in their final year of life. However, our study provides some evidence for positive developments with respect to prescription times and dosage between 1993 and 1996. These changes are likely due to a limited subgroup of practioners.",E,E

The following continuous introduction of new analgesics promised an end of pain as a bane of mankind. Reality, however, soon proved different. Today patients with chronic pain rather than those with acute pain are in the focus of pain therapy. Only since the beginning of interdisciplinary treatment including psychological and psychosomatic approaches progress has been achieved in chronic pain. The first specialised pain clinic opened by Bonica in the USA and the founding of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) have been milestones in the treatment of chronic pain. Today several associations and societies are active promoting both the needs of patients suffering from chronic pain and the needs of the professionals treating pain patients. Although recently physicians can qualify in specialised pain therapy there are still by far too few specialists to provide sufficient care for all chronic pain patients in Germany.",E,E

In all patients the inefficacy of opioids with regard to pain symptomatology could be demonstrated. Because the ICD-10 criteria of addiction cannot be fully applied to patients under opioid therapy because of chronic pain we suggest as criteria the intake of opioids because of positive psychotropic effects, the demand of high dosage of short acting opioids with inefficacy of similar long acting opioids dosage, the uncontrolled raising of dosage with illegal procurement and reluctance of the patient to stop opioid therapy because of proved inefficacy of pain control. These criteria applied 4% of all in-patients treated because of chronic pain and 30% of all in patients with somatoform pain disorder of our interdisciplinary unit fulfilled within two years the criteria of opioid therapy abuse. The risk of abuse of opioid therapy described in pain therapy literature for patients with substance abuse is also relevant for patients with somatoform pain disorder. Therefore a qualified psychotherapeutic evaluation before starting an opioid therapy for nonmalignant pain in order to exclude a somatoform pain disorder or to assess a substance dependency is mandatory. Patients with somatoform pain disorder should be treated with opioids only in clinical studies. A prior or present history of substance abuse given chronic opioid therapy for nonmalignant pain should only be performed in close cooperation of addiction- and pain therapists.",E,E

The prevailing practice was compared with an established standard guideline.; One-third (35%) of patients were receiving morphine. Several deficiencies in morphine prescribing were identified. These include omission of breakthrough morphine dosing, use of morphine as p.r.n. (when necessary) alone for chronic pain, absence of review after prescribing treatment, and lack of double dosing at night. Prophylactic laxative and anti-emetics were often not co-prescribed.; Despite much of what is known about the pharmacology and therapeutic use of morphine, there is much variation and even inappropriate prescription in a palliative care institution. Implementation of recommended European guidelines and education may improve morphine prescribing habits. However, such guidelines may have to be validated in future studies to see if they need to be revised to suit our local population.",E,E

Morphine is unique among opiates in its ability to activate the mu opioid receptor (MOR) without promoting its desensitization and endocytosis. Here we demonstrate that [D-Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-ol] enkephalin (DAMGO) can facilitate the ability of morphine to stimulate MOR endocytosis. As a consequence, rats treated chronically with both drugs show reduced analgesic tolerance compared to rats treated with morphine alone. These results demonstrate that endocytosis of the MOR can reduce the development of tolerance, and hence suggest an approach for the development of opiate analogs with enhanced efficacy for the treatment of chronic pain.",E,E

The recommended dosing of the study medications was 1 tablet every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 5 tablets per day. If adequate pain relief was not obtained, patients were permitted to take up to 4 doses per day of supplemental analgesic medication-the nonopioid component of the assigned study medication (ibuprofen 200 mg or acetaminophen 325 mg). Measures of efficacy included mean daily pain relief scores (0 = no relief, 1 = slight relief, 2 = moderate relief, 3 = good relief, and 4 = complete relief), mean daily number of tablets and doses of study medication, mean daily number of tablets and doses of supplemental analgesic medication, global evaluation (poor, fair, good, very good, or excellent), and results on the modified 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). All efficacy measures were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Tolerability was evaluated based on adverse events reported spontaneously or elicited by the in vestigators using nonsuggestive questioning, as well as on the number of patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events.; The study enrolled 147 patients (75 HC/IB, 72 OX/AC). The most common cause of low back pain was muscular/ligamentous injury (97/147; 66.0%), followed by degenerative disk disease (27/147; 18.4%). At baseline, 80 patients (54.4%) reported experiencing moderate pain, and 67 patients (45.6%) reported experiencing severe pain. There were no significant differences between HC/IB and OX/AC with regard to mean ( +/- SD) daily pain relief scores (2.40 +/- 1.06 vs 2.50 +/- 1.01, respectively), mean daily number of tablets of study medication (1.80 +/- 1.70 vs 2.20 +/- 1.60), mean daily number of doses of study medication (1.80 +/- 1.65 vs 2.10 +/- 1.58), mean daily number of tablets of supplemental analgesic medication (0.60 +/- 1.13 vs 0.50 +/- 0.99), mean daily number of doses of supplemental analgesic medication (0.60 +/- 1.07 vs 0.50 +/- 0.90), global evaluations, or mean scores on the modified SF-36. In addition, there were no significant differences in the proportion of patients experiencing adverse events with HC/IB (47; 62.7%) and OX/AC (45; 62.5%). Adverse events were consistent with those generally associated with the component analgesics and predominantly involved the central nervous system and gastrointestinal system.; The results of this study suggest that HC/IB and OX/AC are similarly effective and tolerable in relieving moderate or severe acute low back pain. Additional controlled longitudinal trials are necessary to evaluate the clinical utility of HC/IB in treating acute low back pain.",E,E

Although some authors have demonstrated that the use of intramuscular bupivacaine during lumbar discectomy resulted in a marked reduction of postoperative back pain, others have reported that the key intervention was probably the administration of epidural corticosteroid. The coadministration of these two drugs in lumbar disc surgery for the relief of postoperative back pain has yet not been studied adequately.; Assessment of the combined use of perioperative corticosteroids and bupivacaine for the relief of postoperative pain after lumbar disc surgery.; Forty-four selected patients had acute-onset single-level unilateral herniated nucleus pulposus that were refractory to conservative management. All patients underwent lumbar disc surgery under standard general anesthesia. Before surgical incision, the skin and subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with 10 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline to produce local vasoconstriction. During wound closure, 20 mL 0.9% saline in Group 1 (n = 22) and 20 mL 0.25% bupivacaine in Group 2 (n = 22) were injected into the paravertebral muscles and subcutaneus tissues. In addition, a piece of autologous fat taken from the wound was first soaked in 40 mg of methylprednisolone for 10 minutes, then placed over the exposed nerve root, and the remaining steroid was flushed into the wound in Group 2. The wound was closed after drug administration in both groups. In the postoperative period, all patients received 100 mg of meperidine intramuscularly when needed and were allowed to receive a second dose at least 4 hours later than the first dose for postoperative analgesia. Postoperative back pain intensity, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure were assessed 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours after the conclusion of surgery.; Visual analog scale pain scores for the postoperative recordings were lower in Group 2 than in Group 1, but these findings were not statistically significant. Patients in Group 1 received 77.3 +/- 48.8 mg meperidine, and those in Group 2 received 31.8 +/- 45.5 mg meperidine, for pain medication in the first 12 hours (P < 0.05). Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were not significantly different between the two groups in all recording periods.; It is concluded that the perioperative use of bupivacaine and corticosteroids during lumbar discectomy maintains effective postoperative analgesia and decreases opioid usage without complications.",E,E

It has been used with lumbar microdiscectomy to facilitate management of surgical pain, shorten patient recovery time, and increase patient satisfaction with the procedure and the hospital stay. Adcon-L (Gliatech, Inc., Cleveland, OH) (adhesion control in a barrier gel) has been demonstrated to act as a barrier to the development of epidural fibrosis after lumbar procedures, minimizing the formation of fibrotic scar and improving the long-term outcome. In this study, we used Adcon-L as a vehicle to administer 1 mg of morphine epidurally to patients who underwent lumbar microdiscectomy. Our objective was to evaluate the safety and analgesic efficacy of this compound.; A randomized, controlled, double-blind study was conducted in 100 patients. Patients were randomized to two groups: the morphine-Adcon-L (M-ADL) group (n = 51 patients) or the Adcon-L control group (n = 49 patients). Outcome measures included: 1) a visual analog scale to assess the intensity of spontaneous low back and radicular pain, 2) a straight leg-raising maneuver to assess the degree of leg elevation in relation to evoked sciatic pain, 3) postoperative time to comfortable walking, 4) duration of postoperative hospitalization, 5) required amount of postoperative analgesics, and 6) postoperative work time loss.; No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed. No clinically relevant adverse events, such as urinary retention, respiratory disturbances, or wound infections were reported in the M-ADL group. At the time of hospital discharge, results were as follows: 1) the M-ADL group had significantly lower pain intensity scores (mean value of postoperative visual analog scale, 12.3 mm +/- 0.9 in the M-ADL group versus 24.7 mm +/- 11.5 in the control group[P < 0.0001]); 2) the M-ADL group consumed significantly less analgesics: 57.4% of M-ADL patients versus 95.9% of controls received analgesics in the hospital, and 23.5% of M-ADL patients versus 55.1% of controls used analgesics at home (P < 0.0001); 3) the M-ADL group had significantly shorter hospital stays (1.37 +/- 0.07 d versus 2.53 +/- 0.12 d in the control group[P < 0.0001]); 4) the M-ADL group had a significantly higher degree of symptomatic leg elevation in the straight leg raising (mean postoperative straight leg-raising test, 64.41 degrees +/- 1.59 versus 57.77 degrees +/- 1.85 in the controls[P = 0.02]); and 5) the M-ADL group lost significantly less postoperative work time (21.67 +/- 0.92 d versus 29.47 +/- 1.18 d in the control group). In addition, at 1 year of follow-up, there was no clinical evidence of late-onset neurological complications.; The epidural application of the compound M-ADL after lumbar microdiscectomy was found to be safe and effective, and it significantly improved postoperative pain control and return to function.",E,E

This study reports a randomised controlled trial designed to compare the effectiveness of diamorphine administered as PCA utilising either the intranasal or intravenous routes. We investigated 52 consecutive patients undergoing primary lower limb joint replacement surgery. Patients were randomly allocated to receive PCA diamorphine, administered either intravenously (0.5 mg bolus, 3 min lockout) or intranasally (1.0 mg bolus, 3 min lockout). Pain was assessed using a Visual Analogue Score (VAS) at rest and on movement on five occasions over the first 36 h postoperatively. The results demonstrated that patients in the intranasal PCA group had significantly higher VAS scores than the intravenous group, both at rest (intranasal median 35.5 vs. intravenous median 20; p = 0.030) and on movement (intranasal median 64 vs. intravenous median 50; p = 0.016). However, significantly fewer patients in the intranasal group compared with the intravenous group suffered episodes of vomiting (intranasal 0/24 vs. intravenous 6/24 patients; p = 0.022).

They agreed to conform to a clinical pathway (CP) of liquid diet (CP1) and full mobility (CP2) on day 1, solid diet (CP3) on day 2 and discharge (CP4) before day 5. Their compliance was monitored by an assessor blinded to the operative group, who also rated pain and mobility. Patient-controlled morphine use was documented. Neuroendocrine and immune stress response and respiratory function were measured.; Some 75 per cent of all clinical pathway objectives of early recovery were achieved in the laparoscopic group compared with 37 per cent in the open group (P < 0.01). Significant differences in favour of laparoscopy were noted with regard to narcotic requirements, and pain and mobility scores. Differences in objective measures of stress response favouring laparoscopy were found for urinary catecholamines, interleukin 6, serum cortisol and C-reactive protein. No differences were noted in respiratory function but significant respiratory morbidity was greater in the open group (P < 0.05).

There was a correlation between the effects of morphine on spontaneous pain and the decrease of the responses to suprathreshold thermal stimuli on the nonpainful contralateral side, suggesting that these effects were related to the general antinociceptive activity of the drug. The effects of IV morphine were correlated with those of oral morphine at 1 month, but only 3 patients (20%) were still taking morphine after 1 year.; IV morphine induces analgesic effects on some components of central neuropathic pain syndromes, but only a minority of patients may benefit from long-term opioid treatment.",E,E

In addition to a normal postoperative analgesic regimen, each patient received placebo or piroxicam fast-dissolving dosage form (2 tablets administered sublingually 1 to 3 hours before surgery). This regimen was repeated with 2 tablets after 24 hours, then 1 tablet after 48 hours. Postoperative pain was evaluated every 6 hours by a visual analog scale for 3 days. The amount of morphine usage was measured on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. Postoperative variables such as blood loss, length of wound, and time of operation also were recorded.; There was no difference between the groups with respect to age, weight, height, gender, and type of operation. The postoperative pain of the study group, as measured by visual analog scale, showed significant improvement (P < 0.05) during the postoperative period 12 to 42 hours after surgery. The study group used less morphine, but their usage showed no significant difference on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. When the visual analog scale between the types of operation was compared, the scale for the discectomy group was better than that for the laminectomy group. The results of the postoperative variables showed no difference between the groups in terms of postoperative blood loss, length of wound, and time of operation.; Sublingual administration of piroxicam fast-dissolving dosage form after simple spine surgery is effective and efficient in relief of postoperative pain. Because of its low side effects and high toleration, piroxicam fast-dissolving dosage form may be considered as an alternative for postoperative pain control during the early postoperative period.",E,E

Because adolescents whose pain persists may have chronic pain as adults, a subsample of 42 adolescents from a prevalence study in which continuation of their pain was observed throughout the study period was investigated quantitatively and qualitatively. All mothers (n = 42) completed a questionnaire on the impact of the adolescent's pain on the family. The authors tested the hypothesis that pain parameters, pain-related quality of life, and impact of pain on the family would deteriorate over time.; Three-year follow-up questionnaires, diaries, and interviews were used.; The study was conducted in the general population in the Rotterdam area.; Adolescents (aged 12-18 years) who indicated chronic pain in our previous prevalence study and in a diary and questionnaire each year of the 3-year follow-up were included in the study.; The most prevalent pains were limb pain and headache. The pain intensity was mild (33 mm on a visual analog scale), very frequent (72% of all diary entries), and associated with relatively poor functional status and poor psychological and somatic functioning. The pain parameters, pain-related quality of life, and impact of pain on the family (i.e., restrictions in social life and problems in dealing with the stress of the adolescent's pain) remained surprisingly stable across the assessments. The interviews showed that pain had become part of the daily life of several adolescents, who structured their activities and sleeping hours to prevent aggravation of pain. In particular, adolescents with headache reported problems with cognitive activities, whereas those with limb pain and back pain reported problems with physical activities.; For adolescents with persistent pain with no known organic cause, intensity and frequency of pain, quality of life, and impact of pain on the family did not change. Generally, they seemed to cope quite well with their pain. In view of these results, further studies should involve follow-up of adolescents with persistent pain into adulthood to establish the determinants of their pain and to find out whether they maintain their adaptive ways of living with their pain.",E,E

The present study examined the effects of the administration of metoclopramide on the postoperative opioid analgesic requirements and pain intensity scores of patients following laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation under general anesthesia. Fifty-six subjects were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective study. Subjects were randomized into 2 groups, a control placebo group (n = 30) and an experimental metoclopramide group (n = 26), and were assessed for pain intensity using a numeric rating scale. Assessments were recorded at 3 time intervals. Total postoperative opioid requirements also were recorded. Numeric rating scale pain scores were noted to be similar in both groups at all 3 time intervals examined. However, total postanesthesia care unit (PACU) morphine requirements were significantly higher in the placebo group than the metoclopramide group (P = .031). This study demonstrated that metoclopramide administered preoperatively can significantly decrease morphine requirements in the PACU but had no impact on pain intensity as rated by numeric rating scale pain scores.",E,E

However, there is evidence that, following its relatively short-lived analgesic effect, there is a more prolonged spinal opioid tolerance effect. The effectiveness of postoperative epidural fentanyl analgesia may therefore be reduced following the use of spinal fentanyl at operation. This randomised, double-blind study was designed to assess whether patient-controlled epidural fentanyl could produce effective analgesia following 25 microg of spinal fentanyl at operation. Patients undergoing elective Caesarean section received spinal bupivacaine combined with either fentanyl 25 microg (fentanyl group; n = 18) or normal saline (saline group; n = 18). Patient-controlled epidural fentanyl was used for postoperative analgesia. The fentanyl group used a mean of 23.4 (SD 14.5) microg x h(-1) of fentanyl, compared with 27.0 (10.8) microg x h(-1) for the saline group (p =0.41). Using a 0-100 mm visual analogue score for pain, the maximum pain score recorded at rest for the fentanyl group was median 24 [IQR 15-35] mm, compared with 15 [13-45] mm for the saline group (p = 0.41). The maximum pain score recorded on coughing for the fentanyl group was 29 [24-46] mm, compared with 27 [19-47] mm for the saline group (p = 0.44). Nine of the fentanyl group rated postoperative analgesia as excellent and nine as good, compared with 10 of the saline group who rated it as excellent and eight as good (p = 0.74).

Analgesic efficacy, side-effects and costs were calculated during 48 h.; VAS pain scores both at rest and during mobilization were lower in the PCA group, more particularly during the second postoperative day. Nausea and vomiting were more frequently registered in the morphine treated patients. PCA treated patients stayed longer in the recovery room but required fewer nurse interventions on the surgical ward. Manpower and drug costs were equal in both groups. The differences in total costs (Euro) amounted to euros 33 and were mainly caused by the more expensive equipment required for epidural PCA. Satisfaction and hospital discharge were similar for both treatments.; It was concluded that epidural PCA induced better pain relief, caused less nausea/vomiting but was more expensive than intrathecal morphine.",E,E

In the EP group (n=24) 0.1 mg x kg(-1) morphine in 0.2 ml x kg(-1) saline were given epidurally at the L3-4 level and in the PCA group (n=20) 0.1 mg x kg-1 morphine was given i.v. immediately after intubation. Postoperative PCA bolus doses were 0.5 mg for patients weighing less than 20 kg, 1 mg for children weighing 20-30 kg and 1.5 mg for children weighing 30-40 kg. Blood samples were withdrawn following induction and at 1, 8, 12 and 24 h after morphine administration for measurement of blood glucose, insulin, cortisol and morphine levels. Patients were observed for 24 h postoperatively; heart rate, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, FACES pain scores, sedation scores and complications were recorded.; The PCA group received 0.56 +/- 0.33 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) morphine. The FACES pain scores, sedation scores, cortisol, blood glucose and insulin levels were similar in both groups. Haemodynamic and respiratory evaluations and cortisol levels were stable but blood glucose and insulin changes at certain time periods were significant (P < 0.05).

The aim of this study was to compare the anti-emetic efficacy and safety of ondansetron, placebo and metoclopramide in the treatment of opioid-induced nausea and emesis (OIE) in cancer patients. This was a multinational, multicentre, double-blind, parallel group study in which cancer patients who were receiving a full opioid agonist for cancer pain were randomised to receive one of oral ondansetron 24 mg once daily, metoclopramide 10 mg three times daily, or placebo. Study medication was started only if the patient experienced nausea and/or emesis following opioid administration. Efficacy and safety assessments were made over a study period of 24 h from the time of the first dose of anti-emetics/placebo. The study was terminated prematurely because of the difficulties in recruiting patients satisfying the stringent entry criteria. Ninety-two patients were included in the intent-to-treat population: 30 patients received placebo, 29 patients ondansetron and 33 patients metoclopramide. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the proportion achieving complete control of emesis (33% of patients on placebo, 48% on ondansetron and 52% on metoclopramide) or complete control of nausea (23% of patients on placebo, 17% on ondansetron and 36% on metoclopramide). Rescue anti-emetics were required in 8 of 33 patients on metoclopramide, 4 of 29 on ondansetron, and 3 of 30 on placebo.

Sixty-four patients were allocated prospectively and randomly into three groups: paracetamol (the P group, n = 8), paracetamol and tramadol (the PT group, n = 29), and paracetamol and nalbuphine (the PN group, n = 27). General anesthesia was standardized with propofol and remifentanil using atracurium as the muscle relaxant. One hour before the end of surgery, all patients received 30 mg/kg propacetamol intravenously then 30 mg/kg every 6 hours. Patients in the PT group received 1.5 mg/kg tramadol 1 hour before the end of surgery. For patients in the PN group, 0.15 mg/kg nalbuphine was injected after discontinuation of remifentanil, because of its mu-antagonist effect. Postoperative pain was assessed in the fully awake patient after extubation (hour 0) and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours using a visual analog scale (VAS). Additional tramadol (1.5 mg/kg) or 0.15 mg/kg nalbuphine was administered when the VAS score was > or = 30 mm. Analgesia was compared using the Mantha and Kaplan-Meier methods. Adverse effects of the drugs were also measured. The three groups were similar with respect to the total dose of remifentanil received (0.27 +/- 0.1 mircog/kg/min). In all patients, extubation was obtained within 6 +/- 3 minutes after remifentanil administration. Postoperative analgesia was ineffective in the P group; therefore, inclusions in this group were stopped after the eighth patient. Postoperative analgesia was effective in the two remaining groups because VAS scores were similar, except at hour 1, when nalbuphine was more effective (P = .001). Nevertheless, acquiring such a result demanded significantly more tramadol than nalbuphine (P < .05). More cases of nausea and vomiting were observed in the PT group but the difference was not significant (P < .06). In conclusion, pain after supratentorial neurosurgery must be taken into account, and paracetamol alone is insufficient in bringing relief to the patient. Addition of either tramadol or nalbuphine to paracetamol seems necessary to achieve adequate analgesia, with, nevertheless, a larger dose of tramadol to fulfill this objective.",E,E

In a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled fashion, the patients received either i.v. diclofenac 75 mg (n = 24), ketoprofen 100 mg (n = 24) or saline (n = 16) in the recovery room, followed by oral diclofenac 150 mg/day, ketoprofen 300 mg/day or placebo, respectively, for 3 days, supplemented by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with i.v. oxycodone.; The mean consumption of oxycodone during the first, second and third study days was 45.3, 22.3 and 15.2 mg in the diclofenac group, 43.5, 37.5 and 21.8 mg in the ketoprofen group, and 61.2, 45.9 and 36.1 mg, respectively, in the placebo group. Oxycodone consumption was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the ketoprofen group than in the placebo group in the postoperative period 13-24 h and 61-72 h. Diclofenac was superior to placebo in the postoperative period 25-48 h (P < 0.01), 49-60 h (P < 0.05) and to ketoprofen at 49-60 h (P < 0.05). During administration of diclofenac on days 1-3 and ketoprofen on day 2, the mean pain scores (VAS) were lower than in the placebo group (P < 0.05). Six patients had difficulties in operating the PCA device. There were no differences in blood loss.; We conclude that in the first day after knee arthroplasty (13-24 h), ketoprofen exerted an opioid-sparing effect. After day 1 (25-60 h), with the doses used, diclofenac proved to be better than placebo, whereas ketoprofen was not.",E,E

All patients were regularly taking oral amitriptyline 50 mg at bedtime. Pain was evaluated using a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS). The morphine regimen was individually adjusted to a maximal oral dose of 80 to 90 mg/day, to maintain the VAS score less than 4/10 cm. When patients complained of pain (VAS equal or greater than 4/10), despite taking 80 to 90 mg of oral morphine daily, the transdermal test drug was supplemented as follows: the control group received a placebo patch daily, and the nitroglycerine group received a 5-mg/24-hour nitroglycerine patch daily. Patients were free to manipulate their daily morphine consumption at the time the test drug was administered, to keep VAS less than 4/10 cm. After the introduction of the transdermal test drug, patients were evaluated by the staff on a weekly basis as outpatients, over four consecutive weeks.; The groups were similar in respect to demographic data and VAS pain scores before the treatment. The daily consumption of oral morphine was smaller in the nitroglycerine group compared with the control group after the 14th day of evaluation (p < 0.002). Patients from the control group in general complained of somnolence, compared with the nitroglycerine group.; Transdermal nitroglycerine was an effective coadjuvant analgesic. In conjunction with its opioid tolerance sparing function, delivery of nitric oxide donors together with opioids may be of significant benefit in cancer pain management in delaying morphine tolerance and decreasing the incidence of adverse effects related to high doses of opioids.",E,E

Diclofenac, a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, is widely used to treat acute and chronic pain but there are few reports of its use given rectally in children undergoing strabismus surgery. This open randomised study was designed to investigate the analgesic and anti-emetic properties of rectally administered diclofenac compared with opioid (morphine) given i.v. in connection with strabismus surgery in children.; After obtaining approval from the local ethics committee and written informed consent from the parents, 50 ASA class I-II children, 4-16 years of age, were randomised to receive either rectally administered diclofenac (Voltaren) 1 mg/kg or i.v. opioid (morphine) 0.05 mg/kg perioperatively. The children were consecutively operated upon from May 1999 to January 2001. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl and propofol and maintained with propofol. Nitrous oxide was omitted. The postoperative pain was assessed after arrival at the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) by using the validated Wong and Baker scale (FACES) Pain Rating Scale. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was assessed by measuring the frequency of vomiting and the degree of nausea.; In the diclofenac group the incidence of PONV during the first 24 h was 12% (of which one child had severe vomiting). The incidence of PONV was much higher, 72% (P = 0.0000), in the morphine group, where 56% of the children also had severe vomiting. There were no difference in pain score between the two groups. Recovery time at the PACU was longer (P < 0.002) and the postoperative analgesic requirement higher in the morphine group (10 vs. 5 children). No children needed overnight admission to the hospital.; Diclofenac given rectally is an effective analgesic for this kind of surgery and gives less postoperative nausea than i.v. morphine.

It is also increasingly considered to be an alternative to methadone in the maintenance and eventual detoxification of heroin addicts, and also in the treatment of cocaine addiction. So far, buprenorphine has been available as a sublingual tablet and as a solution for IV injection. Recently, a new transdermal formulation of buprenorphine in slow-release matrix patches has been introduced (Transtec) for the treatment of intermediate to severe pain.; The aim of this paper is to review, from a preclinical perspective, the current status of what is known about the behavioral pharmacology of buprenorphine, with a particular emphasis on the issues of reward, addiction, and dependence. It will also point to open questions that should be addressed in the future to improve our understanding of the effects and the mechanisms of action of this drug.; Since buprenorphine is a potent opioid drug, the issue of addiction and dependence in this context is an important one. Although there are still some gaps in the behavioral pharmacological characterization of buprenorphine, the general conclusion that can be drawn from the reviewed literature is that despite the high affinity of buprenorphine for the mu receptor it appears to be a remarkably safe drug, with a benign overall side effect profile and low addictive and dependence-inducing potential. This favorable side effect profile appears to be due, to a large extent, to the partial agonistic properties of the drug, in combination with its particular receptor kinetics (i.e. very slow dissociation from the mu receptor after binding).",E,E

Previously, the authors established the ED50 for 60 min of labor analgesia from intrathecal sufentanil using an up-down sequential allocation study design. The current study first establishes an ED50 for intrathecal fentanyl using this same study design to establish an intrathecal potency ratio for fentanyl and sufentanil and then uses this ratio to compare the efficacy, duration of analgesia, and side effects from comparable doses of intrathecal fentanyl and sufentanil.; Seventy-five healthy nulliparous women requesting labor analgesia were enrolled in this two-part study. In phase I, 20 women received varying doses of fentanyl to establish an ED50 for 60 min of labor analgesia. In phase II, 55 women were randomized to receive either 36 microg intrathecal fentanyl or 8 microg sufentanil (2 times the ED50s) via a combined spinal-epidural technique and by double-blinded design. Pain relief, side effects, block height, maternal hemodynamics, and fetal heart rate were assessed throughout the study. The duration of spinal analgesia was considered to be the time from injection of study drug to the time of the patient's first request for additional analgesia.; The ED50 of intrathecal fentanyl for 60 min of labor analgesia was found to be 18.2 microg, and therefore, the potency ratio of intrathecal sufentanil to intrathecal fentanyl at the ED50 level is 4.4:1. The duration of spinal analgesia was significantly longer from 8 microg intrathecal sufentanil than from 36 microg intrathecal fentanyl (104 +/- 34 vs. 79 +/- 34 min, P = 0.009). Otherwise, patient demographics, maternal hemodynamics, duration of labor, mode of delivery, motor block, subjective leg weakness, pruritus, nausea, pinprick sensory levels, visual analog scale pain scores, fetal bradycardia, and Apgar scores were similar between groups.; The relative potency of intrathecal sufentanil to fentanyl for labor analgesia is 4.4:1. When using intrathecal opioids alone for early labor analgesia, 8 microg sufentanil produces labor analgesia lasting approximately 25 min longer than from 36 microg fentanyl, without a statistically significant increase in side effects. However, when making a choice between fentanyl and sufentanil, one must consider other important factors, such as the higher cost of sufentanil and the greater risk of dosing error due to the higher potency of sufentanil compared with fentanyl.",E,E

In a randomized clinical trial that tested the effectiveness of the PRO-SELF Pain Control Program, 11 patients declined to increase their analgesic use despite moderate to severe pain. These patients were selected for a qualitative analysis of their audiotaped discussions about pain management with their intervention nurses. This analysis revealed that these patients often spontaneously provided detailed explanations about why they were reluctant or unwilling to take analgesics in general or opioids in particular. We termed these explanatory accounts pain management autobiographies because of their narrative character and multilayered, richly detailed quality. Pain management autobiographies included stories about (1) previous experience with chronic pain management, including stigmatizing interactions with clinicians and family members; (2) bad experiences with cancer pain management, including severe constipation; and 3) strongly held conventions about medication use, including the belief that all medications are ""toxins"" that should be avoided.

The product was previously being developed in collaboration with Janssen, but by February 2000, Janssen was no longer involved in its development. In January 1998, Janssen, ALZA and Crescendo had plans to develop the product for the potential treatment of chronic pain in addition to the acute pain indication; however, no further development for this indication has been reported since that date. ETS is able to deliver drugs that normally would not diffuse across the skin. A small electric current passes through the patient's skin, between the two electrodes on the patch. Charged drug molecules are attracted to the electrode of the opposite polarity to their own. Manipulating the charge on drug molecules is relatively easy in most instances, so the technology should be applicable to the majority of drugs that do not lend themselves to passive diffusion. ETS technology is also potentially useful in delivering rapid boluses of drug on demand. In February 2000, Merrill Lynch predicted E-TRANS fentanyl sales at US $30 million in 2002, rising to US $131 million in 2004.

Most patients suffered from cancer pain and only 11 patients had chronic pain from non-malignant disease. Physicians were asked to complete a questionnaire for patients treated with transdermal fentanyl on initiation of therapy (day 0), and days 3, 6, 18, 30 thereafter, followed by monthly follow-up intervals. Patients were asked to complete a pain diary. Transdermal therapy was documented from day 0 for 824 patients, while 181 patients had been treated with transdermal fentanyl before admission in the survey. Most of the other 824 patients had been treated with other step 3 opioids (55% of the patients) or step 2 opioids (23%) before conversion to transdermal fentanyl, whereas 8% had been treated only with non-opioids and 14% had received analgesics only as required or not at all before initiation of transdermal therapy. The most important reasons for switching to transdermal opioid therapy were insufficient pain relief with the previous medication followed by a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms impeding oral analgesic therapy. Initial fentanyl doses ranged from 0.6 to 9.6 mg/day (25 to 400 microg/h) with a median of 1.2 mg/day (50 microg/h). Median doses slowly increased throughout the observation period to 2.4 mg/day (100 microg/h) after 4 months of treatment. Most patients continued transdermal therapy until the time of death (47% of patients). Other reasons for discontinuation were inadequate pain relief (10%), pain relief with other analgesic regimens (10%), other symptoms than pain (5%), rejection of transdermal therapy by the patient (6%) or miscellaneous (16%). Adverse events were documented as the reason for discontinuation of transdermal therapy in 49 patients (5%). Dyspnoea was documented for seven patients as the reason for discontinuation. One of these patients, as well as another patient with an episode of apnoea, had to be treated with artificial respiration for several hours, but both patients recovered without sequelae. Transdermal therapy with fentanyl was safe and efficient in this national survey. Transdermal fentanyl can be recommended for treatment of moderate to severe cancer pain and probably may even be used as a first-line drug on step 3 of the World Health Organization recommendations in selected patient groups.",E,E

The aim of this study was to verify the effects of NSAIDs on morphine escalation in advanced cancer patients with pain followed-up at home and to assess the pharmacoeconomic implications. A prospective randomised controlled study was carried out in 156 consecutive advanced cancer patients with pain followed-up at home in the period December 1999-December 2000. In this group of patients, 47 were selected with pain progression after 1 week of opioid stabilisation. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: group 'O' patients were treated with continuing opioid escalation according to their clinical needs; group 'OK' received ketorolac 60 mg/daily orally (p.o.) in three doses and then continued opioid escalation according to their clinical situation. Performance status, doses of morphine before and after starting treatment, mean weekly pain intensity (assessed by means of a numerical scale from 0 to 10), mean weekly symptoms intensity, adverse effects and pain mechanisms were recorded. Moreover, drug costs per day in both groups were calculated. Patients who received ketorolac in addition to morphine showed a better analgesia after a week in comparison to the group treated with morphine only (P=0.005). Thereafter, morphine escalation was slower and the maximum morphine dose was lower in the group treated with ketorolac. The incidence and the severity of gastric discomfort was more evident in patients treated with ketorolac, while constipation was significantly increased in patients who received morphine only. Drug costs per day were similar in both groups; statistical differences were observed in patients who started on lower morphine doses (<100 mg/daily) in the two groups (4.3 in the ketorolac-morphine group versus 3.4 in the morphine group; P=0.012). The use of NSAIDs reduces the need for an opioid dose escalation or allows the use of lower doses. Their use is associated with a more intense gastric discomfort, but results in less opioid-related constipation. The eventual additive cost for NSAIDs therapy is negligible, especially in patients taking high doses of morphine.",E,E

Key features may be self-administration, combined with rapid onset of action. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the present base of knowledge on this topic.; The review is based on human studies found in Medline or in the reference list of these papers. The physiology of the nasal mucosa and some pharmaceutical aspects of nasal administration are described. The design of each study is described, but not systematically evaluated.; Pharmacokinetic studies in volunteers are reported for fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil, butorphanol, oxycodone and buprenorphine. Mean times for achieving maximum serum concentrations vary from 5 to 50 min, while mean figures for bioavailability vary from 46 to 71%. Fentanyl, pethidine and butorphanol have been studied for postoperative pain. Mean onset times vary from 12 to 22 min and times to peak effect from 24 to 60 min. There is considerable interindividual variation in pharmacokinetics and clinical outcome. This may partly be due to lack of optimization of nasal formulations. Patient-controlled nasal analgesia is an effective alternative to intravenous PCA. Adverse effects are mainly those related to the opioids themselves, rather than to nasal administration. Some experience with nasal opioids in outpatients and for chronic pain has also been reported.; Nasal administration of opioids has promising features, but is still in its infancy. Adequately designed clinical studies are needed. Improvements of nasal sprayer devices and opioid formulations may improve clinical outcome.",E,E

Intravenous morphine, 4 mg, was studied as a positive analgesic control.; In this multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, women experiencing moderate-to-severe pain on the first day after abdominal hysterectomy or myomectomy received one intravenous dose of parecoxib sodium, 20 or 40 mg, ketorolac, 30 mg, morphine, 4 mg, or placebo. Analgesic efficacy and tolerability were evaluated for 24 h postdose or until patients, whose pain was not adequately controlled, opted to receive rescue analgesia.; Two hundred two patients were enrolled. All treatment groups had comparable demographics and baseline pain status. All active treatments had an equally rapid time to onset of analgesia (10-23 min). Overall, each parecoxib sodium dose and ketorolac were significantly superior to morphine and placebo for most measures of analgesic efficacy at most time points, including a significantly longer (two- to threefold) time to rescue analgesia (P </= 0.05). All treatments were well tolerated.; Single intravenous doses of parecoxib sodium, 20 mg and 40 mg, have comparable analgesic effects and are well tolerated after laparotomy surgery.

The aim of this nationwide survey was to evaluate the prevalence of acute and postoperative pain in children; extent of, and reasons for, inadequate pain therapy; therapy methods; pain-management structure; and the need for education of healthcare professionals. Questionnaires concerning these points were sent to all departments in Sweden involved in the treatment of children. The response rate was 75% (299/ 395). Answers from physicians and nurses showed that, despite treatment, moderate to severe pain occurred in 23% of patients with postoperative pain and 31% of patients with pain of other origin. Postoperative pain seemed to be a greater problem in units where children were treated along with adults and in departments where fewer children were treated. According to 45% of physicians and nurses, treatment of pain could often or always be managed more efficiently. Pain assessments were performed regularly in 43% of all departments, but pain measurement was less frequent; 3% of the departments had no formal organization for pain management; and 15% never or infrequently used potent opioids. Educational needs were high. Insufficient pain treatment seemed to be mostly related to organizational aspects, such as inadequate prescriptions. Anxiety in children or parents also contributed to ineffective pain treatment. Swedish treatment practices for the management of pain in children roughly follow the published guidelines, but many improvements are still necessary.; Acute pain in children is still undertreated in Swedish hospitals. This seems to be related mainly to organizational aspects.",E,E

This study tested whether anger variables are associated with impaired endogenous opioid antinociceptive activity, and whether these relationships differed between chronic pain patients and healthy normals. Forty-three chronic low back pain (LBP) sufferers and 45 pain-free normals received opioid blockade (8 mg naloxone i.v.) or placebo blockade (saline) in randomized, counterbalanced order in separate sessions. During each session, subjects participated in a 1-min finger pressure pain task followed by an ischemic forearm pain task (maximum duration 5 min), providing pain intensity ratings during and immediately following each task. As a measure of opioid antinociceptive function, drug effects were derived by subtracting placebo from blockade condition pain ratings. Multivariate general linear model analyses indicated that anger-out, but not anger-in, had significant main effects on both finger pressure drug effects (P < 0.05) and ischemic task drug effects (P < 0.05). As hypothesized, high anger-out scores were associated with an absence of opioid analgesia during the acute pain tasks; low anger-out scores were associated with effective opioid analgesia. A similar non-significant trend was noted for trait anger on finger pressure drug effects (P < 0.06). Anger-out x LBP/normal interactions were non-significant, suggesting that links between anger-out and drug effects were similar for patients and normals. Controlling for depression did not eliminate the significant relationship between anger-out and drug effects. Findings suggest that anger-in and anger-out affect pain sensitivity through different mechanisms: only the effects of anger-out may be mediated by endogenous opioid dysfunction.",E,E

Valdecoxib 1.25 to 10mg twice daily and valdecoxib 10mg once daily were more effective than placebo for the relief of pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, and dosages above 5mg twice daily were similar in efficacy to naproxen 500mg twice daily. Similarly, valdecoxib 5 and 10 mg/day were as effective for osteoarthritis of the hip as naproxen 500mg twice daily. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, valdecoxib 10, 20 or 40 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo, and similar in efficacy to naproxen 500mg twice daily; there were no significant differences in efficacy between the three dosages of valdecoxib. Valdecoxib 20 or 40mg administered 1 to 3 hours before and 12, 24 and 36 hours after hip arthroplasty provided significantly better analgesia than placebo, and significantly reduced the amount of morphine taken by patients.

The initial pharmacological approach to treating the disorder is the management of the pain. Tricyclic antidepressants are the most effective drugs in use so far, especially when administered in combination with other therapies (e.g., selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors), which suggests modulation of the neurotransmitters serotonin and noradrenaline. The effectiveness of amitriptyline and related tricyclic antidepressants, however, is consistent with the involvement of mechanisms, such as potassium channel modulation and NMDA receptor antagonism, in addition to or in place of the modulation of monoamine neurotransmitters. Investigation of the importance of each of the pharmacological properties of amitriptyline and related molecules in the management of fibromyalgia could provide clues for the rational design of new drugs.",E,E

It is not treated until it results in the loss of routine ability and function. Chronic pain is often associated with underlying diseases commonly seen in childhood, including sickle cell disease, malignancy, rheumatologic disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, trauma, and states where there is no identifiable etiology. Chronic pain differs from acute pain in that it serves no useful function. Untreated or under-treated chronic pain will result in the unnecessary suffering of the patient, disruption of family routine, and cohesiveness and restriction of the child's daily activities, thereby increasing long-term disability. Accurate and repeated assessment of chronic pain is required for therapy to be effective. Assessment of chronic pain in children is difficult due to their developing cognitive abilities. The assessment of childhood pain varies with the child's age, type of pain, situation, and prior painful experiences. Assessment tools such as the Varni-Thompson Pediatric Pain Questionnaire and the Visual Analog Scale are helpful for both the patient and physician in helping to identify situations that precipitate pain, to rate the level of pain and determine if therapy has been effective. Documentation of pain assessments and the effectiveness of interventions in the medical record should be included as a routine part of all patient records. Most caregivers have extensive experience in the treatment of acute pain in children but are often not comfortable with the management of complicated and chronic pain states. The therapy for chronic pain in children is multifactorial. It can include agents from multiple classes of pharmacologic agents (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and antineuroleptics) nonconventional therapies (acupuncture and pressure and aromatherapy), as well as herbal and homeopathic remedies.",E,E

In this study, the authors tabulated actual costs, in Canadian dollars, in a consecutive series of patients undergoing IDT within the Canadian health care system and have compared them with costs in a control group in the same environment. The influence of these treatments on the quality of life (QOL) was also analyzed.; The authors report on a series of 67 patients suffering from failed back syndrome, 23 of whom underwent implantation of a programmable drug delivery pump and 44 of whom acted as controls. Patients were followed for a 5-year period during which the investigators tabulated the actual costs incurred for diagnostic imaging, professional fees, implantation costs including hardware, nursing visits for maintenance of the pumps, alternative therapies, and hospitalization costs for breakthrough pain. From this data, cumulative costs for each group were calculated for a 5-year period. Patient responses on the Oswestry Pain Questionnaire were analyzed to assess the impact of treatment on QOL. The actual cumulative costs for IDT during a 5-year period were $29,410, as opposed to $38,000 for CPT. High initial costs of equipment required for IDT were recovered by 28 months. After this time point, managing patients with CPT became the more expensive treatment option for the remainder of the follow-up period. The Oswestry Disability Index showed a 27% improvement for patients in the IDT group, compared with a 12% improvement in the control group.; In patients who respond to this treatment, IDT is cost effective in the long term despite high initial costs of implantable devices.",E,E

Oxycodone, frequently prescribed for the relief of moderate to severe pain, is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6, encoded by a polymorphic gene with three mutations (*3, *4, and *5) with a combined 95% allelic frequency and about 10% prevalence. Individuals with variant alleles are more susceptible to oxycodone toxicity. By assessing the prevalence of CYP2D6 polymorphisms and covariables, we hypothesized that oxycodone fatality may be partially due to poor drug metabolism caused by CYP2D6 variant alleles. From the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office (MCMEO), a retrospective analysis of 15 oxycodone cases was followed by genotyping blood samples for the variant alleles by conventional and real-time PCRs. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. Oxycodone, extracted from blood and/or urine, was quantitated by GC-MS. The results show two homozygous for 2D6*4 and four heterozygous for 2D6*4. The MCMEO was not significantly different from those in the control group (n = 26) (p > 0.05, Fisher's Exact Test). However, genotyping CYP2D6 provided a more definitive interpretation of the oxycodone toxicity in four cases. Therefore, pharmacogenomics may serve as an adjunct in the determination of the cause and manner of death in forensic toxicology and a pharmacogenomic algorithm for genotyping has been proposed.",E,E

However, further study is needed to examine which outcome variables change, when, for whom, and how.; Published literature was gathered from Medline, PsychLit, and searches of relevant journals.; Overall, BT-CBT for chronic pain reduces patients' pain, distress, and pain behavior, and improves their daily functioning. Differences across studies in sample characteristics, treatment features, and assessment methods seem to produce varied treatment results. Also, some patients benefit more than others. Highly distressed patients who see their pain as an uncontrollable and highly negative life event derive less benefit than other patients. Decreased negative emotional responses to pain, decreased perceptions of disability, and increased orientation toward self-management during the course of treatment predict favorable treatment outcome.; Current BT-CBT helps many patients with chronic pain.

Early systems were plagued with a high rate of complications and technical problems. With the evolving technology, especially the advent of multichannel programmable systems and more precise epidural placement, the ability of spinal cord stimulation to treat various pain syndromes improved. This article reviews the literature on spinal cord stimulation from 1967 to the present.; The literature is reviewed, with a particular focus on recent studies investigating the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation for low back pain.; Most studies are limited by the same flaws, namely, retrospective study design. At this writing, the few published randomized prospective studies have suggested that spinal cord stimulation may be superior to repeat surgery. Complication rates have declined to approximately 8%, and reoperation is necessary in approximately 4% of patients. When current percutaneous techniques are used, a lead migration rate lower than 3% may be achieved. For certain topographies, laminotomy leads may be superior, particularly with regard to low back pain.; The ultimate efficacy of spinal cord stimulation remains to be determined, primarily because of limitations associated with the published literature. However, on the basis of the current evidence, it may represent a valuable treatment option, particularly for patients with chronic pain of predominantly neuropathic origin and topographical distribution involving the extremities.

Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that DHE is a selective mu-opioid receptor (OP(3)) agonist that also binds and activates all human recombinant mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors (OP(3), OP(1), and OP(2)). The onset of the analgesic effect of DHE in rodents is rapid, 5 to 15 min after parenteral administration; the duration of action is short, the analgesic effect disappears within 120 min after administration. By oral administration much higher doses of DHE are required to produce analgesic effects. These characteristics are accounted for by the pharmacokinetic properties of DHE in the rat, namely, by rapid distribution of DHE from the injection site to the brain and rapid metabolism by glucuronidation in the gut and liver followed by elimination into the bile. Continuous infusion and repeated administration of DHE lead to the development of tolerance to analgesia, physical dependence, and a rewarding effect in normal rats but not in animals with formalin-induced inflammation. Although formalin-induced inflammation is only one type of pain stimulus, these findings suggest that DHE addiction would be observed only in the case of pain-free conditions. Clinical reports in China show that sublingual doses of DHE, 20 to 180 microg, produce a potent analgesic effect with only mild side effects, including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and shortness of breath. To improve the short-lasting effect following sublingual administration, transdermal delivery of DHE via a patch has been investigated. The patch formulation of DHE produces continuous analgesic effect with minimal physical dependence and rewarding effect in rats suffering from chronic pain. This patch formulation, which is very suitable for DHE, may be viable for the treatment of severe pain and is likely to improve patients' quality of life.",E,E

Indeed, chronic pain is often inadequately controlled in patients with cancer and in those with non-cancer chronic pain. Because of the complex nature of chronic pain, successful long-term treatment is more difficult than for acute pain. Most often acute pain is nociceptive, whereas chronic pain can be nociceptive (i.e., in response to noxious stimuli), neuropathic (i.e., initiated by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system) or mixed in origin. Opioids are the current standard of care for the treatment of moderate or severe nociceptive pain. Opioids mediate their actions by binding and activating receptors both in the peripheral nervous system and those that are found in inhibitory pain circuits that descend from the midbrain to the spinal cord dorsal horn. Opioid agonists exert a number of physiological responses including analgesia, which increases with increasing doses. The use of opioids to manage pain in patients with cancer is well accepted. The WHO step-wise algorithm for analgesic therapy based on pain severity reserves the use of opioid therapy for moderate and severe pain. The WHO algorithm has proven to be highly effective for the management of cancer pain. However, the use of opioids to treat patients with chronic non-cancer pain is controversial because of concerns about efficacy and safety, and the possibility of addiction or abuse. The results of clinical surveys and retrospective case series involving patients with non-cancer chronic pain have been inconsistent in regard to resolving these controversial issues. The oral route of drug administration is most appropriate for patients receiving opioids; although rectal, transdermal and parenteral routes of administration are used in specific situations. For continuous chronic pain, opioids should be administered around-the-clock and several long-acting formulations are available that require administration only once or twice daily. Opioid doses should be titrated according to agent-specific schedules to maximise pain relief and maintain tolerability. Adverse effects include constipation, nausea and vomiting, sedation, cognitive impairment and respiratory depression. Tolerance to the analgesic and adverse effects as well as physical dependence, which causes withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuance, may occur with opioid use. Estimates of addiction rates among patients with chronic non-cancer pain range from 3.2 to 18.9%. Successful pain treatment and symptom management is an attainable goal for the majority of patients with chronic pain. Further controlled clinical trials are needed to define the role of opioid therapy in chronic non-cancer pain, and to establish criteria for patient selection and specific treatment algorithms.",8,E

We also compared hemodynamic stability, motor blockade, ease of performing the technique, and complications.; Thirty patients who underwent partial hip replacement surgery were included in this prospective single-blind study. Subjects were randomly assigned to Group E (n=15; general anesthesia plus epidural block with 15 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine) or Group P (n=15; general anesthesia plus psoas compartment block with 30 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine). Hemodynamic parameters were recorded at 10-min intervals intraoperatively. Regional anesthesia procedure time, number of attempts at block, intraoperative blood loss, and need for supplemental fentanyl and/or ephedrine were noted. Postoperatively, a patient-controlled analgesia device delivered an infusion and boluses of bupivacaine/fentanyl. Pain, motor blockade, ambulation time, patient satisfaction with analgesia, and complications were recorded postsurgery.; The epidural required significantly more attempts than the psoas block, thus procedure time was longer in this group. Group E also showed significantly greater drops in mean arterial blood pressure from baseline at 30, 40 and 50 min after the start of general anesthesia. Significantly more Group E patients required epinephrine supplementation. The groups were similar regarding pain scores (at rest and on movement) and patient satisfaction, but Group E had higher motor blockade scores, longer ambulation time, and significantly more complications.; The continuous psoas compartment block provides excellent intraoperative and postoperative analgesia with a low incidence of complications for partial hip replacement surgery",3,E

Perioperative epidural analgesia may reduce the incidence of adverse cardiac events.; The effect of early administration of epidural analgesia during the stressful period, on cardiac events was evaluated in a prospective randomized study in 68 patients with hip fractures who either had known coronary artery disease or were at high risk for coronary artery disease. On admission to the emergency room, patients were assigned to receive a usual care analgesic regimen (intramuscular meperidine, control group, n = 34) or continuous epidural infusion of local anesthetic and opioid (epidural group, n = 34). Monitoring in the preoperative period included a preoperative history and physical examination, daily assessment of cardiac adverse events, serial electrocardiograms, cardiac enzymes, and pain scores.; Preoperative adverse cardiac events were significantly more prevalent in the control group compared with the epidural group (7 of 34 0 of 34; = 0.01). Adverse cardiac events included fatal myocardial infarction in three, fatal congestive heart failure in one, nonfatal congestive heart failure in one, and new onset atrial fibrillation in two. The incidence of intraoperative and postoperative adverse cardiac events was similar for the two groups. The significant difference between groups in the incidence of preoperative cardiac events prompted interruption of the study after the planned interim analysis.; The authors' data indicate that compared with conventional analgesia, early administration of continuous epidural analgesia is associated with a lower incidence of preoperative adverse cardiac events in elderly patients with hip fracture who have or are at risk for coronary artery disease.

To test the relevance of these observations to humans, we infused, in a randomized, double blind manner, a peripherally selective KOR agonist (ADL 10-0101) or placebo into six patients with chronic pancreatitis and ongoing abdominal pain despite mu-opioid agonist therapy. Pain was assessed using a pain magnitude estimate, an open ended scale of each patient's choosing and compared to their rating of pain from a 1.6 cm(2) thermode applied to the skin and heated to 49 degrees C for 5s. Normalizing pain scores to this rating as 100, pain prior to study drug treatment was 4070, and was unaffected by placebo infusion in the two individuals receiving this therapy. In contrast, ADL 10-0101 infusion reduced pain score from 63+/-7.6 (mean+/-SE) prior to infusion to 23+/-15 4h after infusion (P<0.05 vs. baseline). One patient receiving placebo and one receiving ADL 10-0101 experienced a mild headache during the study. One patient receiving ADL 10-0101 experienced restlessness and another had assymptomatic transient dysrhythmia upon standing after the 4h study. Neither of the treatments affected blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, or oxyhemoglobin saturation, and no patient experienced nausea during the study. These limited data support the hypothesis that human visceral afferents express KOR and that peripherally restricted KOR agonists produce analgesia in patients with chronic visceral pain.",3,E

Adenosine is an ubiquitous endogenous substance; when exogenously administered, it provides a number of salutary effects including neuromodulation, antinociception, and cytoprotective actions. The aim of this study was to characterize the perioperative antinociceptive-analgesic effects of intraoperative adenosine infusion and determine the duration of actions in the postoperative period, and compare them to those of remifentanil in patients undergoing major surgical procedures in a double-blind study.Sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to one of the two treatments. After standard induction of anesthesia, the lungs were mechanically ventilated. Anesthesia was maintained with a constant alveolar concentration of inhaled anesthetics (3% desflurane and 65% nitrous oxide in oxygen). A variable-rate of intravenous infusion of adenosine (50-500 microg kg(-1) x min(-1)) or remifentanil (0.05-0.5 microg kg(-1) x min(-1)) was initiated 5 min before the skin incision and was titrated to maintain systolic blood pressure and heart rate within 20% of baseline values during surgery. Postoperative evaluations included the level of sedation, degree of pain severity, opioid analgesic (fentanyl, morphine) consumption, and cardiorespiratory variables for 48 h. Intraoperative inhibition of the cardiovascular responses to surgical stimulation could be equally achieved by adenosine or remifentanil, and both could maintain excellent hemodynamic stability. Postoperatively, however, there were striking differences: (1). initial pain score was reduced by 60% (P<0.001) in the adenosine group compared to the remifentanil group and it remained lower throughout the 48 h recovery period; (2). postoperative morphine requirements during the first 0.25, 2 and 48 h were consistently lower in the adenosine group as compared to the remifentanil group (78, 71 and 42%, P<0.001, respectively); (3). adenosine patients remained significantly less sedated at all evaluations; (4) the end-tidal and arterial carbon dioxide values in the remifentanil group were significantly higher when patients were admitted to the postanesthesia care unit. No adverse effect of adenosine was observed at any time. Intraoperative adenosine infusion provided a salutary recovery from anesthesia associated with a pronounced and sustained postoperative pain relief. Compared to remifentanil, adenosine significantly reduced the opioid requirements and minimized the side effects including protracted sedation, cardiorespiratory instability, nausea, and vomiting in the postoperative recovery period.",3,E

This recommendation is not based on evidence from controlled studies, and many physicians start morphine treatment with controlled-release morphine. We included 40 patients with malignant disease and pain despite treatment with opioids for mild to moderate pain in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study comparing titration with immediate-release morphine given 4-hourly with titration with sustained-release morphine given once daily. The primary end point was the time needed to achieve adequate pain relief Secondary end points were other symptoms (nausea, tiredness, lack of sleep, vertigo, appetite and constipation), health related quality of life and patient satisfaction. The mean times needed for titration were 2.1 (95% CI; 1.4-2.7) days using immediate-release morphine and 1.7 (95% CI; 1.1-2.3) days using sustained-release morphine. Patients titrated with immediate-release reported statistically significant more tiredness at the end of titration. We observed no other differences in adverse effects or health related quality of life functions between the two treatments. Similar global satisfactions with the morphine treatments were reported. In conclusion, a simplified titration using sustained-release morphine once daily is equally effective as immediate-release morphine given 4-hourly.",E,E

Azathioprine (AZA) therapy was used in 40 patients (36%) as a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug.; Seven out of 111 RA patients (6.3%) were carriers of a mutant allele, TPMT3A (G(460)-->A, A(719)-->G) being the mutant allele observed most frequently. In the group of 40 AZA-treated patients, therapy was discontinued in six patients because of side-effects and in 26 patients because of lack of efficacy. Three patients presented moderate side-effects and were homozygous for the wild-type TPMT allele, whereas the remaining three patients, who developed gastrointestinal effects with severe nausea and vomiting, were TPMT3A carriers.; In this observational study, the absence of response, probably due to the low-dose scheme used, was the major cause of AZA withdrawal in our series of RA patients. TPMT genotyping may allow the use of high doses of AZA in patients with normal TPMT alleles to improve the efficacy of this immunosuppressive drug. Our data support the relationship between gastrointestinal intolerance and thiopurine metabolic imbalance.",3,E

The question, however, of whether NSAIDs produce a similar extent of potentiation among different types of pain, has not been thoroughly investigated.; A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was performed to characterize the analgesic effect of tenoxicam, a long-acting NSAID, on resting wound pain, evoked wound pain, and uterine cramping pain after cesarean section. Saline (n = 48) or 20 mg tenoxicam (n = 45) was intravenously injected immediately after clamping the umbilical cord.

RESULTS Tenoxicam profoundly reduced the intensity of uterine cramping pain (3.6 [2.0-5.6] versus 5.5 [3.4-6.6]; p < 0.01) but had no additional effect on wound pain at rest, with movement, changing position, sitting, and walking. Intraoperative injection of 20 mg tenoxicam decreased the demand ratio for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and 24-hour morphine consumption by approximately 30%.; The data show that tenoxicam potentiates opioid analgesic effect on the somatic and visceral types of pain to different extents, and they suggest that intraoperative injection of 20 mg tenoxicam is sufficient to enhance intravenous PCA morphine on uterine cramping pain for the first 24 hours after cesarean section.",3,E

The treatment of chronic pain, a multidimensional disease, should rely on the expertise of varying health care providers and should focus not only on the neurobiological mechanisms of the process but also on the psychosocial aspects of the disease. Implantable devices are costly and invasive, and such efficacious therapies should be used only when more conservative and less costly therapies have failed to provide relief of pain and suffering. Spinal cord stimulation provides neuromodulation of neuropathic, but not nociceptive, pain signals and when used for appropriate indications in the right individuals provides approximately 60-80% long-term pain relief in 60-80% of patients trialled for efficacy. Intrathecal therapies with opioids such as morphine, fentanyl, sufentanil or meperidine--or non-opioids such as clonidine or bupivacaine--provide analgesia in patients with nociceptive or neuropathic pain syndromes.

Unfortunately, older antidepressants have dose-limiting side effects that can lead to drug intolerance. The most common are anticholinergic side effects, although some patients experience sexual dysfunction. Cognitive impairment, sedation, and orthostatic hypotension also are relatively common. Taking an overdose of tricyclic antidepressants can be lethal in overdose. Several weeks of therapy may be required before antinociception occurs, but tricyclic antidepressants in optimal doses appear to be the most effective treatment for neuropathic pain; this is supported by systematic reviews comparing them with other agents. Newer medications such as atypical antidepressants and anticonvulsants may be overtaking older antidepressants, but they should not be overlooked as important options for the management of pain.",3,E

While there are many modalities that can be used in managing the patient in pain, drug treatment remains, for the most part, the cornerstone of treatment. Opioids retain their position as the foundation of most analgesic strategies, although they tend to be used nowadays in combination with adjuvant analgesics such as paracetamol and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The range of available opioids has also been expanded with drugs such as hydromorphone and oxycodone, originally developed almost a century ago. This expanded choice has resulted in the concept of opioid rotation in chronic pain states, an approach that is aimed at maintaining pain control while minimizing adverse effects. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs continue to play an important role, especially as adjuvants, and the development of drugs such as celecoxib and refecoxib, highly specific for the inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 pathway has been a further advance. The treatment of neuropathic pain continues to be a challenge to the clinician. While this has traditionally been treated with drugs from the anticonvulsant, antiarrhythmic and anti-depressant groups, results from these treatments have often been less than satisfactory. This has led to the development of completely new drug classes that modulate neuronal transmission in pain pathways, some of which are derived from exotic animal sources, such as the conotoxins from the marine snail family and epibatidine from a species of frog.

For example, in the general population, several chronic pain conditions are more prevalent among women than among men, and many experimental studies demonstrate lower pain thresholds and tolerances among women. In addition, recent evidence from studies of experimental and acute clinical pain suggests that responses to analgesic medications may differ in women and men.; The sample consisted of 240 patients (35% women) with low back, upper back, or neck pain undergoing evaluation for treatment at a multidisciplinary pain center. The patients were classified as opioid or nonopioid users on the basis of self-report and medical record review. All the patients completed a battery of clinical assessments, including measures of pain severity, psychological adjustment, self-reported disability, functional tasks, and pain tolerance. Analyses were conducted to examine clinical variables as a function of gender and opioid use.; The results indicated that opioid use was associated with greater self-reported disability and poorer function in both women and men. However, the association of opioid use with affective distress differed between women and men. The women using opioids showed lower affective distress, whereas the opioid-using men reported greater affective distress. Opioid use was not associated with pain severity, although the women reported greater pain than men.; These findings indicate that both opioid use and gender are significant predictors of clinical status of patients with chronic spinal pain. More interesting, these two variables interact because opioid use was associated with increased affective distress among the men, but the reverse was true for the women. In addition, the women reported greater pain severity, which is consistent with some previous findings. Potential explanations for these findings are presented, and the practical implications are discussed.",E,E

This difference was statistically significant on days 0, 1, 2, and 3. The ropivacaine group was on all days less effective than the morphine group, better than the placebo group on the operation and first day, but the difference against the placebo group was statistically not significant.; Local application of 5 mg morphine sulfate is effective in prevention or reduction of postoperative lumbar and radicular pain after lumbar disc operations. Ropivacain is less effective. The routine application of epidural morphine at the end of spinal operations can be recommended. It also can be justified to try to prolong the morphine effect by mixing it into a paste as described by Needham and by Hurlbert, and to irrigate the operative field with ropivacaine at the end of the operation.",4,E

Patients received 15 mg bupivacaine plus 2 ml of the test drug intrathecally (saline, 100 microg morphine, or 1-5 microg neostigmine). The control group received spinal saline as the test drug. The morphine group received spinal morphine as test drug. The morphine + 1 microg neostigmine group received spinal morphine and 1 microg neostigmine. The morphine + 2.5 microg neostigmine group received spinal morphine and 2.5 microg neostigmine. Finally, the morphine + 5 microg neostigmine group received spinal morphine and 5 microg neostigmine.; The groups were demographically similar. The time to first rescue analgesic (minutes) was longer for all patients who received intrathecal morphine combined with 1-5 microg neostigmine (median, 6 h) compared with the control group (median, 3 h) (P < 0.02). The morphine group (P < 0.05) and the groups that received the combination of 100 microg intrathecal morphine combined with neostigmine (P < 0.005) required less rescue analgesics in 24 h compared with the control group. The incidence of perioperative adverse effects was similar among groups (P > 0.05).; The addition of 1-5 microg spinal neostigmine to 100 microg morphine doubled the duration to first rescue analgesic in the population studied and decreased the analgesic consumption in 24 h, without increasing the incidence of adverse effects. The data suggest that low-dose spinal neostigmine may improve morphine analgesia.",E,4

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of the NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine on thermal allodynia/hyperalgesia, ongoing pain and mechanical allodynia/hyperalgesia in patients with neuropathic pain (11 patients with post-traumatic neuralgia and one patient with post-herpetic neuralgia). All the patients were known to suffer from severe cold allodynia (cold pain detection threshold (CPDT): 23.8 degrees C, median value). The mu-opioid agonist alfentanil was used as an active control. The study design was double-blind and placebo-controlled and the drugs were administered i.v. (bolus dose and infusion). CPDT in the asymptomatic contralateral area was found to be significantly decreased (cold allodynia) compared to CPDT in site- and age-matched normal controls. Heat pain detection thresholds were found to be normal and no consistent heat hyperalgesia occurred. Alfentanil significantly reduced cold allodynia (by increasing CPDT) in symptomatic area (P=0.0076). Ketamine did not significantly increase the threshold. Significant and marked reductions of hyperalgesia to cold (visual analogue score at threshold value) were seen following both alfentanil (4.5 before, 1.4 after, median value) and ketamine (6.8 before, 0.4 after, median value).

The correct interpretation of results obtained in these models necessitates their mechanistic understanding. This study evaluated the freeze lesion, an experimental model of hyperalgesia, in humans. Twelve healthy subjects were tested with mechanical (brush, punctuated and blunt) and electrical (5, 250, and 2000 Hz sine wave current) stimuli before and after freezing the skin, and during a computer-controlled infusion of the mu-opioid agonist remifentanil targeting five different plasma concentrations between 0 and 6 ng/ml in a two-staged, single occasion, randomized, and double blind study design. Pharmacodynamic modeling techniques were used to describe the effect of freezing and drug administration on the mechanical and electrical pain thresholds. Freezing the skin resulted in hyperalgesia to blunt and punctuated stimuli and lowered the respective pain threshold by 29 and 73%. Hyperalgesia to brushing or electrical stimuli was not detected. Remifentanil attenuated hyperalgesia to blunt stimuli about twice as potently as hyperalgesia to punctuated stimuli, as indicated by a significantly steeper linear relationship between the remifentanil plasma concentration and the increase of the pain threshold to blunt stimuli. Remifentanil attenuated electrical pain with greater potency for low frequency stimulation. The potency difference of remifentanil suggests that different neuronal mechanisms mediate hyperalgesia to blunt and punctuated stimulation. Absence of brush-evoked and electrical hyperalgesia is compatible with the view that mechanical hyperalgesia to blunt and punctuated stimulation of the freeze lesion is predominantly caused by a peripheral mechanism.",2,E

In the postanaesthetic care unit, the patients were randomly allocated to one of two groups to self-administer tramadol or morphine using a patient-controlled analgesia device throughout a 24 h period. The patient-controlled analgesia device was programmed to deliver tramadol 20 mg as an intravenous bolus or morphine 2 mg with a lockout time of 10 min.; Mean cumulative morphine and tramadol consumption were 48.13 +/- 30.23 and 493.5 +/- 191.5 mg, respectively. There was no difference in the quality of analgesia between groups. Five (26.3%) patients in the tramadol group and seven (33%) in the morphine group had nausea, and three of the latter patients vomited. The incidence rate of vomiting with tramadol was 5.2%. All vital signs were within safe ranges. Sedation was less in the tramadol group, but not statistically significant.; In this clinical setting, which includes interpleural morphine pre-emptively, postoperative analgesia provided by tramadol was similar to that of morphine at rest and during deep inspiration.

While immunosuppression, neurotoxicity, teratogenity, tolerance and addiction are clinically not relevant or very rare, cognitive impairment, sedation and obstipation may have a clinical impact.However, these symptoms can usually be managed by adjuvant medication and patient education. Treatment of non-malignant pain with opioids can only be considered on an individual basis. Scientific evidence for general treatment with opioids, treatment of specific pain syndromes or treatment with certain opioids is not available. In conclusion, only recommendations regarding opioid treatment for certain chronic pain syndromes can be made. In only a minority of patients can a long-term analgesic effect be expected.Therefore, careful evaluation of alternative options of pain management is necessary before opioid therapy is started. With standardized documentation responders may be distinguished from non-responders. For clinical practice of long-term opioid therapy in non-malignant pain a specialized knowledge in pain management is a prerequisite. Future studies with more sophisticated methodology will be necessary to advocate more precise guidelines.However, the therapeutic recommendations from the DGSS consensus conference allow a safer,well structured and validated use of opioids for chronic non-malignant pain.",E,E

As job satisfaction and financial security diminish during our economic recession, the impact of the disability epidemic becomes more profound. There often is no direct correlation between objective impairment and a patient's request for disability status. Injured workers maintained on workers' compensation may have an increased risk for developing chronic pain syndromes unresponsive to conventional treatments. These patients may have significant financial, psychosocial, and environmental reinforcement for maintenance of their disability and little incentive to return to work. Excessive pain behavior may lead to unnecessary diagnostic testing or invasive procedures and result in iatrogenic complications and prolonged disability. Patients with chronic pain syndrome who have not had psychosocial treatment may not be at maximum medical improvement. The purpose of this paper is to help the readership identify types of psychiatric, psychologic, and psychosocial issues that can coexist in patients with chronic pain who are applying for disability, and to help treating physicians avoid contributing to iatrogenic pain and disability by performing needless and potentially harmful procedures on patients who may be better served with an emphasis on psychiatric or psychologic care.",5,E

Management of abdominal pain in these patients continues to pose a formidable challenge. The importance of small duct disease without radiographic abnormalities is now a well-established concept. It is meaningful to determine whether patients with chronic pancreatitis have small duct or large duct disease because this distinction has therapeutic implications. Diagnostic evaluation should begin with simple noninvasive and inexpensive tests like serum trypsinogen and fecal elastase, to be followed where appropriate by more complicated measures such as the secretin hormone stimulation test, especially in patients with suspected small duct disease. No universal causal treatment is available. Non-enteric-coated enzyme preparations are useful for treatment of pain, whereas enteric-coated enzyme preparations are preferred for steatorrhea. Octreotide is used increasingly for abdominal pain that is unresponsive to pancreatic enzyme therapy. When medical therapy for chronic pancreatitis pain has failed, endoscopic therapy, endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus block, and thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy, performed by experts, may be considered for a highly selected patient population. Surgical ductal decompression is appropriate in patients with considerable pancreatic ductal dilation.

A total of 43.5% of patients treated with buprenorphine TDS reported good or complete pain relief compared with 32.4% in the placebo group. Pain intensity decreased in a dose-dependent manner with buprenorphine TDS, and the duration of sleep uninterrupted by pain was improved by the end of the study. More than three fourths (78.8%) of patients in the placebo and buprenorphine TDS groups reported at least 1 adverse event (AE) during the study. The most common AEs were central nervous system and gastrointestinal symptoms. The majority of treatment-related AEs were mild or moderate in intensity and were typical of those occurring at the beginning of therapy with a strong opioid.; Buprenorphine TDS was shown to be an effective analgesic against chronic, severe pain in this study population.

It is a complex sensation, with both a sensory and an emotional component. Its detailed regulation at all levels of the central nervous system, from the periphery to the cortex, has hindered our understanding of the neurobiological basis of pain. Furthermore, injury can produce long-lasting changes in pain pathways and chronic pain. The recent use of genetically modified organisms has significantly advanced our comprehension of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying pain. In this article we present the current state of knowledge regarding pain transmission, modulation, and plasticity, and some of the contributions made by studies of genetically altered mice. The cellular mechanisms explaining observed phenotypes, the involvement of supraspinal areas, and the plasticity underlying chronic pain are the three areas just beginning to be explored.",E,E

Heat pain tolerance thresholds at eight dermatomes from S1 to fifth cranial nerve (assessment of segmental spread), pain threshold to transcutaneous repeated electrical stimulation of the sural nerve (assessment of temporal summation) and pain intensity after injection of hypertonic saline into the tibialis anterior muscle (assessment of muscle pain) were recorded.; Fentanyl 100 micro g, but not 50 micro g, produced analgesia to heat stimulation only at L2. Surprisingly, no effect at S1 was detected. Both fentanyl doses significantly increased temporal summation threshold and decreased muscle pain intensity.; The findings suggest that a single lumbar epidural dose of fentanyl should be injected at the spinal interspace corresponding to the dermatomal site of pain. Increased effect on L2 compared with S1 suggests that drug effect on spinal nerve roots and binding to opioid receptors on the dorsal root ganglia may be more important than traditionally believed for the segmental effect of epidurally injected fentanyl. Epidural fentanyl increases temporal summation threshold and could therefore contribute to prevention and treatment of central hypersensitivity states.

Postoperative ileus, although attributable to surgical procedures, is often exacerbated by opioid use during and following surgery. Postoperative ileus is marked by increased inhibitory neural input, heightened inflammatory responses, decreased propulsive movements and increased fluid absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. The use of opioids for chronic pain is characterised by a constellation of symptoms including hard dry stools, straining, incomplete evacuation, bloating, abdominal distension and increased gastroesophageal reflux. The current management of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction among patients receiving opioid analgesics consists primarily of nonspecific ameliorative measures. Intensive investigations into the mode of action of opioids have characterised three opioid receptor classes -mu, delta and kappa- that mediate the myriad of peripheral and central actions of opioids. Activation of mu-opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract is responsible for inhibition of gut motility, whereas receptors in the central nervous system mediate the analgesic actions of opioids. Blocking peripheral opioid receptors in the gut is therefore a logical therapeutic target for managing opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. Available opioid antagonists such as naloxone are of limited use because they are readily absorbed, cross the blood-brain barrier, and act at central opioid receptors to reverse analgesia and elicit opioid withdrawal. Methylnaltrexone and alvimopan are recently developed opioid antagonists with activity that is restricted to peripheral receptors. Both have recently shown the ability to reverse opioid-induced bowel dysfunction without reversing analgesia or precipitating central nervous system withdrawal signs in non-surgical patients receiving opioids for chronic pain. In addition, recent clinical studies with alvimopan suggest that it may normalise bowel function without blocking opioid analgesia in abdominal laparotomy patients with opioid-related postoperative ileus.",E,E

Few controlled trials have been performed, and many types of neuropathic pain remain unstudied.; Adults with neuropathic pain that was refractory to treatment were randomly assigned to receive either high-strength (0.75-mg) or low-strength (0.15-mg) capsules of the potent mu-opioid agonist levorphanol for eight weeks under double-blind conditions. Intake was titrated by the patient to a maximum of 21 capsules of either strength per day. Outcome measures included the intensity of pain as recorded in a diary, the degree of pain relief, quality of life, psychological and cognitive function, the number of capsules taken daily, and blood levorphanol levels.; Among the 81 patients exposed to the study drug, high-strength levorphanol capsules reduced pain by 36 percent, as compared with a 21 percent reduction in pain in the low-strength group (P=0.02). On average, patients in the high-strength group took 11.9 capsules per day (8.9 mg per day) and patients in the low-strength group took close to the 21 allowed (18.3 capsules per day; 2.7 mg per day). Affective distress and interference with functioning were reduced, and sleep was improved, but there were no differences between the high-strength group and the low-strength group in terms of these variables. Noncompletion of the study was primarily due to side effects of the opioid. Patients with central pain after stroke were the least likely to report benefit.; The reduction in the intensity of neuropathic pain was significantly greater during treatment with higher doses of opioids than with lower doses.

The disease is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, as well as acute and chronic complications. One of the most intractable problems encountered by children with SCD is the painful episode that results from tissue ischemia due to vaso-occlusion. Pain related to SCD is unique among pain syndromes due to the unpredictable, recurrent, and often persistent nature of the disease, as well as the recurring and essential need for the use of opioids. Painful vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) are a principal cause of morbidity and account for a significant number of emergency department and hospital admissions. When untreated or inadequately managed, the pain of VOE may cause both short- and long-term consequences. Despite the fact that pain is an almost universal feature of the disease, children with SCD may form one of the most undertreated and understudied populations. One of the factors contributing to poor pain management is conflicting perceptions between patients, their families, and healthcare professionals about pain that is reported and analgesia that is required. Pain management guidelines have recently been published in an effort to overcome barriers in the assessment and management of pain related to SCD. Although there is considerable variability in the way SCD pain is managed, the standard treatment protocol for painful episodes has been rest, rehydration, and analgesia. However, pain control for children with SCD is often a difficult and complex process, and one that requires frequent systematic pain assessments and continuous adjustment of comfort measures, especially analgesics. There are a variety of analgesic agents to choose from, such as acetaminophen (paracetamol), oral or parenteral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and oral or parenteral opioids. Each of these options has advantages and disadvantages to their use. Continuous infusions of analgesics and patient controlled analgesia have been shown to be effective and widely used in hospital settings to manage severe pain. However, the opioid dose required to achieve pain relief varies considerably within each painful episode, from one episode to another, and between individual patients. Although not yet curable in humans, pain related to SCD can be effectively managed in most patients by using a comprehensive approach that incorporates pharmacologic, psychologic, behavioral, and physical pain management strategies.",E,E

The level of CCK and CCK receptors, as well as CKK release, exhibits considerable plasticity after nerve injury and inflammation, conditions known to be associated with chronic pain. Such altered CCK release coupled in some situation with changes in CCK receptor levels may underlie the clinical phenomenon of varying opioid sensitivity in different clinical pain conditions. In particular, neuropathic pain after injury to the peripheral and central nervous system does not respond well to opioids, which is likely to be caused by increased activity in the endogenous CCK system. CCK receptor antagonists may thus be useful as analgesics in combination with opioids to treat neuropathic pain.",E,E

Rescue analgesia consisted of up to two patient-controlled epidural bolus injections per hour (4 ml) and subsequent i.v. morphine, if necessary. All patients received rectal paracetamol 1 g, every 6th hour. Main outcome measures were pain intensity at rest and when coughing, evaluated by a visual analogue scale and an overall quality of pain relief score. The extent of sensory blockade was evaluated by determining dermatomal hypaesthesia to cold.; Pain intensity when coughing increased (P < 0.001) and the number of hypaesthetic dermatomal segments decreased (P < 0.002) when the concentration of adrenaline was reduced below 1.5 micro g.ml- 1 in the triple epidural mixture. This change started within two hours after reducing the concentration of adrenaline below 1.5 micro g.ml- 1. The differences in pain intensities at rest were less pronounced. After 4 h with adrenaline 0.5 or 1.0 micro g.ml- 1 pain intensity when coughing was unacceptable in spite of rescue analgesia. After restarting the standard epidural mixture with adrenaline 2.0 micro g.ml- 1, pain intensity was again reduced to mild pain when coughing and the sensory blockade was restored.

Pain was measured using the COMFORT behavioural scale and a visual analogue scale. Additional morphine was administered on guidance of the pain scores. Morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) plasma concentrations were measured before, directly after, and at 6, 12 and 24 h after surgery.; Multiple regression analysis of different variables revealed that age was the most important factor affecting morphine requirements and plasma morphine concentrations. Significantly fewer neonates required additional morphine doses compared with all other age groups (P<0.001). Method of morphine administration (intermittent vs continuous) had no significant influence on morphine requirements. Neonates had significantly higher plasma concentrations of morphine, M3G and M6G (all P<0.001), and significantly lower M6G/morphine ratio (P<0.03) than the older children. The M6G/M3G ratio was similar in all age groups.; Neonates have a narrower therapeutic window for postoperative morphine analgesia than older age groups, with no difference in the safety or effectiveness of intermittent doses compared with continuous infusions in any of these age groups. In infants >1 month of age, analgesia is achieved after morphine infusions ranging from 10.9 to 12.3 micro g kg(-1) h(-1) at plasma concentrations of <15 ng ml(-1).",6,E

Pain of any type or duration during the past week was reported by 80% of MMTP patients and 78% of inpatients. Among those with chronic severe pain, 65% of MMTP patients and 48% of inpatients reported high levels of pain-related interference in physical and psychosocial functioning. Among MMTP patients, correlates of chronic pain in a multivariate model were age (odds ratio [OR], 2.08; 95% CI, 1.17-3.70), chronic illness (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.07-3.29), lifetime psychiatric illness (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.06-2.97), psychiatric distress (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.22-2.18), and time in treatment (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.06-4.68). Among inpatients, the correlates of chronic pain were race (blacks vs whites: OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31-0.90; Hispanics vs whites: OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24-0.95), drug craving (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.54-5.02), chronic illness (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.37-3.43), and psychiatric distress (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.03-1.81). Among those with chronic severe pain, inpatients were significantly more likely than MMTP patients to have used illicit drugs, as well as alcohol, to treat their pain complaint (51% vs 34%, P =.005) but were less likely to have been prescribed pain medications (52% vs 67%, P =.01).; Chronic severe pain is prevalent among patients in substance abuse treatment, especially MMTP patients. Pain is associated with functional impairment and correlates of pain vary with the population. Self-medication for pain with psychoactive drugs appears especially problematic among substance users who enroll in drug-free treatment programs. Substance abuse treatment programs need to develop comprehensive and structured pain management programs.",E,E

With the application of a lithotriptor of modern version an appropriate yet cost-effective analgesia with minimal side effects for ESWL is mandatory.; The analgesic effect of oral morphine (30 mg) was compared with that of pentazocine (100 mg) in a prospective study comprising 100 patients undergoing ESWL with a lithotripter of improved version for urinary tract stones. All patients received orally lorazepam 1 mg as sedative together with the appointed tested drug 30 min before the procedure. The analgesic effects of both drugs were assessed having recourse to the pain scale and efficacy scale.; There were 94% of patients in the pentazocine (mixed agonist-antagonist) group who felt satisfied with the regimen and stood the procedure well without resort to supplemental drug, as compared with the morphine (potent mu-agonist) group in which only 70% of patients did so. Although the adverse effect such as dizziness was found in the pentazocine group, the degree of sleepiness produced by its deeper sedation effect was to the advantage of patients during the lithotripsy procedure. There were no significant changes in intergroup mean blood pressure (MBP), but heart rate (HR) was higher and O2 saturation (SpO2) was lower in the pentazocine group after treatment. Both narcotics did not induce renal colic in our study. Also, pentazocine 100 mg plus lorazepam 1 mg given orally did not induce psychotomimetic reaction intraoperatively or postoperatively.; We concluded that oral pentazocine at 100 mg plus lorazepam 1 mg, could offer satisfactory analgesia in patients undergoing ESWL for urinary tract stones with a lithotripter of improved version.",4,E

There are no data on the prolonged use of clonidine for postoperative analgesia in children. The primary outcome of this randomized, double-blind trial was to compare the incidence of side-effects after epidural infusion of clonidine or morphine, in association with ropivacaine in children.; After institutional approval, 26 children, aged 3-12 years, who were scheduled for abdominal surgery, had an epidural catheter placed after induction of general anaesthesia. Patients were then randomized to two different groups. After an initial bolus of 2.5 mg x kg-1 0.25% ropivacaine with either 40 micro g x kg-1 morphine (group M, n = 14) or 1 micro g x kg-1 clonidine (group C, n = 12), an epidural infusion was started at a rate of 0.4 ml x kg-1 x h-1. The patients in the M group received an infusion of 0.08% ropivacaine with 10 micro g.ml-1 morphine, those in the group C an infusion of 0.08% ropivacaine with 0.6 micro g.ml-1 clonidine.; The two groups were similar with respect to age, sex and weight. One patient in the C group was excluded for misplacement of the epidural catheter. The incidence of vomiting and pruritus was significantly higher in the M group compared with the C group (64% and 85% versus 0%, respectively). The incidence of pain was significantly higher in the C group compared with the M group (73% versus 29%) as well as the need for rescue analgesia medications.; Epidural clonidine is followed by a significantly lower incidence of side-effects. However, its analgesic effects, at least at the doses used in this study, are less potent than those of epidural morphine.",4,E

The primary outcome variable was cumulative time to discontinuation (Kaplan-Meier analysis). Secondary measures at the end of the study included pain, pain relief, total tender points, myalgia, health status, and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire scores.; Of the 315 subjects who were enrolled in the study, 313 (294 women [94%], mean [+/- SD] age, 50 +/- 10 years) completed at least one postrandomization efficacy assessment (tramadol/acetaminophen: n = 156; placebo: n = 157). Discontinuation of treatment for any reason was less common in those treated with tramadol/acetaminophen compared with placebo (48% vs. 62%, P = 0.004). Tramadol/acetaminophen-treated subjects also had significantly less pain at the end of the study (53 +/- 32 vs. 65 +/- 29 on a visual analog scale of 0 to 100, P <0.001), and better pain relief (1.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 0.8 +/- 1.3 on a scale of -1 to 4, P <0.001) and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire scores (P = 0.008).

Analgesics, such as acetaminophen, narcotics, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are commonly used to treat ECT-induced headache. The objective of this study was to determine whether pretreatment with ibuprofen would prevent the onset or decrease the severity of headache that occurs after ECT.; All inpatients on the psychiatric units who required ECT treatment were asked to participate in the study. Thirty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive either ibuprofen, 600 mg, or placebo orally 90 minutes prior to the initial ECT session, with the alternate treatment given for the second ECT treatment. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire prior to and after the first 2 ECT treatments regarding the pattern, severity, and onset of headache. Severity of the headache was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS).; Ten patients experienced headache in neither treatment arm, while 7 patients experienced headache in both treatment arms. Eleven patients experienced headache with placebo but not with ibuprofen, while 2 patients experienced headache with ibuprofen but not with placebo. Ibuprofen was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing the onset of headache post-ECT (p =.022). The mean +/- SD VAS headache scores were 1.49 +/- 1.54 and 0.54 +/- 0.91 in the placebo and ibuprofen arms, respectively. Ibuprofen was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of ECT-induced headache (p =.007).; Ibuprofen premedication reduced the frequency and severity of headache post-ECT and should be considered for appropriate patients who suffer from ECT-induced headache.",3,E

However, MMT still remains controversial. In Hennepin County, Minnesota, methadone is one of the top ten drugs reported in medical examiner investigated deaths and one of the most commonly diverted pharmaceuticals. This report reviews the role of methadone in medical examiner deaths over a 10-year period, 1992-2002. We compare cause and manner of death (accidental, natural, suicide) and methadone blood concentrations for decedents who were members of MMT programs with illicit users and those prescribed methadone for chronic pain. Findings reveal that 65% of decedents with measurable blood methadone concentrations were not participating in MMT programs. A total of 96 cases were identified, with the majority white (90.5%) and male (76.8%). MMTP program members were the minority (34.7%) of the methadone positive deaths and 39% were illicit users. Fifteen percent were chronic pain patients with almost half of this group dying from overdose. Methadone concentrations of drug caused/related deaths (0.18-3.99 mg/L) overlapped with those of deaths not attributable to methadone (0.18-3.03 mg/L) with no definable lethal level. Interpretation of methadone blood concentrations must be done in the context of the clinical history for determining cause of death, and may be confounded by postmortem redistribution.",I,I

The interval between each bolus was 5 min. The visual analog scale (VAS) score threshold required to administer morphine was 30, and pain relief was defined as a VAS score of 30 or less.; Data from 3,045 patients were analyzed. The mean initial VAS score was 73 +/- 19 (mean +/- SD), and the mean morphine dose required to obtain pain relief was 0.17 +/- 0.10 mg/kg, i.e., a median of four boluses (range, 1-20). When patients were grouped according to several classes of initial VAS score (31-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90-100), it seemed that the relationship between VAS score and morphine requirements was a sigmoid curve. A VAS score of 70 or greater predicted the need for a high (>0.15 mg/kg) morphine dose (sensitivity, 0.77; specificity, 0.54). During the pain relief process, the relationship between VAS score and time was depicted by a sigmoid curve.; A VAS score of 70 or greater should be considered indicative of severe pain.

Interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-1ra, and interleukin-10 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Also, recovery from anesthesia and physical/mental well-being (SF-36 questionnaire) were determined perioperatively. Compared with control patients, atenolol-treated patients experienced improved postoperative physical well-being, which paralleled the previously reported faster recovery from anesthesia and a decreased need for perioperative analgesics. Improved postoperative physical well-being of atenolol-treated patients was specifically caused by an ameliorated bodily pain score, a major component of the physical composite score of the SF-36 questionnaire. The cytokine response of these elderly surgical patients was similar to that of younger patients, and the perioperative profile of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines was not affected by atenolol.; Perioperative administration of atenolol to elderly surgical patients markedly improves physical sense of well-being, which coincides with improved postoperative pain control and decreased analgesic requirements. This improvement experienced by patients receiving atenolol is not related to alterations in perioperative cytokine response.",3,E

This review summarizes the published literature on sex differences in analgesia produced by acute administration of drugs acting at mu-, kappa-, and delta-opioid receptors, in animals and humans. Additionally, methodological issues in research into opioid sex differences are discussed.; Procedural variables that may influence the outcome of studies examining sex differences in opioid analgesia include modality and intensity of the noxious stimulus used in the pain test, opioid type (efficacy and selectivity), and experimental design and data analytic techniques. Subject variables that may be important to consider include subject genotype and gonadal steroid hormone state of the subject at the time of analgesia testing. Evidence is provided for multiple mechanisms underlying sex differences in opioid analgesia, including both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors. Future research directions are suggested, such as examining sex differences in opioid tolerance development, sex differences in opioid analgesia using models of acute inflammatory pain and chronic pain, and sex differences in effects of opioids other than analgesia, which may limit their therapeutic use.",E,E
12799971,[Effect on morphine and other opioids on immune function].,NA,"Ernst, G; Pfaffenzeller, P","Already 1898 first clinical observations of a possible immune suppression after morphine intake were published. Today there are many reports describing opioid effects on nearly all parameters of the immune system. The question arises, whether there exists any evidence for clinical (harming) effects on patients.; Recent experimental and clinical publications are reviewed. Results are summarized, pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical conclusions discussed.; Morphine and other opioids have immunomodulating effects on nearly all measurable parts of the immune system (macrophages, granulocytes, nk-cells; mediators like Interleukin 1, 2 and 6, TNF). However, most studies did not include pain models, and in addition, high morphine doses were used. First studies using a combined pain/morphine-approach report immune stimulating effects. There are three pathophysiological mechanisms under discussion, including opioid receptors on immune competent cells, central opioid receptors activating the adrenergic system and opioid-induced steroid release with consecutive immunosuppression. It is completely unclear, if there is any relevance of these findings for clinical settings.; The question whether use of opioids can harm chronic pain patients is unsolved. There is an urgent need for studies in clinical settings with clinical relevant parameters.",E,E
12799972,[Hydromorphone--review of pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy with special regard to a controlled release preparation].,NA,"Lindena, G; Arnau, H; Liefhold, J","Hydromorphone is a micro receptor agonist opioid. According to WHO recommendations, hydromorphone is to be classified in step III of pain therapy. An oral formulation with a prolonged duration of action of 12 hours has been evaluated only recently. The controlled release capsule is especially suited for the regular twice a day administration in cases of severe and persistent pain. The oral formulation of hydromorphone increases the number of opioid analgesics available for pain therapy in step III. Hydromorphone is recommended when morphine fails to produce sufficient pain relief (despite increase of doses) or causes intolerable side effects (despite treatment of symptoms). In principle, no differences in efficacy of morphine and hydromorphone are to be expected. However, clinical experience shows that changing one opioid analgesic to another one can improve the treatment of patients so that hydromorphone may replace another opioid analgesic to which a patient fails to respond well or develops side effects. The dose of hydromorphone equivalent to 2 times 30 mg controlled release morphine is about 2 times 4 mg. The values for the absorption, bioavailability and maximum plasma concentration after the administration of controlled release hydromorphone every 12 hours -of three times the dose- are equivalent to those of an immediate release tablet given every 4 hours. In several open label and controlled studies, hydromorphone proved to be of good efficacy in the treatment of acute and persistent pain, especially in patients with severe cancer pain. With regard to the incidence of side effects, no significant differences between morphine and hydromorphone could be established. In general, the side effects of hydromorphone are typical for opioid analgesics.; In conclusion, controlled release hydromorphone seems to be well suited for the control of severe chronic pain when given twice daily.",E,E

Pain that persists in the region where this rash occurred after the cutaneous lesions have healed is termed postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). A wide variety of therapies has been used with varying degrees of success to prevent the occurrence of PHN and to reduce pain with established PHN.; In this review, we discuss the clinical presentation of PHN, current strategies for the prevention and management of this disease, and observations that have increased our understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in PHN.; Several classes of drugs are effective in attenuating the pain and hyperalgesia caused by PHN, but no single drug leads to the complete relief of symptoms. Additional research is needed to improve treatment strategies and define the role of invasive pain management techniques in cases where PHN is associated with intractable pain.",E,E
12801599,Induction of pain facilitation by sustained opioid exposure: relationship to opioid antinociceptive tolerance.,"Analgesics, Opioid; Animals; Cholecystokinin; Drug Tolerance; Humans; Medulla Oblongata; Pain; Pain Measurement","Ossipov, Michael H; Lai, Josephine; Vanderah, Todd W; Porreca, Frank","Opioid analgesics are frequently used for the long-term management of chronic pain states, including cancer pain. The prolonged use of opioids is associated with a requirement for increasing doses to manage pain at a consistent level, reflecting the phenomenon of analgesic tolerance. It is now becoming clearer that patients receiving long-term opioid therapy can develop unexpected abnormal pain. Such paradoxical opioid-induced pain, as well as tolerance to the antinociceptive actions of opioids, has been reliably measured in animals during the period of continuous opioid delivery. Several recent studies have demonstrated that such pain may be secondary to neuroplastic changes that result, in part, from an activation of descending pain facilitation mechanisms arising from the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). One mechanism which may mediate such pain facilitation is through the increased activity of CCK in the RVM. Secondary consequences from descending facilitation may be produced. For example, opioid-induced upregulation of spinal dynorphin levels seem to depend on intact descending pathways from the RVM reflecting spinal neuroplasticity secondary to changes at supraspinal levels. Increased expression of spinal dynorphin reflects a trophic action of sustained opioid exposure which promotes an increased pain state. Spinal dynorphin may promote pain, in part, by enhancing the evoked release of excitatory transmitters from primary afferents. In this regard, opioids also produce trophic actions by increasing CGRP expression in the dorsal root ganglia. Increased pain elicited by opioids is a critical factor in the behavioral manifestation of opioid tolerance as manipulations which block abnormal pain also block antinociceptive tolerance. Manipulations that have blocked enhanced pain and antinociceptive tolerance include reversible and permanent ablation of descending facilitation from the RVM. Thus, opioids elicit systems-level adaptations resulting in pain due to descending facilitation, upregulation of spinal dynorphin and enhanced release of excitatory transmitters from primary afferents. Adaptive changes produced by sustained opioid exposure including trophic effects to enhance pain transmitters suggest the need for careful evaluation of the consequences of long-term opioid administration to patients.",E,E

The authors used a new experimental pain model in human skin to determine the time course of analgesic and hyperalgesic effects of the mu-receptor agonist remifentanil alone or in combination with the N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor antagonist S-ketamine or the alpha(2)-receptor agonist clonidine.; Thirteen volunteers were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation at a high current density (2 Hz, 67.3 +/- 16.8 mA, mean +/- SD) induced acute pain (numerical 11-point rating scale: 5-6 out of 10) and stable areas of mechanical hyperalgesia to punctate stimuli and touch (allodynia). The magnitude of pain and area of hyperalgesia were assessed before, during, and after drug infusion (remifentanil at 0.1 microg x kg-1 x min-1 and S-ketamine at 5 microg x kg-1 x min-1 over a period of 30 min, respectively; clonidine infusion at 2 microg/kg for 5 min).; Remifentanil reduced pain and areas of punctate hyperalgesia during infusion. In contrast, postinfusion pain and hyperalgesia were significantly higher than control. During infusion of S-ketamine, pain and hyperalgesia decreased and gradually normalized after infusion. When given in combination, S-ketamine abolished postinfusion increase of punctate hyperalgesia but did not reduce increased pain ratings. Clonidine alone did not significantly attenuate pain or areas of hyperalgesia. However, when given in combination with remifentanil, clonidine attenuated postinfusion increase of pain ratings.; Opioid-induced postinfusion hyperalgesia could be abolished by S-ketamine, suggesting an N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor mechanism. In contrast, elevated pain ratings after infusion were not reduced by ketamine but were alleviated by the alpha(2)-receptor agonist clonidine. The results of this study suggest different mechanisms of opioid-induced postinfusion antianalgesia and secondary hyperalgesia.",3,E

It requires a determination of the type of pain syndrome (i.e. nociceptive, neuropathic or mixed). Complete pain assessment also requires an understanding of other dimensions of suffering that a patient may be experiencing on psychological, social and spiritual/existential levels. The World Health Organization has introduced a three-step approach to treating pain. Opioids are the mainstay of therapy for moderate to severe pain at the end of life. Familiarity with the pharmacokinetics, equianalgesic dose and adverse effects of opioids is necessary for their safe and effective use. In addition, adjuvant analgesics such as antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants and local anaesthetics are often needed to optimise pain control, especially in patients with neuropathic pain. Given the complex aetiology of pain states, combinations of classes of adjuvants may sometimes be needed for effective treatment.",E,E

This study was powered to compare recovery times (RT) and procedural distress as measured by the Observational Score of Behavioral Distress-revised (OSBD-r; range: 0-23.5 with 23.5 representing maximal distress).; We conducted a prospective, partially-blinded controlled comparative trial comparing intravenous P/F with K/M in a convenience sample of 113 patients aged 3 to 18 years old undergoing orthopedic procedural sedation. All medications were administered by the intermittent intravenous bolus method. An independent sedation nurse recorded total sedation time and RT. Effectiveness was measured using 6 parameters: 1) patient distress as assessed by independent blinded observers after videotape review using the OSBD-r; 2) orthopedic satisfaction score (Likert scale 1-5); 3) sedation nurse satisfaction score (Likert 1-5); 4) parental perception of procedural pain using a 0 to 100 mm Visual Analog Scale with the upper limit being ""most pain""; 5) patient recall of the procedure; and 6) 1 to 3 week follow-up.; RT and total sedation time were significantly less in the P/F group than in the K/M group (33.4 minutes vs 23.2 minutes). The mean OSBD-r scores during manipulation were 0.084 and 0.278 for the K/M and P/F groups, respectively. Although this difference was statistically significant (95% confidence interval for the mean difference -0.34 to -0.048), both regimens were successful in keeping the scores low. There was no statistical difference between the groups in the other measures of effectiveness. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in the occurrence of desaturation and late side effects.; RT with P/F is shorter than with K/M. P/F is comparable to K/M in reducing procedural distress associated with painful orthopedic procedures in the pediatric emergency department. Although propofol has a greater potential of respiratory depression and airway obstruction as compared with ketamine, it offers some unique advantages including a quicker offset and smoother recovery profile.",3,E
12839235,Current concepts in acute pain management.,"Acute Disease; Analgesics, Opioid; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Drug Combinations; Drug Interactions; Facial Pain; Humans","Huynh, Mai-Phuong; Yagiela, John A","Analgesics most commonly prescribed in dentistry for acute pain relief include the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, acetaminophen, and various opioid-containing analgesic combinations. The NSAIDs and presumably acetaminophen act by inhibiting cyclooxgenase enzymes responsible for the formation of prostaglandins that promote pain and inflammation. Opioids such as codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone stimulate endogenous opioid receptors to bring about analgesic and other effects. Numerous clinical studies have confirmed that moderate to severe pain of dental origin is best managed through the use of ibuprofen or another NSAID whose maximum analgesic effect is at least equal to that of standard doses of acetaminophen-opioid combinations. If an NSAID cannot be prescribed because of patient intolerance, analgesic preparations that combine effective doses of an orally active opioid with 600 to 1,000 mg of acetaminophen are preferred in the healthy adult. On occasion, prescribing both an NSAID and an acetaminophen-opioid combination may be helpful in patients not responding to a single product. In all cases, however, the primary analgesic should be taken on a fixed schedule, not on a ""prn"" (or as needed) basis, which only guarantees the patient will experience pain.",E,E

For example, solicitous responses from spouses have been associated with greater levels of pain and disability among patients with chronic pain. However, few investigators have determined whether spousal solicitousness produces different effects in women versus men with chronic pain. The present study examined pain reports, medication use, psychosocial factors, functional measures, and pain tolerance in patients with chronic pain.; Subjects included 114 female and 213 male chronic pain patients, who described their spouses as either high or low in solicitousness on the Multidimensional Pain Inventory. Measures of pain severity, affective distress, physical function, medication use, and pain tolerance were examined in women and men with high versus low scores on spousal solicitousness.; Among males only, high spousal solicitousness was associated with greater numerical ratings of pain and greater self-reported disability compared with patients with low solicitous spouses. Among females only, the high spousal solicitousness patients showed lower pain tolerance, greater pain-related interference, poorer performance on functional tasks (eg, timed walking, lifting, and carrying tasks), and greater use of opioid medications. In both women and men, spousal solicitousness was associated with higher scores on the MPI pain severity scale.; These results extend previous findings demonstrating a relationship between spousal responses and patients' adjustment to pain; however, the pattern of these effects appears to be moderated by the sex of the patient.

To test whether oral opioid treatment causes abnormal pituitary function we prospectively assessed pituitary function in 37 patients with chronic pain who were receiving either oral opioid analgesia or non-opioid analgesia. Oral opioid treatment was not associated with abnormal pituitary function although a few patients had abnormal results mainly related to obesity. Our results suggest that patients with chronic pain who have abnormal endocrine results should have a complete assessment, since abnormal test results cannot be attributed to their analgesia.",E,E

The aim of this long-term prospective study was to evaluate the cognitive impact of oral sustained release morphine in patients with non-cancer pain. A battery of neuropsychological tests to explore attention, psychomotor speed and memory was administered. The effects of morphine on pain, quality of life, mood, subjective memory impairment and side-effects were also investigated. Evaluations were performed at baseline in patients free from opioids and then after 3, 6 and 12 months. Twenty-eight patients were included: 18 received oral sustained morphine (range 40-140 mg/day), ten patients stopped morphine prematurely because of side-effects or insufficient pain relief and were followed as a control group. There was no impairment of any neuropsychological variable over time in the morphine treated patients in comparison with the control group. Two measures of information processing speed - the Stroop interference score and the digit symbol test were improved at 6 and 12 months and there were significant correlations with the pain relief and improvement of mood. Self-reported memory impairment improved notably in responders to morphine. Morphine induced persisting effects on pain, and to a lesser extent on quality of life and mood. The visual analog scale score for side-effects increased at 12 months and essentially consisted of gastrointestinal disorders. This study demonstrates that 12 months treatment with oral morphine does not disrupt cognitive functioning in patients with chronic non-cancer pain and instead results in moderate improvement of some aspects of cognitive functioning, as a consequence of the pain relief and concomitant improvement of well-being and mood.",I,I

The cause of FMS is unknown and its risk factors are poorly understood. It occurs frequently in the general population where it is often co-morbid with other rheumatoid and pain disorders, and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression, making diagnosis particularly difficult. Several types of drugs are used to treat FMS, but none are specifically approved for this indication. FMS appears to be strongly associated with depression or at least with some symptoms of depression, and antidepressants appear to be effective in the treatment of this disorder.

Adverse events were those most commonly expected from an opioid, and most were of mild-to-moderate intensity.; The primary purpose of this study was to preliminarily test the effectiveness of the new formulations of oxycodone/acetaminophen with reduced acetaminophen in the clinical practice setting. The results from this trial suggest that these formulations are effective in the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic LBP. Most patients (67%) reported significant pain relief/tolerable side effects with a TID dosing frequency or less (mean: 3.04 doses/day), suggesting chronic pain patients can experience meaningful pain relief with around-the-clock dosing of oxycodone/acetaminophen and minimal risk of hepatotoxicity. Further long-term, controlled studies of the efficacy/safety of the new formulations of oxycodone/acetaminophen in LBP are warranted to fully characterize efficacy in this patient population and corroborate the findings from our study.",3,E

Patients who were tolerant of oral medications and without signs of paralytic ileus were converted to oral CR oxycodone, given every 12 hours for up to 7 days.; The mean (+/-SE) conversion factor used to convert IV PCA morphine to CR oxycodone was 1.2 +/- 0.1 (N=159). The initial CR oxycodone doses, based on individual conversion factors from IV PCA morphine, produced significant reductions in pain intensity (scores <or=4) within 6 hours after the initial dose. The mean +/- SE initial dose of CR oxycodone, for patients converted from IV PCA morphine, was 27 +/- 1 mg; that for all patients was 29 +/- 2 mg. Pain at the end of the first 12 hours was controlled with these initial doses. The most common adverse events were constipation, nausea, and pruritus.; Administered at least 12 hours following abdominal, orthopedic, or gynecologic surgery, an initial oral CR oxycodone dose calculated by multiplying the amount of IV morphine used in the previous 24 hours (immediate postoperative period) by a conversion factor of 1.2, on average, provided adequate pain control during the subsequent 12-hour dosing interval and for a maximum of 7 days. Adverse events were consistent with opioid side effects.",E,E

The patient failed multiple therapeutic modalities both conservative and interventional, including numerous spinal injections and placement of a spinal cord stimulator. Finally, an intrathecal morphine pump was placed to control his pain in addition to oral pain medications. The course of the treatment included adding a muscle relaxant, tizanidine (Zanaflex), to control spasms in the lower extremities. Six weeks after starting tizanidine, a large pleural effusion was noted incidentally on a computerized tomography scan of the thoracic and lumbar spine. The patient underwent work-up for the pleural effusion; all tests came back negative. Finally, a drug reaction to tizanidine was suspected. The drug was discontinued, and 4 weeks later the pleural effusion resolved.",3,E

This prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study was designed to test the hypothesis that a reduction in postoperative morphine consumption can be achieved by tramadol administered after induction of anaesthesia.; Ninety patients were allocated randomly to receive i.v. tramadol (1 mg kg(-1)) (Group T), morphine (0.1 mg kg(-1)) (Group M) or saline 2 ml (Group S) after induction of anaesthesia. At peritoneal closure, a standardized (0.1 mg kg(-1)) morphine loading dose was given to all patients for postoperative pain management. Patients were allowed to use a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device giving bolus doses of morphine 0.025 mg kg(-1). Discomfort, sedation, pain scores, cumulative morphine consumption, and side-effects were recorded at 1, 2, 6, 12 and 24 h after the start of PCA.; There were no significant differences between groups in mean pain, discomfort, and sedation scores at any study period. Cumulative morphine consumption was significantly lower in Group M at 12 and 24 h after starting the PCA than in Group S. In Group T, it was lower only after 24 h (28% less in Group M and 17% less in Group T; P<0.017). There were no significant differences in morphine consumption between Groups T and M.; Tramadol (1 mg kg(-1)), administered after induction of anaesthesia, offered equivalent postoperative pain relief, and similar recovery times and postoperative PCA morphine consumption compared with giving morphine 0.1 mg kg(-1). These results also suggest that presurgical exposure to systemic opioid analgesia may not result in clinically significant benefits .",4,E

Opioid-induced nausea and vomiting is known to impair patients' satisfaction, but there are no studies providing sufficient power to test the hypothesis that the incidence of opioid-induced nausea and vomiting differs between micro -opioid receptor agonists. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that the incidence of vomiting and nausea differs between morphine and piritramide.; In a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion, we administered either morphine (n=250) or piritramide (n=250) by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for postoperative pain relief. We used a bolus dose of 1.5 mg with a lockout time of 10 min. Incidence and intensity (numerical rating scale) of postoperative nausea, vomiting, pain, patient satisfaction (score 0-10), side-effects (score 0-3) and drug consumption were measured.; Mean drug consumption did not differ between the piritramide and morphine groups (30.8 (SD 22.4) mg day(-1) vs 28.4 (21.8) mg day(-1)) during the first postoperative day and there were no significant differences in the overall incidence of nausea (30% vs 27%) and vomiting (19% vs 15%). Intensity of nausea correlated inversely (P=0.01) with morphine consumption but not with piritramide consumption. Pain scores both at rest (2.2 (1.9) vs 2.6 (2)) and during movement (4.4 (2.2) vs 4.9 (2.3)) were slightly but significantly less with morphine.; Opioid-induced emesis was observed in about one-third of the patients using morphine and piritramide for PCA and the incidence of vomiting was one-half of that. Potential differences in the incidence of vomiting during PCA therapy between these micro-opioid receptor agonists can be excluded.",4,E

Among children, we compare treatment between pediatric and nonpediatric facilities.; Analysis of the ED component of the National Center for Health Statistics National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for 1997 through 2000 was conducted. The proportion of patients with closed extremity and clavicular fracture that received any analgesic and narcotic analgesic medications was determined for each age category. Survey-adjusted regression analyses compared pain and narcotic medications by age and ED type (pediatric versus other). Analyses were repeated for the subset of patients with moderate or severe pain severity scores.; Of 2,828 patients with isolated closed fractures of the extremities or clavicle, 64% received any analgesic and 42% received a narcotic analgesic.

The anaesthetic and postoperative analgesic techniques were standardised. Pain was assessed using a numeric rating scale (0-10) and patients requirements for postoperative morphine, paracetamol and ibuprofen was recorded. The effect of music on nausea, fatigue and anxiety was also investigated. The results showed that patients exposed to music intra-operatively or postoperatively reported significantly lower pain intensity at 1 and 2 h postoperatively and patients in the postoperative music group required less morphine at 1 h compared to the control group. No differences were noted in the other variables.

In group II (n = 17), patients received an initial loading dose of 20 ml bupivacaine 0.125% and a supplemental continuous infusion of 8 ml/h. In group III (n = 17), a loading dose of 20 mg tramadol with 20 ml bupivacaine 0.125% were given and a supplemental infusion of 1 mg/ml tramadol in 20 ml bupivacaine 0.125% combination was begun with a rate of 8 ml/h.

Each patient completed a telephone-based survey measuring symptomatic pain before and after SOM +/- ES. The questioner was blinded to the results of SOM. The patients with normal SOM or SOD but who did not undergo ES served as controls.; Of these 33 patients (27 women, mean age 48.7 yr, range 13-74), 19 (57.5%) were found to have SOD (12 biliary, six pancreatic, one both). The average follow-up was 18.1 months (range 7-34). Of the patients with SOD, 17 (89%) underwent ES. At follow-up of the 19 patients undergoing ES, five were taking narcotics for persistent pain, two were taking antidepressants, and 15 identified the endoscopic therapy as the reason for their relief. Of the 14 controls, seven were taking narcotics, seven were taking antidepressants, and two identified the endoscopy as the reason for their relief; some patients were taking both antidepressants and narcotics.; Patients found to have SOD who undergo ES are more likely to be improved on long-term follow-up when compared with patients with suspected SOD but normal manometry without ES. However, almost uniformly, despite ES, patients continue to have pain, which is consistent with most chronic pain disorders and which suggests a multifactorial cause for the pain.",E,E

Tramadol causes less respiratory depression than morphine at recommended doses. Its efficacy and low incidence of side effects lead to its unnecessary prescribing in patients with mild pain. Tramadol was classified as a ""controlled drug"" long after its approval for use in Jordan. Analysis of drugs of abuse in hair has been used in routine forensic toxicology as an alternative to blood in studying addiction history of drug abusers. A method for the determination of tramadol in hair using solid phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is presented, the method offers excellent precision (3.5-9.8%, (M)=6.77%), accuracy (6.9-12%, M=9.4%) and limit of detection 0.5 ng/mg. The recovery was in the range of 87-94.3% with an average of 90.75%. The calibration curve was linear over the concentration range 0.5-5.0 ng/mg hair with correlation coefficient of 0.998. The developed method was tested on 11 hair samples taken from patients using tramadol as prescribed by their physician along with other different drugs in treating chronic illnesses.

The developed method has the potential of being applied in forensic drug hair testing. In Jordan, hair drug testing started to draw the attention of legal authorities which stimulated forensic toxicologists in recent years to develop methods of analysis of drugs known or have the potential to be abused.",E,E

A randomised, double-blind, cross-over study in ten right-handed volunteers was performed evaluating the influence of cholecystokinin (CCK)-excretion on the perception of pain in a standardised model. CCK-excretion was induced by a liquid formula diet with either long- or medium-chain triglycerides (LCT, MCT). Plasma samples were drawn over a 60 min period in 15-min intervals and CCK and somatostatin (SMS) were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Gastric emptying was evaluated by C-13-breath testing. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation at a high current density (5 Hz, 70.1+/-5.8 mA) was used to provoke acute pain and stable areas of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia and pinprick allodynia for 2 h. Ongoing pain ratings as well as extension of pinprick-hyperalgesia and allodynia were compared between both liquid formula diets. In a second series of experiments, alfentanil (4.1+/-0.5 mg) was administered for 90 min using target-controlled infusions and measurements were performed as stated above. Oral administration of LCT as well as MCT may lead to different CCK blood levels, but we found no evidence for CCK-induced effects on pain sensation, touch-evoked allodynia, secondary hyperalgesia or morphine-induced anti-nociception in humans. In our studies, liquid formula diets did not influence acute pain perception or the efficacy of opioids in a human model of pain.",3,E

The management of chronic pain should be directed by the underlying cause of the pain. Whatever the cause, the primary goal of patient care should be symptom control. 2. Opioid treatment should be considered for both continuous neuropathic and nociceptive pain if other reasonable therapies fail to provide adequate analgesia within a reasonable timeframe. 3. The aim of opioid treatment is to relieve pain and improve the patient's quality of life. Both of these should be assessed during a trial period. 4. The prescribing physician should be familiar with the patient's psychosocial status. 5. The use of sustained-release opioids administered at regular intervals is recommended. 6. Treatment should be monitored. 7. A contract setting out the patient's rights and responsibilities may help to emphasize the importance of patient involvement. 8.

For these patients an alternative opioid is recommended. One such alternative is the potent mu opioid agonist fentanyl, delivered in a transdermal controlled release formulation. Similar to morphine, transdermal fentanyl is effective for the management of moderate to severe cancer pain. However, inappropriate prescribing of transdermal fentanyl, particularly in the clinical setting of unstable pain, can cause significant opioid toxicity, as highlighted in the case reports described.",E,E

Eighty patients undergoing major abdominal surgical procedures were prospectively and randomly treated with one of the above-mentioned analgesic methods. Evaluation of pain perception was done using the visual analogue pain score and the simple descriptive scale 4 hours after the procedure, in the early morning on postoperative day 1 and in the afternoon on postoperative days 1, 2 and 3. The need for supplementary analgesia and the onset of complications, if any, were also evaluated for each patient. Patient-controlled intravenous morphine yielded the best analgesic effect over the entire period. Epidural morphine was more effective in the very early postoperative period compared to modalities (b) and (d). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, on the other hand, were more effective on the later postoperative days. None of the patients in group C needed supplementary analgesia, as against 20% in group A, 55% in group B and 40% in group D.

We aimed to establish the meaning to patients of declines in pain intensity and percent pain reduction. Upon arrival to the postanesthesia care unit, postsurgical patients rated their baseline pain intensity on both a 0-10 NRS and on a 4-point verbal scale. Patients whose NRS was higher than 4/10 received intravenous opioids until their pain intensity declined to 4/10 or lower. During opioid titration, patients were asked every 10 min to rate pain intensity on a NRS and to indicate the degree of pain improvement on a 5-point Likert scale from 'no improvement' to 'complete pain relief'. Seven hundred adult patients were enrolled. For patients with moderate pain, a decrease of 1.3 units (20% reduction) corresponded to 'minimal' improvement, a decrease of 2.4 (35% reduction) to 'much' improvement, a decrease of 3.5 units (45% reduction) corresponded to 'very much' improvement. For patients with severe pain, the decrease in NRS pain score and the percentage of pain relief had to be larger to obtain similar degrees of pain relief. The change in pain intensity that is meaningful to patients increases as the severity of their baseline pain increases. The present findings are applicable in the clinical setting and research arena to assess treatment efficacy.",E,E

Therefore, the authors investigated the efficacy of a continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.25% or 0.5%, at the median sternotomy site, for 48 h after cardiac surgery in reducing the opioid analgesic requirement and improving the recovery process.; In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, 36 consenting patients undergoing open-heart surgery with a standardized general anesthetic technique had two indwelling infusion catheters placed at the median sternotomy incision site at the end of surgery. The patients were randomly assigned to receive normal saline (control), bupivacaine 0.25% or bupivacaine 0.5% via an elastomeric infusion pump at a constant rate of 4 ml/h for 48 h. Patients evaluated their chest pain using an 11-point verbal rating scale, with 0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain imaginable. In addition, the postoperative opioid analgesic requirements and opioid-related adverse effects were recorded. Patient satisfaction with their pain management was assessed at specific intervals during the postoperative period using a 100-point verbal rating scale, with 1 = highly dissatisfied to 100 = highly satisfied. Finally, serum bupivacaine concentrations were measured 24 and 48 h after surgery.; Compared with the control group, there was a statistically significant reduction in verbal rating scale pain scores and patient-controlled analgesia morphine use in the bupivacaine-0.5% group. Patient satisfaction with their pain management was also improved in the bupivacaine-0.5% (vs. control) group. However, there were no significant differences in patient-controlled analgesia morphine use between the bupivacaine-0.25% and control groups. Although the duration of the intensive care unit stay (30 vs. 34 h, respectively) was not significantly decreased, the time to ambulation (1 +/- 0.5 vs. 2 +/- 1 days, respectively) and the duration of hospital stay (4.2 vs. 5.7 days, respectively) were lower in the bupivacaine-0.5% group than in the control group.

Sufentanil, 60 microg, was infused intravenously over 6 h, then 48 h later, the pump was implanted subcutaneously in the upper arm under local anesthesia. Pumps were removed 9 days later. In six volunteers, fever (1.6-3.3 degrees C) was induced with interleukin-2. Plasma was sampled and population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed to estimate in vivo release rate and absorption half-life. Bioavailability was calculated by comparing in vivo to in vitro release rates. The impact of perturbations in release rate on sufentanil plasma concentration (Cp) was simulated.; Fever had no systematic effect on Cp. Release rate estimated in vivo was similar to that measured in vitro; bioavailability did not differ from 100%. Absorption half-life was 16.2 h. Simulation demonstrated that supplemental release of sufentanil from the implant (as might occur with local heating) increases Cp an average of 2.5-2.8% per hours supplemental dose.; An implantable osmotic pump delivered sufentanil in vivo at the rate predicted from in vitro experiments. The rate at which sufentanil was absorbed from the subcutaneous space (half-life > 16 h) was markedly slower than reported with subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of large volumes of dilute opioids; this slow absorption dampens potential changes in Cp if release rate is perturbed.",6,E

Postoperative pain was measured during ambulation using a visual analogue pain score.; The study included 38 patients (18 TEA, 20 PCA), 16 of whom underwent right hemicolectomy or ileocolectomy and 22 sigmoid colectomy. Operating times, patient weight and distribution of American Society of Anesthesiologists grade were similar in the two groups. The mean(s.e.m.) total dose of drugs administered was 64(41) mg morphine in the PCA group, and 79(42) mg bupivacaine and 205(140) micro g fentanyl in the TEA group. Postoperative pain scores were significantly better in the TEA group at 6 h (mean(s.e.m.) 2.2(0.4) versus 6.6(0.5) with PCA; P = 0.001) and 18 h (2.2(0.3) versus 4.0(0.4); P = 0.003). Hospital stay was similar in the two groups.; TEA significantly improved early analgesia following laparoscopic colectomy but did not affect the length of hospital stay.",4,E

Recent evidence suggests that this sexual dimorphism may result from a naloxone-sensitive anti-analgesic effect that is activated along with, and summates with, the analgesic effect of these agents, resulting in decreased analgesia or increased pain. For example, nalbuphine (5 mg) produces profound anti-analgesia (i.e. enhanced pain) in men, but addition of a low dose of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (0.4 mg, opioid antagonist) induces significant analgesia in men and enhances nalbuphine analgesia in women. To further delineate the dose-dependent relationship of nalbuphine and naloxone, we recently evaluated the effect of a lower dose of nalbuphine (2.5 mg) with and without naloxone (0.4 mg) on dental postoperative pain. In women, nalbuphine alone induced modest short duration analgesia, which was antagonized by the addition of naloxone. In men, this dose of nalbuphine alone did not produce analgesia or anti-analgesia, and naloxone did not alter the response to nalbuphine. Thus, it appeared that the 2.5 mg dose of nalbuphine was not sufficient to induce anti-analgesia while the 0.4 mg dose of naloxone was able to antagonize the analgesic effect of nalbuphine, at least in women. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that an important determinant of naloxone enhancement of nalbuphine analgesia is the dose ratio of nalbuphine to naloxone. Since a dose ratio of 12.5:1 (i.e. 5 mg nalbuphine:0.4 mg naloxone) resulted in analgesic enhancement, but a dose ratio of 6.25:1 (2.5 mg:0.4 mg) did not, we tested the same, lower, dose of nalbuphine (2.5 mg) in combination with a lower dose of naloxone (0.2 mg) to maintain the 12.5:1 dose ratio. This lower dose of naloxone significantly prolonged the analgesic effect of nalbuphine in both men and women, suggesting that the anti-analgesic effect of nalbuphine is present in both sexes at the 2.5 mg dose and that the dose ratio of nalbuphine to naloxone is an important determinant of the analgesic efficacy of this combination.",6,E

In fact, pain was called the ""sixth vital sign"" by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) in 2001. The continued challenge of effective, safe analgesia in the outpatient setting has promoted the use of various devices designed to deliver local anesthetic directly to the surgical site. We endeavored to evaluate the efficacy of one such device currently in use.; Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study.; In this study, 49 consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Patients and investigators were blinded to group assignment. Group 1 (control group) received no catheter. Group 2 (placebo group) received an infusion catheter filled with saline. Group 3 (experimental group) received the same catheter filled with 0.25% bupivacaine solution. All patients received an ipsilateral femoral nerve block with 30 mL 0.25% bupivacaine and 20 mL 0.25% bupivacaine intra-articular injection. Patients recorded narcotic consumption and pain levels on visual analogue scales twice a day for 4 days after surgery. The catheters were removed on day 4 and physical therapy performance was recorded. The patients were then asked to continue to record pain ratings and medication consumption for an additional 4 days after catheter removal. All patients underwent bone-patellar tendon-bone ACL reconstruction by the senior author (P.D.F.). Seven patients were excluded from the study for ineffective femoral nerve block or catheter disconnection or occlusion. Narcotic consumption and the maximum, minimum, and median pain ratings were analyzed by analysis of variance.; Median pain ratings show lower pain levels (P <.03) for both catheter groups versus the control group. No significant differences were found between the catheter groups for the median pain ratings, but lower maximum pain ratings were seen in the bupivacaine group compared with both placebo and no-catheter control subjects. Postoperative narcotic consumption was also lower in both catheter groups versus control subjects (P <.03). Physical therapy data revealed no difference in range of motion on postoperative day 4. More patients were able to perform straight leg raises during the first therapy session in both the saline placebo catheter group (70%) and bupivacaine group (72%) compared with the control group (50%).; The data suggest some element of placebo benefit at median pain ratings but a protective effect of the bupivacaine at maximum pain levels.",3,E

Targeted drug delivery represents a significant advancement in the treatment of patients with chronic pain and is likely be the method of choice for the twenty-first century. This method of delivery is best represented by current drug delivery systems, such as the intrathecal drug pump.

The most common treatments used by this sample were massage (26.6%), opioids (22.5%) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (20%). The most effective treatments overall were 'physical therapies' with 50% receiving these treatments indicating that their pain was 'considerably reduced' or that they were 'pain free.' Opioids and anticonvulsants were perceived to be the most effective pharmacological agents prescribed (33.3 and 23.8% reporting their pain was considerably better or eliminated, respectively). People using prescription medication reported significantly greater pain severity, more widespread pain, more descriptive adjectives, more evoked pain, greater difficulty in dealing with pain, and more interference and decreased activity levels due to pain, compared to people not using prescription medication. A combination of greater difficulty in dealing with pain, intense pain, presence of evoked pain, and higher level of perceived support from significant others was predictive of taking prescription medication.; People taking prescription medication reported significantly more intense pain with neuropathic characteristics that significantly affected daily life and routine activities. A substantial percentage of individuals with pain related to SCI did not obtain significant pain relief from prescription medications.

Data collected included the patient's current pain level at the hernia site, pain medication currently used, narcotics currently used, return to normal work, and return to normal activity. Overall, 19.7 per cent of patients complained of mild pain, but only 2.2 per cent classified this as moderate or severe. Mild pain was noted more often in the open repair patients compared with the laparoscopic group. However, there was no difference in the frequency of moderate or severe pain. The time to return to work was longer in the open repair group than the laparoscopic repair group, but there were large ranges in both groups. The inability to return to full preoperative activity was infrequent and equivalent in both open and laparoscopic hernia repair groups. In our study of 229 patients undergoing elective open or laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair at a community hospital, we have found a low incidence of moderate or severe chronic pain.

After induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation, a lumbar epidural catheter was sited, a loading dose was administered (0.75 ml/kg levobupivacaine, 0.175%), and the epidural infusion was commenced. The primary endpoint was the need for rescue analgesia (morphine) in the first 10 h after surgery. Pain, motor strength, and side effects were recorded for 24 h. Venous blood was collected from 18 children to determine the plasma concentrations of levobupivacaine and/or fentanyl before and 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 26 or 30 h after the start of the epidural infusion.; Of the 114 children who were analyzed for intention to treat, a similar number of children in each group reached the 10-h mark. The time to the first dose of morphine in the first 10 h was less in the plain fentanyl group (P < 0.044). All other effects were similar among the four groups.

Specific patterns of activity may characterize hyperalgesic states and some chronic pain conditions. Forebrain nociceptive systems are under inhibitory control by endogenous opioids and can be affected by acute administration of mu-opioid receptor agonists. Anticipation of pain may in itself induce changes in brain nociceptive networks. Moreover, pain-related cortical activity can be modulated by hypnotic suggestions, focusing or diverting attention, and placebo. These findings begin to disclose the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain networks underlying pain perception and modulation.",3,E

At the time of their last MDS completion, residents in hospice were more likely to receive opioids for their moderate to severe pain than were non-hospice residents and residents enrolled in hospice after the last MDS assessments. However, hospice residents were twice as likely as non-hospice residents and 1.3 times as likely as residents who eventually enrolled in hospice to have pain documented. These counterintuitive findings suggest that there is differential documentation of pain on the MDS when hospice is involved in care, perhaps because of superior pain assessment by hospice.",3,E

This systematic review summarizes and assesses the evidence for the comparative efficacy and safety of long-acting opioids in the management of chronic non-cancer pain. Randomized trials (for comparative efficacy and adverse events) and observational studies (for adverse events only) that included non-parenteral long-acting opioids were sought using electronic databases, handsearching reference lists, and soliciting pharmaceutical company submissions. Searches were performed through October 2002. The validity of each included study was assessed using a data abstraction form and predefined criteria. An overall grade was allocated for the body of evidence for each key question. A total of 16 randomized trials (comparative efficacy and adverse events), enrolling 1427 patients, and 8 observational studies (adverse events) of 1190 patients were included in this review. No randomized trial was rated good quality; observational studies were generally of poorer quality than the trials. There was insufficient evidence to prove that different long-acting opioids are associated with different efficacy or safety profiles. There was also insufficient evidence to determine whether long-acting opioids as a class are more effective or safer than short-acting opioids. A subgroup of three studies on long-acting versus short-acting oxycodone was more homogeneous and provided fair evidence that these formulations are equally effective for pain control.",I,E

Notable advances include an increase in understanding pain during development and improvements in the management of acute pain. Although much more about the safe and effective management of pain in children is now known, this knowledge has not been widely or effectively translated into routine clinical practice. Lack of suitable research on which to firmly establish evidence-based care is likely to have contributed to this situation. A subject of considerable interest recently is the discovery that the experience of pain in early life may lead to long-term consequences. New research findings from laboratory and clinical studies have clearly identified possible mechanisms and provided evidence that long-term behavioral changes can extend far beyond what would be considered the normal period of postinjury recovery. Timing, degree of injury, and administered analgesia and its nature may be important determinants of the long-term outcome of infant pain. Chronic pain, including neuropathic pain, is far more common in children than was thought. The assessment and treatment of this pain and its functional consequences present a considerable unmet challenge. There is a pressing need for further research and clinical development in the management of pain in children.",4,E

The objective of this study was to further evaluate the pharmacokinetic effect of local heat administration on fentanyl drug delivery through the transdermal fentanyl patch delivery system in volunteers. In addition, the study was intended to document the effect of heat on steady-state transdermal fentanyl delivery. This was an open, 3-period, crossover study that evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of 25 microg/h transdermal fentanyl administered with and without local heat. During Sessions A and B, subjects received transdermal fentanyl for a 30-hour period. During Session A, heat was applied for 1 hour at the 24-hour time point during the 30-hour period. During Session B, heat was applied for the first 4 hours and then again for 1 hour at the 24-hour time point during the 30-hour period. The order of Sessions A and B was randomized, and a minimum of 2 weeks separated the sessions. Five of the 10 subjects returned to participate in Session C. During Session C, subjects received transdermal fentanyl 25 microg/h for 18 hours. Heat was applied during the first 4 hours of administration and then again for 15-minute periods at the 12- and 16-hour time points. Arterial blood samples for determination of serum fentanyl concentration were collected. Maximum concentration (C(max)), time to maximum concentration (t(max)), and area under the curve (AUC) were determined for each treatment period. Sedation, vital signs, oxygen saturation, and adverse events were recorded. During a period of 36 hours, there were no significant differences in C(max), AUC, or T(max) between transdermal fentanyl delivery with no heat and heat. However, significant differences were seen during the first 4 hours, with C(max) and AUC values almost 3 times higher for the heated administrations than for the administrations without heat. With heat, the mean C(max) was 0.63 ng/mL compared with a C(max) of 0.24 ng/mL without heat (P =.007). With early heat, the mean AUC was 1.22 ng/mL. h compared with 0.42 ng/mL. h without heat (P =.003). There was no statistically significant difference between the median times to achieve peak values (T(max)) during the first 4 hours. The addition of heat at 24 hours resulted in rapid increases in serum fentanyl concentrations for both groups and higher serum fentanyl concentrations for the administration that did not receive heat previously. Applying heat for 15 minutes at the 12-hour and 16-hour time points produced a rapid but short duration increase in serum fentanyl concentrations. The results suggest controlled heat might be used to significantly shorten the time needed to reach clinically important fentanyl concentrations. Controlled heat might be useful to produce rapid increases in serum concentrations for the rapid treatment of breakthrough pain.",6,E

Although many modalities exist for the treatment of this condition, few are as commonly used or as controversial as the use of opioids. Many sets of guidelines exist for the prescription of opioids for chronic nonmalignant pain, but little evidence addresses what factors actually contribute to the decision to initiate and maintain patients on these drugs. In these studies we first identified 2 groups of 100 patients each, all with chronic low back pain. Group N patients received long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy for the treatment of their pain, whereas Group O received opioids long-term. The identities of the specific analgesics were tabulated. A list of variables including patient characteristics, healthcare utilization factors, and psychologic characteristics were extracted from their medical records. Regression analysis was performed, which resulted in the identification of 4 variables of age, depression, personality disorder, and history of substance abuse as being closely linked to the use of opioids for the treatment of back pain in preference to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alone. By using the derived regression equation, 79% of patients could be correctly classified into Group O or Group N. Pain intensity did not predict opioid use.

For each side effect, we searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and identified 657 possible titles for inclusion. Of these, 67 studies met inclusion criteria for analysis. The lack of well-designed, randomized controlled trials and the heterogeneity of populations and study designs made the drawing of firm conclusions difficult and precluded performance of meta-analysis. The type, strength, and consistency of evidence for available interventions to manage opioid side effects vary from strong (eg, on the use of naloxone to reverse respiratory depression or constipation) to weak (eg, changing from the oral to epidural route of morphine administration to manage sedation).

14633551,Ketamine in chronic pain management: an evidence-based review.,Chronic Disease; Evidence-Based Medicine; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; Humans; Ketamine; Pain,"Hocking, Graham; Cousins, Michael J","Ketamine has diverse effects that may be of relevance to chronic pain including: N-methyl-D-aspartic acid, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, kainate, gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors; inhibition of voltage gated Na(+) and K(+) channels and serotonin, dopamine re-uptake. Ketamine has been in clinical practice for over 30 yr; however, there has been little formal research on the effectiveness of ketamine for chronic pain management. In this review we evaluate the available clinical data as a basis for defining the potential use of ketamine for chronic pain. Literature referenced in this review was obtained from a computer search of EMBASE and MEDLINE from 1966 through August, 2002. Search terms included ketamine, ketalar, pain, painful, analgesic, and analgesia. Abstracts were screened for relevance and publications relating to chronic pain use were obtained. Levels of evidence were stratified according to accepted guidelines (level I-IV). For central pain, there is level II and level IV evidence of efficacy for parenteral and oral ketamine. For complex regional pain syndromes, there is only level IV evidence of efficacy of epidural ketamine. For fibromyalgia, there is level II evidence of pain relief, reduced tenderness at trigger points, and increased endurance. For ischemic pain, a level II study reported a potent dose-dependent analgesic effect, but with a narrow therapeutic window. For nonspecific neuropathic pain, level II and level IV studies reported divergent results with questionable long-term effects on pain. For phantom limb pain and postherpetic neuralgia, level II and level II studies provided objective evidence of reduced hyperpathia and pain relief was usually substantial either after parenteral or oral ketamine. Acute on chronic episodes of severe neuropathic pain represented the most frequent use of ketamine as a ""third line analgesic,"" often by IV or subcutaneous infusion (level IV). In conclusion, the evidence for efficacy of ketamine for treatment of chronic pain is moderate to weak. However, in situations where standard analgesic options have failed ketamine is a reasonable ""third line"" option. Further controlled studies are needed.",3,E

However, the drug is no longer considered a first-line analgesic. Many clinicians recommend that meperidine be removed from health-systems or that its use be restricted, due to concerns about adverse reactions, drug interactions, and normeperidine neurotoxicity. In addition, clinical evidence shows that meperidine has no advantage over other opioids for biliary colic or pancreatitis. The formulary status of meperidine has been extensively discussed at University of Utah Hospitals and Clinics. The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee has been working with hospital staff to assess the impact of either removing meperidine from the formulary, or limiting its use.

14650359,Tramadol--the impact of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties on the clinical management of pain.,"Analgesics, Opioid; Drug Interactions; Humans; Pain; Tramadol","Klotz, Ulrich","Tramadol (CAS 36282-47-0) plays an important role in the management of pain. With its dual mechanism of action (opioid agonist; weak noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake inhibitor) tramadol provides a kind of combined/adjuvant pain therapy. Besides its proven clinical efficacy tramadol is a safe drug as respiratory depression, cardiovascular side effects, drug abuse and dependence are of minor clinical relevance, unlike some other opioids. Following oral administration the bioavailability of tramadol is high (70-90%) and with new slow release preparations twice daily administration enables effective pain control. Tramadol is characterised by low plasma protein binding (20%) and quite extensive tissue distribution (apparent volume of distribution about 3 l/kg). Elimination is primarily by the hepatic route (metabolism by CYP2D6 to an active metabolite and by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) and partly by the renal route (up to 30% of dose). Elimination half-lives of the active agents range between 4.5 and 9.5 h and total plasma clearance of tramadol is moderately high (600 ml/min). The interaction potential of tramadol is neglectable, as it does not affect the disposition of other drugs. It should be taken into account that inducers (e.g. carbamazepine) or inhibitors (e.g. quinidine for CY2D6) of drug metabolism might modify the elimination of tramadol. Likewise, if kidney (creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min) or hepatic function is severely impaired, some dosage reduction (approximately by 50%) or extension of the dosage interval should be considered. In conclusion, tramadol is an effective and safe analgesic with a very low interaction potential. Therefore it represents a drug of first choice if moderate to severe pain states have to be treated in pediatric, adult and elderly patients including those with poor cardiopulmonary function.",3,E

Chronic pain, inflammation and interleukin-1 beta enhance the production of substance P. Recently, axonal transport of opiate receptors was found to increase in rat sciatic nerves in the model of Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritis. Here we show that a single intraplantar injection of interleukin-1 beta is able to enhance the axonal transport of mu and kappa opiate receptors and substance P. Indeed, their accumulation was markedly increased in the proximal part of ligated sciatic nerves, but only in the paw injected with interleukin-1. The time course revealed a delayed onset and, more importantly, a long-term increase lasting at least six days, which is in contrast with the short-term pyrogenic effect of interleukin-1. Pretreatment of rats with capsaicin or administration of dexamethasone completely prevented the interleukin-1 beta effect. The present results suggest that interleukin-1 beta may serve as a mediator to sensitize nociceptors in chronic inflammation and possibly in hyperalgesia through long-term changes in neuronal plasticity.",E,E

Prior to this, their morphine dose had been optimised to provide the most favourable balance between pain relief and side effects. After 6 days of taking their optimised morphine dose at 4-hourly intervals, the patients were admitted to the Pain Management Unit such that the doses from 18:00 h on day 6 were taken under direct nursing supervision. Frequent blood samples were collected after the 10:00 h (dose 1), 14:00 h (dose 2) and 18:00 h (dose 3) on day 7. There was a significant difference between the 3 doses with respect to Cmax values for morphine with dose 3 > dose 1 > dose 2. Further, there was considerable variability in the percentage change of either dose 1 or dose 3 Cmax values relative to dose 2. The Cmax values of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), measured in 6 of the patients, for the 3 dosing intervals followed a similar trend to the parent drug, but only doses 1 and 2 differed significantly. Similar but less pronounced changes were observed in the area-under-curve parameter calculated for both morphine and M6G during the 3 dosing intervals. There were no significant differences in the Cmin or Tmax parameters for either morphine or M6G between the 3 dosing intervals. These results suggest intra-individual variation in the absorption of morphine or changes in the volume of distribution during the day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

Animal studies suggest intraspinal alpha 2-adrenergic agonists may be effective in such cases. Eighty-five patients with severe cancer pain despite large doses of opioids or with therapy-limiting side effects from opioids were randomized to receive, in a double-blind manner, 30 micrograms/h epidural clonidine or placebo for 14 days, together with rescue epidural morphine. Pain was assessed by visual analog score (VAS), McGill Pain Questionnaire, and daily epidural morphine use. Success was defined as a decrease in either morphine use of VAS pain, with the alternative variable either decreasing or remaining constant. Blood pressure, heart rate, and degree of nausea and sedation were monitored. Successful analgesia was more common with epidural clonidine (45%) than with placebo (21%). This was particularly prominent in those with neuropathic pain (56% vs. 5%). Pain scores were lower at the end of the treatment period in patients with neuropathic pain treated with clonidine rather than placebo, whereas morphine use was unaffected. Clonidine, but not placebo, decreased blood pressure and heart rate. Hypotension was considered a serious complication in 2 patients receiving clonidine and in 1 patient receiving placebo. This study confirms the findings from previous animal studies which showed the effective, potent analgesic properties of intraspinal alpha 2-adrenergic agonists and suggests that epidural clonidine may provide effective relief for intractable cancer pain, particular of the neuropathic type.",E,E

Tramadol's analgesic effect has been equated with that of pethidine, with a more favourable side-effect profile. Tramadol has been the most-selling prescription analgesic in Germany for several years, and it is now available in many other European countries, but still there is a lack of adequately controlled clinical studies of its analgesic properties. The purpose of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of 50 and 100 mg oral tramadol with our standard analgesic for postoperative pain treatment, 1000 mg paracetamol + 60 mg codeine, and placebo. A single-dose, parallel group, double-blind design was used. One hundred forty-four patients were enrolled the day after total hip replacement if they had a pain intensity of 60 mm or more on a 0-100 mm visual analogue scale. Treatments were compared on the basis of pain intensity and derived variables (pain intensity difference, and summed pain intensity differences), the need of rescue medication, and a global evaluation. Serum concentrations confirmed rapid and good absorption comparable with that reported in healthy volunteers. The active drug control, paracetamol+codeine, was significantly superior to placebo for all efficacy variable (P = 0.0002-0.004), confirming good assay sensitivity. Paracetamol+codeine was also significantly superior to both 50 mg tramadol (P = 0.002-0.03) and 100 mg tramadol (P = 0.002-0.02). There was no difference between placebo and 50 and 100 mg tramadol for any of the efficacy variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

PCA measures obtained during the first 24 h after surgery included: number of demands/h, number of completed deliveries/h, dose/h, and demand/delivery ratio. Visual analog scales of pain and anxiety were also obtained. Results indicated that pain relief was equivalent with minimal side effects for both opioids. The selection of opioid, however, influenced the pattern of PCA use, with an improved demand/delivery ratio initially for FEN.

Analgesic consumption, pain, general satisfaction, respiratory rate, and levels of SpO2 and tcCO2 (pulse oximetry and transcutaneous CO2 measuring) were evaluated. Recruitment was stopped after enrolment of 24 patients, on safety grounds. The Fentanyl group was more satisfied with postoperative pain relief (P = 0.008); they had a lower analgesic demand (P < 0.05) but also a lower respiratory rate (P < 0.05) and a higher level of tcCO2 23 hours after application (P < 0.05).

Some children required a rescue dose of morphine in the recovery room, including some who had received intravenous morphine at induction. Least supplementary morphine was required by those who had received paracetamol plus ketorolac. Postoperative nausea and vomiting was significantly less in the two groups which were not given intraoperative morphine. The number of vomiting incidents was also much less.

Pain sensations caused by advanced lithotriptors vary widely and have a significant impact on clinical management. We tested patient controlled analgesia during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and quantified analgesic requirements by means of patient controlled analgesia during ESWL of renal stones.; Patients with renal stone disease undergoing ESWL were randomized prospectively to receive an alfentanil infusion titrated by 4 different anesthesiologists not otherwise involved in the study (22 controls) or to self-administer alfentanil via a patient controlled infusion pump (22 patients). As a measure of individual pain sensitivity the detection, pain and tolerance thresholds of electrocutaneous sensitivity were determined in all patients.; Alfentanil was used more often in the patient controlled analgesia group than in the control patients (12 versus 8 required the narcotic, respectively, p = 0.226). Patients using patient controlled analgesia needed less drug (0.5 versus 2.15 mg., p = 0.005, median values), tolerated higher discharge voltages and pain intensities, needed significantly fewer shock waves to complete stone fragmentation (1,612 versus 2,105, p = 0.014) and had shorter treatment times (36.9 versus 46.2 minutes, p = 0.069). There was a significant correlation between the duration of shock wave exposure tolerated without analgesia, and pain (p = 0.0009) and tolerance (p = 0.0020) thresholds but not with regard to detection thresholds (p = 0.1400). Male patients showed significantly higher tolerance thresholds to electrocutaneous stimulation (10.2 versus 6.9 mA., p = 0.0238), which corresponded to longer analgesia-free treatment times in male versus female patients (31.7 versus 19.4 minutes, p = 0.0510).; Patient controlled analgesia increases pain tolerance, decreases narcotic requirements, simplifies ESWL as an outpatient procedure and can be used to quantify analgesic requirements during lithotripsy.

The APS was prioritized to elderly patient (36.1%, aged 65 or higher), patients of poor physical condition (27.0% ASA III or IV) and those undertaken major operations. Most patients (1348, 93.4%) received either one of the four standardized analgesic regimens including PCA or epidural analgesia.; The median verbal quantitative scale of pain (VQS) at rest/movement were 2.0/4.3 on operative day and 0/0.6 on 4th postoperative day. The morphine consumption in 665 Chinese patients (PCA intravenous morphine) was 26.1 +/- 14.3 mg/kg/h (mean +/- SD) during the first 20 postoperative hours. This decreased to 18.1 +/- 15.1 at 21th to 44th and 18.5 +/- 14.9 at 45th to 68th hours postoperatively. There was no difference in morphine consumption between Chinese patients and other races.

Groups of three patients were entered at escalating dose levels of Taxol in a traditional phase I design in each of two parallel arms: arm A, without G-CSF, and arm B, with G-CSF. Patients assigned to the G-CSF arm received G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg/d subcutaneously starting on day 2 for 9 to 14 days. All patients were pretreated with dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, and ranitidine, and were monitored continuously for cardiac arrhythmias during the first treatment.; Dose-limiting myelosuppression with Taxol without G-CSF was observed at the 250-mg/m2 dose level. The dose-limiting toxicity for Taxol with G-CSF was peripheral neuropathy at the 300-mg/m2 dose level. One of 35 patients (2.8%) had a grade 3 anaphylactic reaction at 250 mg/m2. No clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias were documented. Twenty-seven of 111 courses (24%) were associated with grade 3 arthralgias or myalgias requiring narcotics for pain control. Taxol plasma concentrations declined in a triexponential fashion, with a final elimination half-life of 10 to 12 hours. The peak Taxol plasma concentrations and total area under the curve (AUC) increased with increasing doses of Taxol, although this increase appeared to be somewhat nonlinear.; The maximum dose of Taxol recommended for phase II and III studies, when administered as a 3-hour infusion alone and with G-CSF support, is 210 mg/m2 and 250 mg/m2, respectively. No increased incidence of hypersensitivity reactions or other side effects were observed, with the possible exception of arthralgias and myalgias.

There is consensus among experts that most patients can be well-palliated using knowledge, medications, and techniques that are readily accessible. Despite this, only a small proportion of patients with cancer pain receive adequate analgesia. Some of the barriers that interfere with the delivery of appropriate analgesia are patient-related, while others involve health-care providers. Patients frequently do not communicate the intensity of their pain to care-givers and are often hesitant to take opiates. Health-care providers receive scant teaching on cancer pain, have little awareness of pain intensity in their patients, and may be overly concerned about opiate toxicities. They lack appropriate role models in academic institutions and may be concerned about the potential for investigation by law-enforcement agencies. These obstacles can be largely overcome by (a) emphasizing the importance of pain control in cancer patients, (b) considering the etiology of pain in each patient, (c) weighing the full range of available therapeutic options, (d) ensuring that ""user-friendly"" opiate-equivalence information is available, (e) using pain assessment tools routinely and recording pain intensity scores in the medical record, and by (f) not being easily dissuaded from providing adequate doses of opiates for pain relief.

This article reviews the results of single dose and short term studies of oral tramadol 50, 75, 100 and 150 mg in various acute pain conditions. In a double-blind single dose study conducted in 161 patients with severe pain following caesarean section, tramadol 75 and 150 mg and the combination of paracetamol 650 mg with dextropropoxyphene napsylate 100 mg were shown to be effective and statistically superior to placebo. The results from this and 17 other similar studies in patients with pain after surgery (n = 1594) or dental extraction (n = 1859) including other comparators were included in a pooled analysis. Tramadol 100 mg was the optimal single dose for acute pain and tramadol 50 mg showed similar analgesic efficacy to codeine 60 mg. Multiple dose short term studies (n = 520) with tramadol 50, 75 and 100 mg demonstrated a statistically significant and dose-dependent reduction in the consumption of either ibuprofen or morphine as escape medication. New pharmacokinetic data show that steady-state plasma tramadol concentrations reached after oral administration of 50 mg doses every 6 hours are similar to those obtained after administration of a 100 mg single oral dose (250 micrograms/L). This rationale is supported by the results of long term studies in which the average daily dose of tramadol was approximately 250 mg.",E,E

Incidence, causes and management of these form the major part of this article. Emergencies in palliative care also include sudden severe exacerbation of symptoms. Therefore, onset of severe pain, exacerbation of breathlessness, and worsening of other symptoms are also discussed with their appropriate treatment. A small armamentarium of appropriate medications is thus shown to cover treatment of the various emergencies that may arise. As palliative care deals with patients who are suffering from progressive fatal conditions, death is the expected end. Nevertheless, however well the family are prepared, death often appears for them as an emergency. Comment is made regarding this family emergency in the care of terminally ill people. Attention in this article is focussed on medical treatment. In the care of the emergency event, however, and in all palliative care, management includes making the patient comfortable, thinking of the needs of other patients and relatives observing the event, explaining what is happening and is being done, involving other members of the team, and communicating reassurance to the patient and the relatives as well as to other observers.",E,E

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of controlled release hydromorphone administered every 12 hours and immediate release hydromorphone administered every 4 hours in patients with chronic severe cancer pain.; Forty-eight patients with stable chronic severe cancer pain were randomized, in a double-masked crossover study, to controlled release hydromorphone every 12 hours or immediate release hydromorphone every 4 hours for 7 days each. Pain intensity was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) and the Present Pain Intensity Index of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Nausea and sedation were also assessed using a VAS. Assessments were made by the patient four times a day at 7:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., 3:00 p.m., and 7:00 p.m. Use of rescue hydromorphone also was recorded by the patient.; Forty-five patients completed the study (26 women, 19 men; mean age, 57.1 +/- 13.6 years) and received a mean daily dose of 76 +/- 133 mg (range, 6-768 mg). There were no significant differences between controlled release hydromorphone and immediate release hydromorphone in overall VAS pain intensity scores (19 +/- 14 vs. 20 +/- 14 mm), ordinal pain intensity scores (1.2 +/- 0.8 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.8) and pain scores by day of treatment or time of day. The daily rescue analgesic consumption during controlled release hydromorphone and immediate release hydromorphone did not differ significantly overall (1.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 1.0 +/- 1.1 doses per day) or with respect to time of day. There were no significant differences in overall VAS sedation scores (18 +/- 18 mm vs. 19 +/- 18 mm) and in overall mean VAS nausea scores (12 +/- 15 mm vs. 11 +/- 14 mm) between controlled release hydromorphone and immediate release hydromorphone.; Controlled release hydromorphone administered every 12 hours is as effective as immediate release hydromorphone administered every 4 hours in the management of patients with chronic severe cancer pain. The benefits of controlled release hydromorphone lie in the convenience of its capsule formulation, which can be sprinkled on soft food, and its 12-hour duration of action, which allows patients uninterrupted sleep and improved compliance.",E,E

At 21 points during the procedure, the haemodynamic variables of heart rate and systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures were recorded. The use of isoflurane was quantified; the number of patients requiring inhaled anaesthetic, concentration peaks, MAC minutes, and duration of isoflurane use were noted. The number of equal-volume supplemental opioid analgesic doses, postoperative analgesics, occurrence of postoperative nausea, emesis, and antiemetic doses were compared. The four groups exhibited similar patient demographics, total dose of muscle relaxants, types of surgical procedures, and duration of surgery or anaesthesia. Haemodynamic variables were stable with no difference among the four study groups. The patients given pentamorphone demonstrated both delayed requirement (P < 0.05) and shorter duration (P < 0.05) of isoflurane supplementation. Patients given either 5 micrograms.kg-1 or 7.5 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl needed isoflurane supplementation within 12 +/- 16 min and 12 +/- 17 min from induction respectively; while patients given either 0.75 micrograms.kg-1 or 1 microgram.kg-1 pentamorphone did not require isoflurane supplementation for 37 +/- 10 min and 43 +/- 26 min respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

Pamidronate disodium, a bisphosphonate, may prove helpful in the palliative treatment of bone metastases in patients with breast cancer as demonstrated in this multicenter, dose-ranging trial.; Ambulatory female patients age 18 years or older with breast cancer metastatic to bone and a life expectancy of at least 3 months were eligible for the study. Bone metastases were confirmed by bone scan or bone survey within 6 months of enrollment. Sixty-one patients were treated as outpatients and were randomized to receive one of four intravenous pamidronate regimens for 12 weeks: 30 mg administered every 2 weeks, 60 mg every 4 weeks, 60 mg every 2 weeks, or 90 mg every 4 weeks. The primary efficacy parameter for this study was pain score. The change from baseline in pain score was determined for each patient at each study visit and at endpoint, defined as the last postbaseline evaluation for each patient before or at week 12. Secondary efficacy variables included narcotic scores, urinary calcium/creatinine and hydroxyproline/creatinine ratios, serum osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatase concentrations, and bone lesion (radiologic) response.; At 3 months, the regimens of 60 mg every 4 weeks, 60 mg every 2 weeks, and 90 mg every 4 weeks resulted in significant reduction in bone pain beginning by week 6 of treatment. The regimen of 30 mg every 2 weeks was not effective. Narcotic use, as reflected by narcotic scores, did not parallel the pain scores, because there was little evidence of any effect for any of the treatment groups. Reduction in bone pain was accompanied by decreases in urinary calcium/creatinine and hydroxyproline/creatinine ratios, and bone alkaline phosphatase concentrations. Side effects of pamidronate were mild and transient. Radiographic changes consistent with healing of lytic lesions were observed in 15 patients (25%).; Intravenous pamidronate is a well tolerated treatment that produced significant relief of bone pain in the majority of patients with metastatic breast cancer at the three highest doses tested.",E,E

Because a number of factors are implicated in the pathophysiology of bone pain, a multidisciplinary approach in its assessment and treatment is often required. Treatment often includes the use of analgesic drug therapy; however, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery may also be needed.; The use of systemic radionuclide therapy may often be helpful to relieve bone pain and improve the quality of life. In the setting of diffuse bone metastasis, intractable to conventional therapy, various radioisotopes have been advocated. These include phosphorous-32, iodine-131, strontium-89, yttrium-90, samarium-153, and rhenium-186, often as either the anionic phosphate or as a ligand (HEDP, EDTMP).; When these agents are used, pain relief often occurs in approximately 2-4 weeks and lasts several weeks to months with responses seen in 60-80% of patients, depending on the extent of disease and stage the patient is treated. Retreatment has been possible in certain cases with further palliation being offered and improvement in the various quality of life parameters being noted.; Myelotoxicity has been a limiting factor with certain isotopes and has led to the development of less toxic bone seeking agents. Although these each have unique physical and biokinetic properties requiring different doses and protocols for administration, they all appear to localize in osteoblastic metastatic sites in sufficient amounts to provide bone pain palliation.",E,E

As such, patients with back pain require careful assessment to determine whether the cause is from the spine or other systems. For acute mechanical back pain, treatment is often symptomatic. Symptomatic treatment may include analgesics, anti-inflammatories and/or muscle relaxants. Patients may also need hypnotics in the short term to help them sleep at night. However, drug therapy should be reduced and stopped as soon as possible. Furthermore, too much bedrest may be counterproductive. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the standard treatment for transient back pain. More severe pain may require the addition of an opioid, such as codeine or dextropropoxyphene. Morphine and pethidine (meperidine) may be necessary in patients with back pain due to neoplastic disease or osteoporotic fracture. However, the opioid analgesics are associated with dependence, tolerance and adverse effects. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have analgesic efficacy comparable with paracetamol. Individual patients respond differently to different NSAIDs, and several agents may have to be tried. Long term therapy with NSAIDs is necessary in diseases with an inflammatory component such as ankylosing spondylitis. Calcitonin reduces bone resorption and bone blood flow, and has been suggested to have central analgesic effects. As such, it has been used successfully in patients with Paget's disease, osteolytic bone disease and osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates also inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption and may be useful in Paget's disease, osteolytic metastases and osteoporotic fractures. Other drugs which may be useful in relieving back pain associated with specific circumstances include the tricyclic antidepressants, anxiolytics, antiepileptic agents, corticosteroids, colchicine and chymopapain.",3,E

In twelve patients the pain was due to cancer and three patients had pain of non malignant origin. All of the patients reported excellent or good relief. A total of 14 complications were reported in 7 patients. Most of these were minor and related to surgical or mechanical problems. One patient with pain of non malignant origin developed serious complications which required the removal of the infusion device. The results of this study show that chronic intrathecal infusion of morphine is superior to conventional forms of analgesia in patients with intractable pain of malignant origin. We would advise that it should remain a therapy of last resort in patients with intractable non malignant pain as the long term side effects are still unknown and the potential for serious side effects still exists.,E,E
7535139,Surgical management of cancer pain.,Brain; Electric Stimulation; Humans; Narcotics; Neoplasms; Pain Management; Palliative Care; Stereotaxic Techniques,"Hassenbusch, S J","Although the technology has improved rapidly and provided many different techniques, information is lacking concerning the application of the technology. These techniques are applied, for the most part, only to patients with severe pain, because many of the nonsurgical options adequately manage pain that is minimal or mild in severity. Decisions for selection of a specific technique can be based on expected survival time, need for focal or diffuse pain control, or preference for ablative or augmentative options. For patients with good prognosis, augmentative techniques or simple ablative techniques are used more frequently, whereas ablative procedures with higher risk or destruction of more tissue are used later. Patients with severe pain and a poor prognosis represent the most difficult treatment group for three reasons: (1) the severity of the pain and the tendency of the pain to worsen significantly during the patient's remaining time, (2) the limited expected survival time of the patient, which some-what limits the use of an expensive, complicated intervention or operation, and (3) the considerable controversy that has been generated by the large number of different treatment options for this group. Because of these issues, there is not a general consensus concerning a treatment algorithm for this group of patients. This emphasizes the need for controlled, comparative studies of systemic treatments and interventional treatments as well as side-by-side comparisons of the efficacy and complications of the different types of surgical techniques. In light of the recently released cancer pain guidelines from the United States Agency for Health Care Policy Research, one would hope that the research of the next 5 years would focus on providing many of the answers to these problems.",E,E

The duration of epidural or subarachnoid infusions in three patients ranged from 3 to 9 days, and minimal complications occurred. The duration of sedation ranged from 1 to 15 days. Maximal intravenous opioid dosing ranged from 3.8 to 518 mg/kg per hour of morphine equivalent. The maximal infusion rate (exceeding all previous published reports) occurred in an infant with an isolated metastasis in the periaqueductal gray matter, a brain-stem site linked to mediating analgesia and defense reactions. The need for massive opioid dosing in 11 of 12 patients was associated with tumor spread to the spinal nerve roots, nerve plexus, large peripheral nerve, or spinal cord compression.; Standard dosing of opioids adequately treats most cancer pain in children; however, a significant group requires more extensive management. These problems occur more commonly among patients with solid tumors metastatic to spine and major nerves.",E,E

The steady-state molar ratio of H3G to hydromorphone was 27:1.

Pain-generating mechanisms in burns include nociception, primary and secondary hyperalgesia and neuropathy. The clinical studies of burn pain characteristics reveal very clear-cut differences between continuous pain and pain due to therapeutic procedures which have to be treated separately. Some of the main features of burn pain are: (1) its long-lasting course, often exceeding healing time, (2) the repetition of highly nociceptive procedures which can lead to severe psychological disturbances if pain control is inappropriate. Pharmaco-therapy with opioids is the mainstay for analgesia in burned patients, but non-pharmacological techniques may be useful adjuncts. Routine pain evaluation is mandatory for efficient and safe analgesia. Special attention must be given to pain in burned children which remains too often underestimated and undertreated. More educational efforts from physicians and nursing staff are necessary to improve pain management in burned patients.",E,E

When administered at a 2.5:1 analgesic ratio, MS-CRS given every 12 hours showed an equivalent extent of absorption compared with subcutaneous morphine given every 4 hours (AUC0-12, 132.5 +/- 30.1 versus 123.8 +/- 27.3 ng.h.mL-1, P = not significant [NS]). Peak morphine concentrations were lower, time of peak was later, and percent fluctuation less after MS-CRS than after subcutaneous morphine (Cmax, 14.7 +/- 2.9 versus 29.9 +/- 5.4 ng/mL, P = .0110; tmax, 3.33 +/- 0.75 versus 2.22 +/- 0.15 hours, P = .0160; fluctuation, 122 +/- 71 versus 356 +/- 123%, P = .00160). Relative bioavailability of MS-CRS using the 2.5:1 analgesic ratio was 105%, and bioavailability from data dose normalized without regard to route specificity in metabolism was 42%. For both routes of administration there was a significant linear relationship between morphine dose and AUC (MS-CRS, r = .8568, P = .0032; subcutaneous morphine, r = .8314, P = .0055). MS-CRS morphine provides a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with dosing every 12 hours; at steady state, the extent of absorption is comparable with that of subcutaneous morphine when administered at a 2.5:1 dose ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

A workup and treatment guide for the primary care physician.,Algorithms; Chronic Disease; Humans; Male; Pain; Pain Management; Testis,"Baum, N; Defidio, L","Chronic pain syndromes are encountered in every medical practice, and workup can be costly and frustrating. Patients with chronic testicular pain were once referred early to urologists but are now being seen and successfully treated in primary care offices. Referral is usually reserved for diagnosis of questionable testicular masses and for surgery. Antibiotic therapy, often combined with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, may be useful--in some cases even when infection has not been identified. Spermatic cord block and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may help relieve pain, although it often recurs. Antidepressants sometimes relieve pain and alleviate the psychogenic symptoms that may accompany it. Many patients benefit from a program at a multidisciplinary pain-management clinic and should complete one before opiate therapy is prescribed. When all conservative efforts have failed and testicular pain continues to diminish the patient's quality of life, orchiectomy may have to be considered. In general, however, we recommend that surgery be undertaken only when a pathologic condition is found and not for pain relief alone.",E,E

The bupivacaine group had lower pain score than the control group during the first 4 hours (p < 0.001 at 1 hour and p < 0.05 at 2 hours). At 4 hours, it showed similar analgesic efficacy as morphine. There was no significant analgesic effect at the end of the study period. The combination of the two drugs resulted in satisfactory analgesia throughout the entire study period (p < 0.001 at 1, 2 and 24 hours and p < 0.05 at 4 hours) and appeared to be a simple, safe and effective analgesic technique for patients who underwent therapeutic arthroscopic knee surgery.",E,E

It was the aim of this paper to report the presence of a rarely documented side effect.; In our experience, 135 patients were treated with vinorelbine during the period 10/92 to 11/94 for a total of 1080 cycles. In 26% of the cycles, vinorelbine was administered in monochemotherapy and in 74% in polychemotherapy regimens. The dose of vinorelbine, administered in a weekly schedule, was 25 mg/m2 in 109 patients and 30 mg/m2 in 26 patients. In general, no analgesic premedication was used. Sixty-five patients had lung cancer, 45 had breast cancer, and 25 miscellaneous cancer. Only 4 patients had a previous history of neurotoxicity.; Ten patients (7%) had pain in the tumor site within a few minutes of the vinorelbine injection. According to WHO grade, 5 cases had moderate and 5 severe pain. Pain was always reversible. In 5 cases ketorolac was administered after pain detection with resolution of the symptoms; in 4 cases it was necessary to deliver buprenorphine. One patient was admitted to the coronary unit because a myocardial infarction was suspected after retrosternal pain and required i.v. morphine. Seven cases refused to continue the treatment, and 3 cases had no further problem after ketorolac premedication.; Although rare, the presence of severe pain after vinorelbine injection may adversely affect the treatment course.

Forty ASA I-II patients scheduled for arthroscopy of the knee received premedication with 0.4 mg buprenorphine (group B) and 42 patients were given placebo (group P). Postoperatively, pethidine was given to patients with pain. Three of the 40 patients in group B vs 11 of the 42 in group P received pethidine (P < 0.05). In group B, however, 13 of the 40 patients complained of nausea, prolonging median time to discharge from 155 to 255 minutes (P < 0.05). In group P, 3 of the 42 patients were nauseated, P < 0.01, compared with group B. Time to discharge did not differ between the groups in patients without nausea. The median respiratory rate was significantly lower in group B, but no patient required ventilatory support. In conclusion, premedication with sublingual buprenorphine cannot be recommended for this procedure. It reduces the need for postoperative injections of pethidine but increases the incidence of postoperative nausea which prolongs the recovery time. Careful monitoring is also mandatory because of the possibility of respiratory depression.",E,E

Sixty patients were allocated randomly to receive intra-articular injections of pethidine 50 mg, morphine 5 mg or saline after elective arthroscopic meniscectomy. Postoperative pain was assessed using an interval visual analogue scale and measuring analgesic requirements.

However, there are little data from which to select a rational dose of bupivacaine. The study examined the effects of increasing amounts of epidural bupivacaine on postoperative analgesia, epidural fentanyl consumption, and side effects after thoracotomy.; Twenty-four patients were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive intra- and postoperative epidural infusions of either saline, 0.01% bupivacaine, 0.05% bupivacaine, or 0.1% bupivacaine at 10 mL/h. All patients received a standardized combined epidural (120 mg lidocaine and 1.5 micrograms/kg of fentanyl) and general anesthesia. Further postoperative analgesia was provided with fentanyl patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) only.; There were no differences between groups in visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores at rest or cough, but 10 and 5 mg/h of bupivacaine provided better analgesia during physiotherapy (P < .05). The use of 10 and 5 mg/h of bupivacaine led to significant opioid sparing (50% decrease) when compared to saline and 1 mg/h bupivacaine (P < .03). There was a trend toward a greater incidence of orthostasis with the use of bupivacaine at 10 mg/h (P = .09). Incidences of opioid side effects were not different between groups.; The results demonstrate improved analgesia with physiotherapy and significant opioid sparing when 10 and 5 mg/h doses of bupivacaine are used. However, the incidence of orthostasis may be increased with the use of 10 mg/h. Thus, 5 mg/h of epidural bupivacaine (.05% at 10 mL/h) improved analgesia, decreased opioid requirements, and did not have detectable hemodynamic effects.",E,E

The introduction of a transnasal formulation of butorphanol represents a new and noninvasive presentation of an analgesic for moderate to severe pain. This route of administration bypasses the gastrointestinal tract, and this is an advantage for a drug such as butorphanol that undergoes significant first-pass metabolism after oral administration. The onset of action and systemic bioavailability of butorphanol following transnasal delivery are similar to those after parenteral administration. The analgesic efficacy of transnasal butorphanol was generally superior to that of placebo in clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain or migraine headache. Results from single trials indicate that transnasal butorphanol provides pain relief comparable to that of intramuscular pethidine (meperidine) in postsurgical pain and comparable to or greater than intramuscular methadone in migraine headache. Moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain also appears to be responsive to transnasal butorphanol on the basis of results from 1 small noncomparative study. Tolerability of transnasal butorphanol parallels that of the injectable form, with somnolence, dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting reported most frequently. Thus, transnasal butorphanol is a novel formulation of an established analgesic which appears suitable for the short term treatment of moderate to severe pain, especially in an ambulatory setting. Transnasal butorphanol is likely to provide an alternative to oral opioid analgesics, particularly in the presence of nausea or vomiting, or to parenteral opioids when the oral route of administration is not appropriate.",E,E

These changes are also thought to be the underlying cause of much chronic pain. Central sensitisation is generated not only during surgery, but also postoperatively as a result of the inflammatory response to the damaged tissue. This knowledge provides a rational basis for pro-active, pre-emptive and postoperative analgesic strategies to reduce the neuronal barrage associated with tissue damage. Reduction or elimination of postoperative pain is therefore possible. We advocate the use of continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve block for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing thoracotomy. When this is begun pre-emptively (by precutaneous, pre-incisional paravertebral block) it is combined with an opiate and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug premedication. In a randomised study of 56 patients, pain scores of less than 0.5 cm on a 10 cm scale were produced, postoperative lung function was preserved and glucose and cortisol responses were significantly unchanged from preoperative values. Evidence that effective perioperative analgesia reduces the incidence of chronic post-thoracotomy chest wall pain was found in a retrospective study of 1000 consecutive thoracotomies. The endpoints of a zero pain score, complete preservation of preoperative lung function and prevention of the stress response to trauma are currently achievable and should be provided for virtually all patients undergoing chest surgery.

Seventy to eighty per cent of these patients will experience moderate or severe pain at some stage of their illness and at present most of these will die in pain. This is true in spite of the fact that there is substantial evidence which shows that in as many as 80% of patients with cancer pain it is possible to obtain complete relief with orally administered analgesics, either alone or supplemented with co-analgesic (adjuvant) drugs. Management is based on the three-step analgesic ladder whereby the choice of analgesic (non-opioid, weak opioid, or strong opioid) is determined by the severity of pain. The main reasons for failure to achieve control of pain are inexperience and lack of knowledge of the simple principles of effective analgesic use, and in many countries the non-availability of strong opioid analgesics. The most important advances in management have been the simplification and refinement of analgesic treatment which have made relief of cancer pain more widely accessible to patients. The introduction of controlled-release oral formulations of morphine has had a considerable impact because they are convenient and simple to use. The recent development of a long-acting non-invasive transdermal delivery system for strong opioid administration promises a further step forward in terms of flexibility and convenience for cancer patients.",E,E

Pain relief was established with intravenous (i.v.) fentanyl. A transdermal system was selected to deliver the same hourly dose while the i.v. infusion was tapered over 6 h. The transdermal system was changed every 24 h for a total duration of 3-156 days. A larger multicentre outpatient trial was conducted in 39 patients for a median of 84 days (range 5-365). The TTS fentanyl dose was established from a conversion table based on the dose of oral immediate-release morphine required to control pain. The TTS fentanyl patches were changed every 72 h. Immediate-release morphine was used on an as required basis for incident pain. The initial study demonstrated that steady-state plasma levels were linearly related to the TTS fentanyl dose. The multicentre trial further demonstrated that patients could be converted from oral morphine to an equianalgesic dose of TTS fentanyl and that pain relief could be maintained for a lengthy period of time on an outpatient basis. The systems were used throughout a variety of concomitant complications of the cancer process. This experience demonstrated the safety and clinical effectiveness of TTS fentanyl in the treatment of chronic cancer pain.

Patients receiving this treatment should first be titrated to stable pain relief with oral opioids and should have recourse during therapy to fast-acting, short-duration analgesics for the control of incident pain. TTS fentanyl dosing schedules should be based upon the patient's requirement for rescue dosing and duration of effective pain control. The average requirement to change fentanyl patches is every 72 h, although 48-h dosing is necessary in a few patients. This novel route of fentanyl administration allows convenient outpatient treatment, the possibility of a lower incidence of side effects, and may thus aid compliance.",E,E

Recently, intrathecal morphine therapy has been used with some success in such patients.; The clinical course of two patients with intractable reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is described. Both patients developed intractable leg pain, swelling and autonomic changes after a leg injury. Numerous medical treatments and surgical sympathectomies failed to provide long term relief.; Relatively satisfactory symptom control was achieved only with the use of long term intrathecal morphine therapy delivered by subcutaneously implanted infusion pumps. Exacerbations of the RSD continued to occur, at times in association with further leg trauma, but these could be controlled by a temporary escalation of the intrathecal morphine dose. Complications of morphine therapy were relatively minor. A red rash appearing over the pump site was the first sign that a drug catheter break had occurred, necessitating surgical catheter revision.; Long term intrathecal morphine therapy is a useful treatment option for patients with intractable severe RSD who have failed other therapies and remain markedly disabled.",E,E

The purpose of this randomized prospective trial was to measure the difference in pulmonary function in nonintubated patients with unilateral multiple rib fractures receiving two modalities of pain relief: systemic narcotic medications alone or local anesthetics given by intrapleural catheter (IPCs). Forty-two patients were randomized to receive systemic narcotic medications or IPCs for pain control. The patients with IPCs statistically had more compromised pulmonary function as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC) on admission; however, they tended toward a greater objective improvement of FVC on discharge. When analyzing a cohort of severely impaired patients (initial FVC < 20%), half of the systemic medication patients compared to only 10% of the IPC group failed and required another mode of therapy. Catheter complications were minor and did not contribute to overall morbidity. The IPC patients had fewer failures than the systemic medication patients.",E,E

Children were randomized to receive intramuscular (i.m.) ketorolac (1 mg/kg, EXP group, n = 45) or saline (CTL group, n = 42) at the completion of surgery. Intravenous (i.v.) fentanyl (0.5 micrograms/kg/dose) was administered in repeated doses postoperatively. Pain intensity was measured using both the Oucher and the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) to allow for comparison between self-report and behavioral measures of pain intensity. Severity of postoperative bleeding was measured using a 4-point rating scale. The EXP group had a significant reduction in total fentanyl dose (mean: 35.9 micrograms) compared to the CTL group (mean: 48.3 micrograms, t = -2.21, P < 0.03). There was a statistically significant decrease in pre-fentanyl CHEOPS scores in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) in the ketorolac group (F (2, 30) = 5.34, P < 0.01), but not in the saline group (F (2.24) = 2.46, P > 0.05). In the first hour postoperatively, the CHEOPS demonstrated significant decreases in pain intensity scores in response to opioids, in both groups. In the PACU, children were unable to provide a self-report of pain intensity potentially due to a variety of factors (e.g., emergence delirium, agitation, excitement, sedation, and/or pain). However, during the remainder of the postoperative stay, the photographic scale of the Oucher was a more valid measure of pain intensity than the CHEOPS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

They are also important in the management of psychosomatic illnesses, chronic pain syndromes, and specific chronic illnesses. In this era of preoccupation with the cost of health care, there is no consensus about the clinical necessity and cost effectiveness of pediatric hospital psychosocial care programs. The validity of psychosocial care as a clinically effective and cost-effective approach to pediatric care, however, can be established only from carefully controlled, well-designed scientific studies. Optimally, these studies should be randomized, prospective, controlled trials that include the reliable identification of specific psychosocial problems and the subsequent validation of treatment approaches.

Other mechanisms of late toxicity of opioids may be found at the receptor level. Whatever the cause, a change of opioids using equianalgesic doses can be expected to improve symptoms of toxicity in some patients, while maintaining pain control. We reviewed the experience with this technique in patients admitted to the Palliative Care Unit of the Edmonton General Hospital. Of 191 patients, 80 underwent opioid rotation (OR) for cognitive failure, hallucinations, myoclonus, nausea and vomiting, local toxicity, and persistent pain. These leading symptoms improved in 58/80 patients (73%, P < 0.01). Pain control, as measured on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS), improved from 4.4 +/- 2.3 to 3.6 +/- 2.0 (P < 0.004) at a dose significantly lower than that predicted to be equianalgesic (577 +/- 1535 mg before OR versus 336 +/- 593 mg after OR, P < 0.04).

Previous review articles were scrutinized for additional citations, and manufacturers provided a contemporary bibliography of more recent material.; Studies were selected for specific citation on the basis of comparative research merit and the contribution of this original literature to the pharmacologic profile(s) described.; All SSRIs appear to be more efficacious than placebo for the acute treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Short-term (six-week) efficacy was comparable with that of tricyclic antidepressants for the amelioration of MDD regarded as moderate in severity. Further comparative trials are clearly indicated to demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of SSRIs in specific populations (e.g., geriatric, severely ill) and to demonstrate sustained benefit with long-term prophylaxis. Other potential indications for SSRIs include obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, bulimia, and chronic pain syndromes. Pharmacokinetic profiles of the four SSRIs reveal similar parametric values, and most quantitative differences are of limited clinical significance. Adverse effects are common but ordinarily mild and transient, primarily restricted to the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. Important differences in the prevalence or severity of these adverse effects await the accumulation of further clinical experience and the completion of additional comparative trials. Similarly, the relative propensity of SSRIs to inhibit the metabolism of other medications is currently under investigation.; The four SSRIs studied appear to be more similar than they are different. Slowly, important distinctions are beginning to emerge with regard to adverse effect profiles and potential drug interactions. Given that the costs of these respective medications are comparable, such differences may ultimately serve to establish the preferential selection of individual agents in specific clinical situations.",E,E

Thus, 12 (52%) of the 23 patients achieved 50% or greater reduction in pain intensity. Although changes in the patterns of analgesic medication usage were few, six patients (26%) now experience a normal life style. Only one complication was seen, namely a dislocated electrode, which was easily replaced. Chronic electrical stimulation of the trigeminal nerve root appears to be an easy and safe technique for providing relief of chronic facial pain related to injury to the trigeminal nerve in a significant number of patients.",E,E

A 104-item measure of pain coping responses and 3 measures of functioning were completed by 176 chronic pain patients. Two-week retest data were provided by 111 of these patients. Item and scale analyses resulted in a 65-item measure that assessed 11 pain coping dimensions. This inventory was then cross-validated in a second sample of chronic pain patients (n = 78), who also completed a measure of pain-related distress. The significant others (typically, spouses) of patients in the second sample rated patients on a significant-other version of the CPCI and on other measures of patient functioning. The results support the reliability of the CPCI scales. Four scales (Guarding, Resting, Asking for Assistance, and Task Persistence) predicted patient- and significant other-reported patient adjustment. Eight scales (Guarding, Opioid Medication Use, NSAID Use, Sedative-Hypnotic Medication Use, Resting, Asking for Assistance, and Exercise/Stretch) demonstrated moderate-to-strong relationships between patient and significant-other versions, further supporting their validity.",E,E

Clinical pain states with allodynia in connection with longstanding superficial wounds have, however, not been reported in the literature. In this case a chronic pain state developed in a previously healthy 17-year-old girl in and around a persistently suppurating appendectomy wound. There was no spontaneous pain but pronounced allodynia in the wound and in the surrounding skin. Quantitative thermal tests showed abnormal thresholds for several sensory modalities confirming abnormal processing of sensory input from the involved area. The pattern of sensory abnormalities evaluated with thermal testing changed transiently and the allodynia diminished during a phentolamine block. Since the pain responded poorly to opioids and ketamine has been reported to reduce allodynia, it was administered in a sub-dissociative bolus dose during wound dressing. The wound was essentially unchanged after treatment for 3 months but the allodynia and sensory aberrations had decreased significantly. We interpret these results as a de-sensitizing effect in the long term of repeated NMDA-receptor blockade by ketamine in a chronic pain state, with indications of central sensitization, partially maintained by sympathetic activity.",E,E

It is important to be vigilant regarding side effects, including abuse. The treatment of chronic pain can be frustrating and confusing because most patients with pain experience remissions and relapses. The initial report of reduced pain by the patient to any of the treatments that have been attempted may lead to false optimism about the nature of the condition or the potential long-term response to medication. With time the patient may report a reduced response to the medication and suggest either a higher dose or a different medication. In such patients it is important to reexamine the original differential diagnosis. When in doubt, additional consultation with pain centers, other clinicians with experience in managing patients with chronic pain, and consultation with the patient's physician may be needed. If the patient develops an abnormal personality or behavioral profile, referral to a specialist in behavioral medicine may also be needed. The treatment of chronic benign pain should proceed as planned, being careful not to place the patient in an ""at-risk position"" regarding medications and their effects or side effects.",E,E

Studies have shown that the natural course of acute radiculopathy has a good prognosis. Bed rest, information, and analgesics usually are sufficient therapeutic measures. Prolongation of symptoms requires radiologic examination. The decision regarding continued conservative therapy versus surgical intervention must be evaluated.

Vision and other sensory functions began to improve within 2 months of vitamin therapy, and normal vision eventually was restored.; The relatively prompt improvement and the eventual complete recovery of vision following vitamin replacement therapy suggest that the subnormal level of vitamin B12 precipitated visual loss. Given the clinical similarities of subnormal vitamin B12, LHON, and nutritional/tobacco amblyopia, deficiency of adenosine triphosphate might be a unifying etiology for several types of optic neuropathy.

Patients were evaluated before their first operation for PC or first treatment with chemotherapy at a large tertiary-care cancer center.; One hundred thirty patients with proven PC were studied: 83 before their operation and 47 before their first chemotherapy treatment. At the time of study entrance, 37% of patients had no pain and an additional 34% had pain that was mild or less severe. Only 29% of patients had moderate, strong, or severe pain. Chemotherapy patients reported significantly more intense pain than did preoperative patients (P = .02). Symptoms of depression were assessed using the BDI and BHS scales. A substantial minority of patients (38%) had BDI scores > or = 15, which suggests high levels of depressive symptoms. There was a significant correlation between increasing pain and depressive symptoms among those who experienced pain. Quality of life was assessed using the Weekly Activity Checklist (WAC) and the FLIC. Compared with patients who had no pain or mild pain, patients with moderate or greater pain had significantly impaired functional activity (P = .03) and poorer quality-of-life scores (P = .02) when compared with those with lesser degrees of pain. There were significant correlations between increasing pain and depression and between pain and depressive symptoms and impaired quality of life and function.; Our results indicate that moderate or severe pain and symptoms of depression are not as prevalent in recently diagnosed PC patients as is generally believed. However, one third have inadequate pain control despite the use of oral analgesics. These patients can be identified by the use of a simple self-report instrument (the MPAC card). Quality of life and function are adversely affected by moderate or greater levels of perceived pain intensity. A simple and rapid assessment is possible and can identify high-risk patients in need of intervention that may improve quality of life.",E,E

Vomiting and restlessness following ENT and eye surgery are undesirable, and may be related to the emetic and analgesic effects of any analgesic given to augment anaesthesia during surgery. 2. To rationalise the choice of analgesic for routine ENT surgery we examined the intraoperative, recovery and postoperative effects following the administration of either buprenorphine (3.0 to 4.5 micrograms kg-1), diclofenac (1 mg kg-1), fentanyl (1.5 to 2.0 micrograms kg-1), morphine (0.1 to 0.15 mg kg-1), nalbuphine (0.1 to 0.15 mg kg-1), pethidine (1.0 to 1.5 mg kg-1) or saline (as control) given with the induction of anaesthesia in 374 patients. A standardised anaesthetic technique with controlled ventilation using 0.6-0.8% isoflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen was employed. The study population constituted 7 similar groups of patients. 3. Intraoperatively, their effects on heart rate and blood pressure, airway pressure and intraocular pressure, were similar. This implies, most surprisingly, that neither their analgesic nor their histamine releasing effects were clinically evident during surgery. By prolonging the time to extubation at the end of anaesthesia, only buprenorphine, fentanyl, morphine and pethidine provided evidence of intraoperative respiratory depression. 4. Postoperatively, buprenorphine was associated with severe respiratory depression, prolonged somnolence, profound analgesia and the highest emesis rate. Diclofenac exhibited no sedative, analgesic, analgesic sparing, emetic or antipyretic effects. Fentanyl provided no sedative or analgesic effects, but was mildly emetic. Morphine provided poor sedation and analgesia, delayed the requirement for re-medication and was highly emetic. Nalbuphine and pethidine produced sedation with analgesia during recovery, a prolonged time to re-medication and a mild emetic effect. None provided evidence, from analysis of postoperative re-medication times and analgesic consumption, of any pre-emptive analgesic effect. 5. We conclude that nalbuphine (mean dose 0.13 mg kg-1) and pethidine (mean dose 1.35 mg kg-1), given individually as a single i.v. bolus during induction of anaesthesia, are the most efficacious analgesics for routine in-patient ENT surgery.",E,E

The primary purpose of this study was to examine physicians' beliefs about and prescribing of the long-term use of opioids in the treatment of chronic pain patients. Concerns about regulatory pressure and appropriateness of education regarding opioids were also examined. The design was a stratified random sample. In the United States, 6962 physicians were randomly selected from two states in each of five regions of the country (Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest, and Pacific). Physicians from seven medical specialties (Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Rheumatology, Orthopedic Surgery, Neurosurgery, and Neurology) were surveyed and 1912 (27.46%) responded. A survey consisting of questions regarding years of practice, number of chronic pain patients treated, frequency of prescribing long-term opioids, concerns about opioids, goals of treatment, beliefs about education regarding opioids, and concerns about regulatory pressures was used. Based on the physicians who responded, it appears that prescription of long-term opioids is relatively wide-spread. Differences were noted by region, specialty, and the requirement for the use of multiple prescriptions for schedule II drugs. Physicians in the Midwestern United States were the least likely to prescribe the long-term use of opioids. Rheumatologists and general practitioners were significantly more likely to prescribe long-term opioids than were surgeons, neurologists, or physiatrists and were more likely to emphasize the importance of symptom improvement as an appropriate goal even in the absence of functional improvements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

Intrathecal infusion of morphine and bupivacaine through a catheter inserted at the L2-L3 level was also found to be ineffective; only a segment block was observed. A structural anomaly of the spine was suspected and confirmed by myelography, showing metastasis at L3. Pain relief improved when an infusion of morphine+bupivacaine was employed through a catheter placed at the L4-L5 level below the blockage. A major problem which continued throughout the course of the disease was the daily occurrence of episodes of unbearable sharp pain that required addition of midazolam to the local anesthetic/opioid subarachnoid infusion. The patient received this mixture through an intrathecal port during the last 13 months of life, a gradually increasing dose being necessary. Periods of analgesia were followed by occasional crises of intense sharp pain suggesting incomplete relief. No serious complications or meningitis occurred.

Tizanidine increased to normal levels the intensity of a noxious pressure stimulus required to induce paw withdrawal (p < 0.01) and decreased the duration of limb withdrawal from both normal-temperature and cooled floors in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01). Tizanidine had virtually no effect on the latency of paw withdrawal from a noxious heat stimulus. In comparison, morphine significantly decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, limb withdrawal from the normal-temperature and cooled floors and increased to cutoff values the withdrawal latencies of both noxious heat and pressure stimuli (p < 0.01). The effect of tizanidine was limited to the hyperalgesic limb and served to normalize reactive latencies, whereas morphine affected both hindlimbs and increased latencies to supranormal cutoff values. These data suggest that intrathecal tizanidine may be more specific than morphine in reversing the allodynia and hyperpathia associated with neuropathic pain states and may be of value in the management of patients with these clinical syndromes.",E,E

The transhepatic approach was used for all the procedures. Epidural anesthesia was used in 140 procedures and IV sedation was used in 123. Both epidural anesthesia and IV sedation were used in 31 patients who required multiple procedures. The efficacy of each method for control of pain was determined by a subjective rating of the patients' pain during the procedure: from 0 (no pain) to +3 (severe). The ratings were compiled and compared for each of the methods to ascertain which technique best achieved the desired effect. The pain control used depended on the urgency of the procedures and the availability of an anesthesiologist to administer epidural anesthetic. When an anesthesiologist was unavailable, IV sedation was used. The type and amount of drug administered depended on the patient's preference and history.; Of the 140 procedures done with epidural anesthesia, patients had no pain to mild pain in 127 (91%) and moderate to severe pain in 13 (9%). All instances of moderate to severe pain were the result of unsuccessful attempts to establish or maintain anesthesia. Of the 123 procedures done with IV sedation, patients had no pain to mild pain in 62 (50%) and moderate to severe pain in 61 (50%). Complications were more frequent when IV sedation was used. Six (5%) occurred, and all were related to hypotension. The hypotensive episodes occurred early in the study, before monitoring of patients was improved; now, continuous updates on vital signs are provided throughout the interventional procedure. With epidural anesthesia, hypotension developed in only one patient (< 1%) and the patient responded to fluid administration.; When it is successful, epidural anesthesia can completely eliminate moderate to severe pain in patients undergoing biliary procedures. IV sedation is only 50% effective in this regard. The greater efficacy of epidural anesthesia, coupled with the significantly lower prevalence of hypotension, justifies the additional cost and time associated with epidural anesthesia for pain management in biliary procedures.",E,E

Eliminating the causes of pain has a clear advantage over symptomatic treatment using analgetics, a fact worth a good consideration especially with the post-operative sojourn at the hospital becoming shorter and shorter. In a prospective controlled study, involving 42 patients subdivided into four groups namely, higher or lower insufflation pressures, chemically inert insufflation gas and control groups; the use of analgetics, lung function, operation duration, amount of insufflated gas, intraperitoneal pH-values and post-operative complications in the various subgroups were compared to each other with regard to post-operative pain perception. The results did not show any significant differences among the groups regarding the main parameters like pH-value or different insufflation pressures etc. These results led to the termination of the study based on the raised criteria since we anticipated the actual cause of the shoulder pain to be due to an unknown factor. By the evaluation of the individual data, it became apparent that, the pains increase with increasing gas consumption, a fact which led to assumption that the pains are caused by a physical effect such as the cooling of the peritoneum.",E,E

Another questionnaire was sent to 480 members of the Finnish Society of Anaesthesiologists to ask how they administer opioids to adult patients. Answers were received from 95% of hospitals and 67% of anaesthetists. Dextropropoxyphene was the most common oral opioid and oxycodone was the most common parenteral opioid used in Finland. Parenteral opioids were consumed almost totally in the hospitals. The anaesthetists reported oxycodone to be the opioid of choice for premedication, postoperative pain and sedation of critically ill patients. Fentanyl was the opioid most commonly used intravenously during balanced anaesthesia and in epidural administration. Epidural opioids were administered by 77% of anaesthetists and patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) technique mostly for intravenous administration by 19%.

Additional fentanyl 1 microgram/kg intraoperatively and oxycodone 0.05 mg/kg postoperatively were administered for analgesia if needed.; Dexmedetomidine preoperatively induced 16% to 20% decreases in systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), and heart rate (p < 0.001), which were mainly abolished within the 4-hour postoperative follow-up period. A clinically significant decrease in arterial oxygen saturation was not observed. The subjective intensity of pain during tourniquet inflation was similar in both groups, but fewer intraoperative (p = 0.009) opioid analgesics were needed in the dexmedetomidine group. Dexmedetomidine decreased sympathoadrenal responses: plasma norepinephrine concentration decreased to one-fourth of the baseline level (p < 0.001), and one of its main metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, decreased by 27% (p < 0.001). Dexmedetomidine also prevented an increase in plasma epinephrine concentration following tourniquet inflation (p = 0.003). Dexmedetomidine induced subjective sedation (p = 0.002), but the Maddox Wing test did not show any statistically significant differences between the groups. General effectiveness was graded superior in the dexmedetomidine group (p < 0.001).; Dexmedetomidine is an effective premedication before i.v. regional anesthesia because it reduces patient anxiety, sympathoadrenal responses, and opioid analgesic requirements.",E,E

Fifty consecutive colonoscopy patients were randomized to receive either (i) intravenous ketobemidone hydrochloride 2.5 mg, midazolam 2.5 mg, and breathing air from a face mask with a demand valve (KHM) or (ii) intravenous saline and a breathing mixture of even parts of oxygen and nitrous oxide (Entonox) from the same valve setup. Patient discomfort during colonoscopy was assessed using visual analogue scales. All patients were allowed to stay for recovery as long as they wanted, and the time was measured. Modified recollection tests were performed prior to colonoscopy and when the patients left the Endoscopy Unit, in order to study the degree of mental impairment induced by the procedure and the medication. All patients had complete colonoscopies of the same duration in both groups. Discomfort during colonoscopy was rated the same in both groups (2p = 0.6413). Both groups of patients scored identically in the precolonoscopy recollection test. Most patients had a lower score after colonoscopy, but Entonox-treated patients scored significantly better than those with KHM (2p = 0.0250). Patients treated with Entonox opted to leave the Unit directly after the procedure (median 0 minutes; interquartile range 0-5 minutes) compared to 38 minutes for those with KHM (interquartile range 10-75 min), 2p < 0.001.

In this study, we seek to determine the efficacy of SST in cancer pain management and its potential neurotoxicity.; Eight patients with intractable cancer pain were studied. Pain intensity was assessed by patients on a four-grade scale (severe, moderate, mild, none). Additional analgesic drug requirements before and concomitant with SST treatment were used to evaluate the pain relief and assessed on a four-grade scale (poor, fair, good, or excellent). Spinal cords of five patients were autopsied.; The mean duration of SST treatment was 11.3 days. The mean daily dose was 1,252 micrograms (range 250-3,000 micrograms). In six patients the pain relief was rated ""excellent"" or ""good"" and in two patients it was assessed ""poor"" or ""fair"". None of the patients demonstrated any evidence of neurologic deficit related to the SST treatment. At autopsy, two patients exhibited a moderate demyelination of some spinal dorsal roots and one patient also had a slight demyelination of the dorsal columns.; SST administered intrathecally and epidurally was an effective analgesic in patients with terminal cancer. Because the described neuropathologic changes could also be cancer-related or result from chemotherapy or radiation therapy we suggest that further judicious use of SST is justified in this category of patients, if their pain remains unrelieved despite large doses of opioid analgesics.",E,E

The use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants will also be mentioned. Morphine remains the reference compound among centrally acting analgesics both for acute and chronic pain. Its mechanism of action is relatively well known as well as the role of opiate receptors. Paracetamol is largely used as analgesic for relief of slight to moderate pain. Its mechanism of action still remains unclear. Usually the tolerability of this compound is considered as being excellent. However overdosage can induce severe and possible lethal liver necrosis. Aspirin is also a very old and a largely used compound. Its inhibiting effect on cyclooxygenase acts mainly peripherally but it could also act centrally. According to the current knowledge of its mechanism of action, it seems that the main pharmacological properties as well as adverse events of aspirin are all related to its enzyme inhibiting effect. Slight to moderate pain, related or not to inflammatory disease responds well to aspirin and other NSAIDs.",E,E

Two hundred seventeen patients who were being treated for their pain at two different pain centers completed a medication questionnaire. The most common diagnosis was low back pain. One hundred twelve patients reported taking oral opioids for their pain.; Of the patients who reported taking opioids for their chronic pain, 83% felt that the opioids were moderately beneficial in relieving their pain; 25% felt that the opioid had not lost its ability to relieve the pain over time; 35% reported that they did not need to increase their medication; 36% expressed no fear of addiction or dependence; and 56% reported having no unwanted side effects.; The results suggest that chronic nonmalignant pain patients taking opioids for their pain reported some tolerance, fear of addiction, and side effects when taking opioids. However, despite these concerns, some of these patients felt that opioid therapy was very beneficial. Further investigations are needed to determine which patient characteristics predict benefit from opioid therapy for nonmalignant pain.",3,E

Mean stone diameter was 13 mm. (range 4 to 60). The success rate (defined as no debris or fragments less than 4 mm. in an asymptomatic patient) was 49% and the retreatment rate was 63%. Subjects reported moderate to severe pain during 70 treatment sessions (42%) despite sedation with parenteral narcotics (50 to 100 mg. meperidine and 50 mg. hydroxyzine intramuscularly). One patient had perirenal bleeding requiring a 7-unit blood transfusion. Of the treatments 24 (13%) were aborted, 10 due to pain and 13 because of inability of the operator to position the patient or localize the stone. These results appear to be inferior to those reported with alternative lithotriptors. Modifications that have been made in the Therasonics system may improve stone localization and treatment results.",E,E

When evaluating pharmaceutical interventions, it is inappropriate to identify the purchase price alone. Other relevant costs include the costs of time of doctors, nurses and other personnel in administering and monitoring the effects of the therapy, and the costs of treating any side-effects. This study estimates direct National Health Service (NHS) costs in the U.K. of current medical practice in managing severe cancer pain, using a review of the published literature and constructing a cost analysis for four 'typical' patients. Costs are estimated for patients with severe cancer pain in a hospital and an ambulatory setting, with oral and subcutaneous routes of drug administration. The study includes costs of drugs, supplies, equipment and personnel time. The results demonstrate the importance of personnel time costs, and potential cost savings which could result from the use of transdermally administered opioid analgesics.",2,E

Patients chose either the patient-controlled reduction (PCR) or cocktail reduction method, aiming to complete withdrawal by discharge. Use of opiates and other drugs was recorded, and psychological measures taken, at admission, at discharge, and at follow-ups. Patients who opted for the cocktail reduction method started at higher morphine equivalents (P < 0.001), were less confident in their ability to cope without medication (P < 0.05), and rated their everyday activities a more disrupted by pain (P < 0.05). At discharge, 89% of the cocktail group were abstinent from opiates compared with 68% of the PCR group (P < 0.05). By 1-month follow-up, the advantage of the cocktail method had disappeared, with no significant differences between the two groups in mean opiate dose, nor in the proportion of abstinent patients. This was the result of a greater return to opiate use in the cocktail group, with abstinence rates remaining unchanged in the PCR group. By 6-month follow-up, abstinence rates for the groups were equivalent, with 55% of patients remaining off opiates. By this stage, however, non-abstinent cocktail group patients were taking significantly larger doses of opiates than PCR patients (P < 0.05), although in both groups, the dose was well below admission level. Admission opiate dose level was the best predictor both of abstinence at discharge and of subsequent opiate dose level in non-abstinent patients. This study demonstrates that both reduction methods can produce substantial reduction in opiate use by severely impaired chronic pain patients with long medication histories.",E,E

There is little information available on the opinions and practices of physicians.; In June of 1992, we performed a national survey by mail of the four physician groups most commonly treating these problems. The number of respondents and response rates were as follows: family physicians, 118, 16%; neurologists, 100, 21%; neurosurgeons, 97, 23%; orthopedists, 82, 13%. The survey instrument contained items on demographics, definitions, causation, prognosis, medico-legal aspects, testing, and treatment.; Only a minority of respondents believe that PCS and WS are clearly defined syndromes. A substantial minority report that psychogenic and litigation factors are most responsible for the conditions. Most of the physicians believe that PCS and WS have a 3-6 month recovery time. A significant minority concur that symptoms of the two syndromes resolve when litigation is settled. Most of the physicians order tests to rule out pathology although a minority order tests to reassure patients or because of litigation concerns. Only a minority of respondents believe that effective treatments are available. Not surprisingly, a multitude of conventional and unconventional treatments are sometimes recommended.; Many aspects of PCS and WS are controversial among treating physicians. This controversy can have a profound impact on the quality and cost of patient care. Ongoing research is required to discover more effective treatments for mild brain injury and chronic pain.",E,E

Therefore, in the University Hospital of Kiel, Germany, an anaesthesiology-based acute pain service (APS) was started in 1985 to improve this situation. Organization of an APS. The anaesthesiologist in training who manages the recovery unit serves as an APS for surgical wards and is supervised by a consultant. The anaesthesists on call are responsible after regular working hours. The activities of the APS are as follows: 1. Induction of sufficient postoperative analgesia in the recovery unit for all surgical patients. 2. Clinical rounds on all patients receiving epidural analgesia (EA), other forms of regional analgesia, or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) every morning and throughout the day if necessary. 3. Additional consultations for postoperative pain management for other patients on request. 4. Assessment and documentation of the clinical status of the patient, quality of analgesia, and side effects. 5. Writing orders for further treatment. 6. Continuing consultations and informal education for ward nurses, physiotherapists, and surgical staff; formal medical training for ward nurses in postoperative pain management. Activity of the APS. From 1985 to 1992, 1947 patients on normal wards were treated (EA: 1736, PCA: 183). Epidural analgesia was performed using a standard protocol with bupivacaine 0.175%-0.25% infused continuously with top-ups if needed (mean 240 mg/day, range 75-600 mg; median duration 7 days, range 1-53, Table 1). Demand for further treatment was proved by day-to-day withdrawal. Since the introduction of an APS, complications of EA such as hypotension (1985/1986:5.1%; 1987/1992:0.5%, Table 3) and insufficient analgesia due to dislocation or other technical complications could be reduced significantly (Table 3). Dermal infections were seen in 2.6% of patients, with a significantly higher incidence in patients with arteriosclerotic diseases (4.1%). Epidural opioids were used in only 46 selected cases on surgical wards. Nevertheless, 2 cases of marked respiratory depression occurred. The overall risk of complications during postoperative EA could be reduced from 1:11 cases in the first 2 years to 1:20 in the last 6 years since introducing the APS. For other regional procedures (e.g., interpleural analgesia) no complications were recorded. PCA was performed using a standard protocol with tramadol or piritramide without background infusion (Table 6). The loading dose was titrated in the recovery unit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",E,E

Since, during the withdrawal phase, enhancement of pain intensity together with other abstinence phenomena are to be expected, hospitalization is usually indicated. Psychosomatic pain syndromes with dependence on benzodiazepine derivatives represent the second largest group. In these patients, withdrawal is effected stepwise, usually on an outpatient basis. Opioid analgesics administered to patients to treat chronic pain do not necessarily lead to the development of tolerance. Occasionally, dependency is observed in organic or psychosomatic pain states.

Forty-one patients were available for final follow-up in May 1991: 22 in the open group, 19 in the arthroscopic group. Comparisons of pain, function, motion, and strength were made preoperatively and at 2, 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks postoperatively. Final analysis showed that the main benefits of arthroscopic acromioplasty were evident in the first 3 months postoperatively. Arthroscopic patients regained flexion and strength more rapidly than did open patients, had shorter hospitalizations, used less narcotics, and returned more quickly to both work and activities of daily living. By 3 months postoperatively, open patients tended to ""catch up"" with arthroscopic patients, and further recovery was equivalent. In both groups, full recovery took at least 1 year for the majority of patients and in both groups at 1 year > 90% of patients achieved a satisfactory result. Because of its medical and economic advantages for both the patient and the health-care system, we conclude that arthroscopic acromioplasty should become the procedure of choice for patients with impingement syndrome refractory to conservative treatment.",E,E

The aim of this work was to assess, in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats, the pharmacological activity to several analgesic drugs known to be effective (clomipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine, clonidine, lidocaine), ineffective (aspirin), or with a doubtful effectiveness (morphine) in human painful diabetic neuropathy. The animals were submitted to a mechanical pain test (paw pressure) and the ability of the drugs to reverse diabetes-induced hyperalgesia was tested. The tested antidepressants (0.125-8 mg/kg, i.v.) were slightly effective in diabetic rats; amitriptyline and clomipramine induced a weak effect, whereas desipramine was more active, suggesting noradrenergic specificity. This was confirmed by the effectiveness of clonidine (50, 100, 150 micrograms/kg, s.c.). Lidocaine (1-9 mg/kg, i.v.) had prolonged efficacy on mechanical hyperalgesia. Aspirin (100 mg/kg, i.v.) was without effect and morphine (0.5-4 mg/kg, i.v.) induced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect but at doses twice as high as those used in normal rats. These results demonstrate the high pharmacological predictivity of this model of painful diabetes and suggest that in this pathological condition, among the drugs acting on monoaminergic transmission, noradrenergic drugs seem the most active.",E,E

Surgeons, patients, and the acute pain service were blinded as to drug selection. After the patient was sedated, an interscalene block was placed with the use of a nerve stimulator to facilitate proper needle placement. Forty milliliters of either 0.5% bupivacaine or 0.75% etidocaine containing 5 micrograms/mL epinephrine was injected into the brachial plexus sheath. An additional 8 mL of local anesthetic was administered for superficial cervical plexus blockade. Intraoperative sedation was accomplished with an intravenous infusion of methohexital as needed. After surgery, patients received a standard patient-controlled analgesia protocol providing incremental doses of morphine. The degree of postoperative analgesia resulting from residual local anesthetic effect was expressed as the time until first morphine requirement and the total dose of morphine required during the first 24 hours postoperatively. We found no statistically significant intergroup differences either in time of initial use of morphine or in the total dose of morphine required in the first 24 hours. Both etidocaine and bupivacaine provide prolonged analgesia after major shoulder surgery when injected into the brachial plexus. Bupivacaine, however, possesses significant cardiotoxicity and has a relatively delayed onset in peripheral neural blockade. Etidocaine is less cardiotoxic and also has a more rapid onset of effect. Thus etidocaine may be a preferable agent for interscalene block for major shoulder surgery.",E,E

The study group comprised 176 patients with moderate, severe, or very severe pain after hip or knee surgery at a teaching hospital. Patients received either 10 mg of ketorolac orally, 10 mg of morphine intramuscularly, 5 mg of morphine IM, or placebo. Patients rated pain intensity at baseline and pain intensity and pain relief at 30 minutes, 1 hour, and hourly thereafter for 6 hours. At study completion, we evaluated overall patient ratings of pain relief and occurrence of adverse events. Summed pain intensity difference scores and total pain relief scores showed the active medications to be significantly superior to placebo and not significantly different from each other. The 10-mg dose of morphine showed a small advantage over ketorolac in peak analgesic effect, but the onset of pain relief was comparable among the active agents. The incidence of adverse events among the active-treatment groups was similar, though there was a numerical trend favoring ketorolac over 10 mg of morphine. We found oral ketorolac to be an effective alternative to parenteral opioids for the treatment of pain after hip or knee surgery in patients who can tolerate oral medication.",E,E

In addition, there was relatively low use of either inpatient or outpatient medical services after treatment. These patient behaviors were specific goals of the pain management program in which these patients had participated. Interesting data were also collected on medication use after treatment and methods of pain control used most successfully.

In addition to spinal control mechanisms of nociceptive transmission, descending pathways that originate in three major areas--the cortex, thalamus, and brain stem--can modify functions at the spinal level. At every level of the nervous system, a close relationship prevails between somatic pain pathways and visceral pathways. This relationship likely accounts for the transmission of visceral pain and also for autonomic responses to somatic pain and somatic responses to visceral pain.; By understanding the pathways of pain and the transmitters involved, prevention and treatment of pain will be improved.",E,E

In addition to infection, complications include severe pain, cerebrovascular accidents, cholelithiasis, bone infarction, heart failure, hypotension and priapism. The most common cause of early childhood death is septicemia or meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Complications may be reduced or prevented by early diagnosis through newborn screening, patient education, routine immunizations, administration of folic acid, pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations, penicillin prophylaxis, and early diagnosis and aggressive treatment of complications.",E,E

Preoperative diagnosis was 40 right inguinal hernias (RIH), 33 left inguinal hernias (LIH), and 6 bilateral hernias. Intraoperatively, 30 RIH, 22 LIH (1 patient also had a left incisional hernia), 26 bilateral hernias, and 2 femoral hernias were diagnosed and repaired. Twenty patients (25%) had contralateral hernias diagnosed intraoperatively. Average operating time for unilateral repairs was 76 minutes and for bilateral repairs was 110 minutes. Forty-three percent of patients underwent day-care surgery, and 35% were discharged on the first postoperative day. Postoperative complications included 6 cases of transient neuralgias (7%), 3 cord/scrotal hematomas (4%), 1 trocar site hematoma (1%), and 1 case of chronic pain (1%). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 12 months with no recurrences.

Intravenous morphine requirements while in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and during the following 24 hours, as well as the incidence of pruritus, nausea, naloxone usage, and bleeding were also recorded. Results were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum, Fischer's exact, chi-square, and Student's t tests.; Patients receiving intravenous ketorolac (group 2) in addition to subarachnoid opioids had significantly lower pain scores 1 hour after surgery, and required less supplementary intravenous morphine within the first 24 postoperative hours (P < .05). The percentage of patients requiring no analgesic intervention while in the PACU was significantly higher for those receiving ketorolac (P = .01). The incidence of opioid-related side effects was similar between groups, and no perioperative bleeding was observed.; When used in conjunction with subarachnoid opioids, the scheduled administration of intravenous ketorolac during the first 24 hours after major urologic surgery significantly enhances analgesia and reduces the need for supplemental intravenous opioids without affecting the incidence of side effects.

The combination of these two modalities in relieving post-thoracotomy pain and improving postoperative pulmonary function has not been investigated.; In a double-blind study, 20 patients undergoing lateral thoracotomy for lung resection were randomized to receive 0.5 mg SM preoperatively and INB with bupivacaine (INB+) prior to wound closure or 0.5 mg SM with INB using saline (INB-). Visual analog scale pain scores at rest, with cough, and with movement of the ipsilateral arm, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the operation. Opioid use was measured during the initial 24 hours after the operation.; At 4 hours, the INB+ group demonstrated better FEV1 (56.6% vs. 40.4% of baseline, P < .05) and FVC values (54.6% vs. 39.6% of baseline, P < .05) and less resting and cough pain (P < .05). However, FEV1 continued to decline in the INB+ group at 24 hours to lower than the INB- group although pain scores were similar beyond 4 hours. Opioid usage during the first 24 hours was similar (INB-, 16.7 mg vs. INB+, 13.2 mg, P = .7).; Although postoperative INB provided modest improvements in pain and pulmonary function when used as an adjuvant to 0.5 mg SM for post-thoracotomy analgesia, the benefits were transient. The authors do not recommend adding INB for patients undergoing lateral thoracotomy who receive 0.5 mg SM.",E,E

The hypothesis was that, although the concentration of bupivacaine (0.1%) was low to minimize its adverse effects, if the infusion rate of a fentanyl/bupivacaine solution was closely adjusted according to need, the presence bupivacaine would reduce the requirement for epidural fentanyl.; Forty patients were randomly assigned to receive either fentanyl (10 micrograms/mL) or a fentanyl/bupivacaine (0.1%) mixture epidurally corresponding to the dermatome of the surgical incision in a double-blind fashion for the first 18 hours after major abdominal surgery. The infusion was titrated for each patient to the rate required for pain relief during forced inspiration (pain score < or = 2, maximum 10). Pain scores, the fentanyl doses required, plasma concentrations of fentanyl at 18 hours, and the incidence and severity of adverse effects were recorded.; Patients reported similar median pain scores and were equally satisfied with pain relief in both groups. The mean required post-operative fentanyl infusion rate (57.7 +/- 19.5 micrograms/h) and the plasma concentrations (0.84 +/- 0.36 ng/mL) in the fentanyl group were comparable to the infusion rate (54.4 +/- 19.2 micrograms/h) and the plasma concentrations (0.86 +/- 0.36 ng/mL) in the fentanyl/bupivacaine group. Respiratory and cardiovascular functions were preserved, and the incidence of nausea, pruritus, and periods of drowsiness or sleep were similar in both groups.; In low concentrations (0.1%), bupivacaine did not reduce the titrated dose of epidural fentanyl required for adequate pain relief during forced inspiration after major abdominal surgery. The incidence and severity of adverse effects were also comparable whether or not low-dose bupivacaine infusion was used.",E,E

A new technique.,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain, Postoperative; Ribs; Surgical Instruments; Thoracic Surgery; Video Recording","Richardson, J; Sabanathan, S","We undertook a re-evaluation of acute and chronic pain generation following Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) with regard to chest wall trauma produced by the instruments and their ports. From intercostal space (ICS) measurements made on 40 patients, it was confirmed that both the camera and the staple gun port diameters are too large for insertion without trauma. An instrument was produced (the ""Sari"" Punch, Bolton Surgical Services, Sheffield, England) which cleanly excises an elipse of the superior aspect of a rib, prior to the introduction of the ports. At the same time, the recommended orbit of the instruments about the surgical focus was abandoned in favour of an alignment along one ICS so that only one nerve was potentially traumatised. These modifications were then combined with balanced, pre-emptive and continuous paravertebral analgesia and the efficacy of this approach was evaluated in nine patients undergoing VATS. Operation of the rib punch was easy in all patients and was carried out without clinical or radiological trauma to the rib. Insertion of the ports was easy and access was good to all intrathoracic structures. Postoperative analgesia was good and the mean hospital stay was 2.7 days (range 2-4). Follow-up two months later confirmed a satisfactory surgical procedure and no patients complained of chest wall pain or numbness. We conclude that pain generation with VATS must be seriously considered if the technique is to become truly successful. Balanced, pre-emptive, paravertebral analgesia will protect the central nervous system while the removal of an elipse of rib and alignment of the instruments along one ICS will reduce the likelihood of peripheral nerve trauma.",E,E

For postoperative analgesia the patients received randomly and double-blind patient-controlled intravenous or epidural analgesia with sufentanil. Within 15 minutes after the initial intravenous bolus injection of 15 micrograms sufentanil respiratory depression occurred in 4 patients. This was alerted by the Oscar-CO2-Monitor and -Pulsoximeter. Oxygen saturation time patterns of pulsoximetry and blood gas analysis correlated significantly (p < 0.001), although the mean values of the methods differed (NS). In contrast, carbon-dioxide pressure time patterns of capnometry and blood gas analysis correlated less significantly (p < 0.01) although the mean values of the methods correlated significantly (p < 0.01). Concomittant monitoring via pulsoximeter and capnometer is therefore superior to regulary assessments of respiratory rate and blood gas analysis and potentially useful for the clinical routine.",E,E

This review covers pre-clinical and clinical studies from both allogeneic and xenogeneic sources. One cell source that has been utilized successfully is the adrenal chromaffin cell, since such cells constitutively release catecholamines, opioid peptides, and neurotrophic factors; release can be augmented with nicotine. Other graft sources include AtT-20 and B-16 cell lines which release enkephalins and catecholamines, respectively. For grafting in rodents, adrenal medullary tissue pieces are transplanted to the subarachnoid space. Chromaffin cell transplants can decrease pain sensitivity in normal rats using standard acute pain tests (paw-pinch, hot-plate, and tail-flick). In addition, transplants can restore normal pain thresholds in rodent models of chronic pain (formalin, adjuvant-induced arthritis, and sciatic-nerve tie) which closely similate the pathologies of human chronic pain conditions. Xenografts have been studied due to concerns that future application for human pain may be limited by donor availability. Despite immune privileges of the CNS, xenografts require at least short-term immunosuppression to obtain a viable graft. Cell encapsulation is one method of sustaining a xenograft (in rat and human hosts) while circumventing the need for immunosuppression. Clinical studies have been initiated for terminal cancer patients with promising results as assessed by markedly reduced narcotic intake, visual analog scale ratings, and increased CSF levels of catecholamines and met-enkephalin.",E,E

A propofol infusion was initiated at 75 micrograms/kg/min and then varied to maintain a stable level of sedation (i.e., Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale score of 3). An additional 1 ml of the same study medication was administered IV 2 to 3 minutes prior to infiltration of the local anesthetic solution. During the operation, supplemental (rescue) medication consisted of fentanyl 25 micrograms IV, bolus injections in all four treatment groups.; Propofol infusion and supplemental fentanyl dosage requirements, oxygen saturation values, respiratory rates, recovery times, and postoperative side effects were recorded. Visual analog scales were used to assess sedation, anxiety, pain, and nausea preoperatively (baseline), upon entry into the postanesthesia care unit, and at 30-minute intervals until discharge. The fentanyl and dezocine groups required lower average infusion rates of propofol to maintain a stable level of sedation than the control (saline) group. The saline and ketorolac groups required rescue analgesic medication more frequently and/or larger supplemental dosages of fentanyl than the two opioid analgesic treatment groups. Compared with the three analgesic treatment groups, postoperative pain scores were only marginally higher in the control group. Ketorolac-treated patients had consistently (but not significantly) shorter recovery times to oral intake, ambulation, and discharge than those in the dezocine or fentanyl groups. No postoperative nausea, vomiting, or pruritus was reported in the ketorolac group.; Compared with ketorolac 60 mg, fentanyl 100 micrograms and dezocine 6 mg produced a greater decrease in the propofol sedation requirement during MAC.

All patients received intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled analgesia device (PCA). Post-operative pain intensity was assessed hourly for 4 h, by recording visual analogue score (VAS) for pain, PCA demands and actual morphine administered. PCA demands (mean +/- SD) were greater in the saline treatment group (115 +/- 90) when compared with both the ketorolac (42 +/- 44) and diclofenac groups (74 +/- 77). Furthermore, the saline treatment group received significantly (P < 0.05) more PCA morphine compared with both the ketorolac and diclofenac groups (12.2 mg +/- 5.0 vs. 8.6 mg +/- 5.2 vs. 8.9 mg +/- 4.8). Improved pain scores were demonstrated in both the ketorolac and diclofenac groups compared with the saline group. PCA demands and post-operative morphine requirements were similar in the ketorolac and diclofenac groups. Diclofenac has the added advantage, in our institution, of being 60% less expensive than ketorolac. We conclude that both ketorolac and diclofenac are effective post-operative analgesic drugs.

The knowledge of the principles and methods of cancer pain treatment were evaluated with 9 open and 19 multiple-choice questions. The ability of the physicians to apply their knowledge in practice was evaluated by analyzing their suggested treatment of 3 illustrative case histories. The favourite drugs in treating cancer pain were strong opioid agonists, suggested by 25% of the general practitioners and 44% of the specialists for a typical cancer pain patient. The recommended daily doses of opioids were mostly far below the level generally accepted in palliative care. The drug of choice for metastatic bone pain was a combination of paracetamol and codeine, chosen by a third of the general practitioners.

Following a 3-7-day diary familiarization period, patients were randomly assigned to 7 days of treatment each with CR codeine q12h or placebo. The CR codeine dose was determined from the consumption of acetaminophen+codeine in the 7 days preceding the study. During both phases, breakthrough pain was treated with acetaminophen+codeine every 4 h as required. Pain intensity was assessed at 08:00 h and 20:00 h using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a 5-point categorical scale, and rescue analgesic consumption was recorded at the time of use. Thirty patients (17 female, 13 male; mean age: 55.1 +/- 13.4 years) completed the study and were treated with a mean daily CR codeine dose of 273 +/- 78 mg (range: 200-400 mg). CR codeine treatment resulted in significantly lower overall VAS pain intensity scores (35 +/- 18 vs. 49 +/- 16, P = 0.0001), categorical pain intensity scores (1.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.6, P = 0.0001), and in pain scores by day of treatment and by time of day.

The incidence of nausea was significantly higher on CR codeine than on placebo (32.6% vs. 11.9%, P = 0.013). Ninety-three percent of patients completing the study requested long-term, open-label treatment with CR codeine. Pain intensity scores at the completion of 19 weeks of long-term evaluation were comparable to those during the double-blind CR codeine treatment.

Analgesic potency was also assessed using an ischaemic pain test and other toxic effects were monitored. 2. Following morphine there was a significant increase in arterial PCO2, as measured by blood gases 45 min post dose (0.54 +/- 0.24 (s.d.) kPa, P < 0.001), and in transcutaneous PCO2 from 15 min post dose until the end of the study period (4 h), whereas blood gas and transcutaneous PCO2 were unchanged after M6G at 1.0, 3.3 and 5.0 mg 70 kg-1. This increased PCO2 following morphine was associated with an increase in expired CO2 concentration (FECO2) (0.20 +/- 0.14% expired air at 15 min post dose, P = 0.002), compared with small but significant reductions in FECO2 following morphine 6-glucuronide (-0.15 +/- 0.17% at 1 mg 70 kg-1 P = 0.030, -0.14 +/- 0.15% at 3.3 mg 70 kg-1 P = 0.017, -0.18 +/- 0.11% at 5 mg 70 kg-1 P = 0.024).

Further analysis of the time course data led to the tentative conclusion that all groups of animals became tolerant at the same rate, regardless of drug or dose. A literature search revealed then, as it does now, that although there are many statements regarding the rate of opioid tolerance, there has been little systematic investigation of this. The Holy Grail of obtaining the rates of tolerance for a number of opioid agents in a systematic study is well within grasp. This information will be needed in clinical practice for the rational choice of opioid with regard to rate of the development of tolerance. The working hypothesis that emerges for the magnitude of opioid tolerance is that more potent agonists produce less tolerance. Further confirmation of this hypothesis has been forthcoming. This suggests that clinical use of more potent opioids, such as fentanyl, should be considered as a substitute for morphine in long term treatment regimens. The working hypothesis for cross-tolerance is that agents acting on the same receptors will show cross-tolerance. Cross-tolerance will also be observed among agents acting on different receptors, but only those that exhibit pharmacological synergy after short term administration. Asymmetry of cross-tolerance can occur, as the magnitude of this cross-tolerance is determined by the relative potency of the toleragen with regard to that of the probe agent. Given the additional factor of receptor selectivity with agents of different receptor classes, types and subtypes, new studies need to be designed combining the toleragen with a selective antagonist to determine the precise receptor mediation of the magnitude of tolerance, and thus cross-tolerance. For example, the delta opioid DADLE infused with a mu selective opioid antagonist would produce an animal strictly tolerant at delta receptors, as DADLE has been implicated to have some effects at mu receptors. In any event, consideration of the quantitative measures of cross-tolerance are extremely important to help shape a rationale treatment plan for patients who may become tolerant to a particular class of analgesics. In general, direct toleragen administration by constant dose, constant rate infusion into local central nervous system (CNS) regions will provide the most rigorous tolerance studies for examination of the pharmacodynamic theories of tolerance, as adaptations in processes affecting central bioavailability, such as dispositional changes in the blood-brain barrier or fibrous encapsulation of an implanted subcutaneous pellet, are circumvented. The above considerations also are relevant for studies of tolerance and cross-tolerance after intracerebroventricular administration or, in general, for tolerance studies after systemic administration. The possibility of probe administration to the same region of CNS that was rendered tolerant, as in the Y-catheter method, further enhances the focus on the pharmacodynamic mechanisms of tolerance without the ancillary and literally peripheral concerns of a dispositional nature. A posological approach to these studies cannot be overemphasized, as it is only through such time consuming and costly experiments that rigorous, quantitative data can be obtained. Such data may help to guide the hand of the physician towards rational therapeutic intervention in the treatment of patients with chronic pain and opioid tolerance.",E,E

Pain crises are recurrent episodes of pain that range in severity from mild to severe, usually occur very abruptly and are often localized around joints. Pain crises are caused by vaso-occlusions in the vascular bed of the bone marrow, leading to necrosis, edema and increased pressure. For effective analgesia morphine or morphine analogues are often required. When treating a pain crisis the patient's complaints need to be taken seriously and analgesic therapy should be started promptly with analgesics in proportion to the severity of the patient's pain. With mild pain oral non-opioid analgesics are sufficient, in moderate pain they are given in combination with oral codeine. Severe pain requires IV morphine, also combined with a non-opioid analgesic. Intravenous morphine makes a thorough monitoring of ventilation and level of consciousness mandatory. Sickle cell patients do not become drug dependent if given morphine for adequate analgesia. While bone marrow transplantation has become an accepted treatment modality for sickle cell patients with severe pain crises, treatment with hydroxyurea to increase HbF levels and reduce incidence and severity of pain crises, however, is still experimental.",E,E

Patients, and physicians, and nurses were interviewed. A verbal pain intensity scale was used to determine whether patients received adequate analgesia. Patients were asked if the pain hindered their activities, and whether they requested pain medication from their caregivers. Caregivers were questioned whether patients received adequate analgesia. Prescribed morphine regimens and the amount of narcotic administered were analyzed. Twenty-seven percent of patients rated pain intensity as moderate and 47% as severe. Ninety-five percent of housestaff and 81% of nurses reported the patients received adequate pain control. Forty-seven percent of the patients who had moderate or severe pain asked their physician for more pain medication, and 65% asked the nurse. Thirteen residents did not order a larger dose of morphine due to concern about respiratory depression or hypotension. Morphine dosages ranged from 1-8 mg intravenously every 1-2 hours as necessary. Nurses administered less than the maximum amount ordered 58% of the time. The mean dosing interval was 2.3 hours.

The central pain syndrome included spontaneous continuous and intermittent pain as well as evoked pain. Pain was evoked by non-noxious stimulation of the skin (allodynia) and by repeated pricking of the skin (wind-up-like pain). The severity of continuous and evoked pain was examined before and after the intravenous infusion of either the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine (6 micrograms/kg/min after a bolus dose of 60 micrograms/kg), the mu-opioid receptor agonist alfentanil (0.6 microgram/kg/min after after a bolus dose of 7 micrograms/kg), or placebo (0.9% NaCl). A randomized, double-blind, crossover study design was used. It was found that both continuous and evoked pain were markedly reduced by the blockade of NMDA receptors by ketamine as well as by the activation of mu-opioid receptors by alfentanil. Neither ketamine nor alfentanil significantly changed thresholds for the sensation of heat pain. The reduction of pain was not associated with severe side effects; the most severe side effect of ketamine was bothersome dizziness in one patient, and only modest side effects were caused by alfentanil. The present data provide clinical evidence that the development of central dysesthesia pain after traumatic spinal cord injury is dependent on the activation of central NMDA receptors. The results further indicate that mu-opioid receptors are involved in the control of this type of pain.",E,E

Pain varies tremendously from one patient to the next, and there are also some studies suggesting that the intensity of pain varies according to time of day. In animal experiments, a relationship between the reaction to pain and the rhythmicity of plasma endorphin concentrations was suggested because reactions to pain (such as jumping from a hot plate) were in phase with plasma endorphin levels: latencies were longest and plasma levels were highest during the resting period of rodents. In human studies, pain induced experimentally was reported to be maximal in the morning, or in the afternoon or at night. These divergent findings may be due to methodological differences, as pain was produced by different methods, many parameters were used to quantify pain intensity, and the psychological aspect of pain was rarely considered by authors. A circadian pattern of pain was found in patients suffering from pain produced by different diseases. For instance, highest toothache intensity occurred in the morning, while biliary colic, migraine, and intractable pain were highest at night. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis reported peak pain early in the morning, while those with osteoarthritis of the knee indicated that the maximal pain occurred at the end of the day. The effectiveness of opioids appears also to vary according to time of day, but large differences in the time of peak and low effects were found. Investigators found that peak pain intensity and narcotic demands occurred early in the morning, while others found maximal pain at the end of the day. Pain is a complex phenomenon and efforts should be made to standardize the methods used in studies and to describe accurately the diseases causing pain because the patterns of pain may be specific to each clinical situation. Further research should be aimed at characterizing the chronobiology of pain in different experimental and clinical situations and to determine when the analgesic drugs are producing maximal effectiveness. This information is needed before clinicians can be persuaded to use chronopharmacological data when they prescribe analgesic drugs to their patients.",E,E

Measurements of pain reduction, activity improvement, oral medication use, and overall satisfaction by patient, spouse, and clinic staff were obtained. Of the 26 patients, 20 noted a good or excellent outcome. Average daily dosage of intrathecal morphine increased over time by approximately sevenfold. Subjective pain levels decreased an average of 59%, and daily functioning increased 50%.

Data production has, however, continued and this review correlates this new information with existing knowledge. Its history, taxonomy, anatomy, indications, techniques, mechanisms of analgesia, efficacy, contraindications, toxicity, side effects and complications are reviewed. Thoracic paravertebral analgesia is advocated for surgical procedures of the thorax and abdomen, especially wherever the afferent input is predominantly unilateral eg. thoracotomy, cholecystectomy and nephrectomy. It is also of benefit in the prevention and management of chronic pain. It is a simple undertaking with impressive efficacy. Plasma local anaesthetic levels are acceptable and its side effect and complication rates are low. No mortality has been reported. For unilateral surgery of the chest or truck, thoracic paravertebral analgesia should be considered as the afferent block of choice. For bilateral surgery, its efficacy may be limited by the doses of local anaesthetic which could safely be used and further study in this area in particular is required. This form of afferent blockade deserves greater consideration and investigation.",E,E

The morphine test did not show any significant changes. The lidocaine test showed a pain decrease during and after the infusion. The ketamine test showed a significant reduction in pain intensity during and after the test period. Tenderness at tender points decreased and endurance increased significantly, while muscle strength remained unchanged. The present results support the hypothesis that the NMDA receptors are involved in pain mechanisms in fibromyalgia. These findings also suggest that central sensitization is present in FM and that tender points represent secondary hyperalgesia.",E,E

Of these, 10 (3%) were missed in the screening process, 132 (43%) declined participation, 73 (24%) were excluded, and 92 (30%) were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group.; Ninety-two patients were enrolled in the study. Two patients never received the medication to which they were assigned, owing to administrative error; their data was not analyzed. Of the remaining patients, 31 were randomized to the PCA morphine group, 31 were randomized to the IM morphine group, and 28 were randomized to the IM ketorolac group. The randomly assigned drug was first administered in the post-anesthesia care unit. On arrival on the postoperative ward, the patient was asked to rate his or her pain using both a numerical rating scale and a visual analog scale at 30 minutes; 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after arrival on the ward; and every 4 hours throughout the first 5 postoperative days. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered the day before surgery and then daily for the first 5 postoperative days. The first day the patient passed flatus after surgery was also recorded.; The end points analyzed were adverse effects, duration of postoperative ileus, degree of pain control, length of hospitalization, and development of postoperative confusion as measured on serial MMSEs.; Only two patients, both in the PCA group, reported adverse effects; neither required a change in analgesia group. Significantly more patients assigned to IM ketorolac broke protocol and required alternative analgesia than did patients in the morphine groups (32% ketorolac vs 16% IM morphine and 0% PCA). The ketorolac group had a significantly shorter duration of ileus than either morphine group (P<.0l). The ketorolac group also had significantly lower pain scores (P<.04) and less postoperative confusion than the morphine groups (P<.03), although these results are limited by missing values. The ketorolac group had a significantly shorter length of stay than either morphine group (P<.01), while there was no significant difference between the morphine groups (P=.75).; While it appears that ketorolac provides a better postoperative course than either IM or PCA morphine in terms of pain control, postoperative confusion, length of stay, and duration of ileus, 18% of our patients assigned to ketorolac required additional analgesia, and there was a strong patient preference for PCA. Most patients should probably be managed with PCA narcotics, but the addition of ketorolac might reduce narcotic dose and resultant adverse effects.

While preemptive analgesic treatment with numerous agents has been successful in experimental animals, results of human studies remain conflicting. The authors used a multimodal approach for preemptive analgesia before abdominal surgery: diclofenac and metamizole inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, thus influencing peripheral sensitization; epidural local anesthetics induce conduction block, epidural opioids inhibit nociceptive synaptic transmission, and metamizole induces descending inhibition. The interaction of these drugs might suppress spinal nociceptive sensitization and postoperative analgesic demand.; One hundred forty-two patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to one of three groups and studied prospectively. Epidural catheters in groups 1 and 2 were placed at interspaces T8-T10, the position of the catheter was confirmed by epidurography, and sensory testing after administration of 5 ml mepivacaine 1%. Group 1 received 75 mg intramuscular diclofenac, 1000 mg intravenous metamizole, 5.3 +/- 1 mg epidural morphine, and 15-20 ml mepivacaine 1% 85 +/- 41 min before skin incision. Epidural analgesia was maintained by injections of 0.1 ml.kg-1.h-1 mepivacaine 1%. Group 2 patients received the balanced analgesia regimen before wound closure (221 +/- 86 min after skin incision).

Morphine solutions were infused subcutaneously in concentrations between 1% and 3%. The intravenous route was preferred in patients with indwelling catheters or those susceptible to inflammatory skin reactions at the infusion site. After initial dose adjustment, lasting 2-3 days, the morphine amounts infused by PCA reached a median of 93 mg day(-1) (range 12-464 mg day(-1)). The median was 28% lower than the median dose administered orally. A total of 84% of patients utilized the option of bolus self-administration. The median percentage administered via the bolus mode amounted to 5.3% of the total requirements. During the course of treatment, morphine requirements increased by a median of 2.3 mg day(-1) (range -29 +52 mg day(-1)). Most patients were treated continuously in the home care setting until death, the median duration being 27 days (range 1-437 days). The terminal morphine demands reached a median of 188 mg day(-1) (range 15-1008 mg day(-1)). PCA turned out to be safe and effective, attaining excellent results in 95 (66%) patients and satisfactory pain relief in 43 (30%). PCA proved to be insufficient in five (4%) cases. Side-effects were mild: constipation, fatigue, nausea and local inflammatory skin reactions occurred in 9%. Thus, with support from an experienced mobile nursing team, PCA can be safely administered in the terminal domiciliary care of tumour patients. PCA is superior to oral analgesia, especially in the treatment of severe oscillating pain. PCA provides adequate pain control in about 96% of patients who are poorly responsive to oral opioids.",E,E

A human model of central sensitization would be useful in screening new NMDA antagonists and establishing dose regimens for clinical trials in patients with pain related to sensitization of CNS neurons. We used this model to examine the effects of intravenous infusions of two centrally acting analgesics, the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine and the morphine-like opioid agonist alfentanil. Twelve normal subjects completed a 3-session, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. From 25 to 60 min after capsaicin injection, subjects were given intravenous infusions of ketamine (mean dose: 32 mg), alfentanil (mean dose: 3075 micrograms), or saline placebo. Both drugs significantly reduced ongoing pain and pinprick-evoked hyperalgesia during the infusion. The reduction in allodynia evoked by light stroking was statistically significant only for alfentanil. Mean reduction +/- SEM relative to placebo were for ongoing pain: ketamine, 36 +/- 9%; alfentanil, 51 +/- 5%; area of pinprick hyperalgesia: ketamine, 34 +/- 7%; alfentanil, 35 +/- 7%; and area of mechanical allodynia: ketamine, 52 +/- 20%; alfentanil, 70 +/- 12%. Because the drugs were given systemically and produced side effects in all subjects, we cannot specify the site or sites of action nor conclusively rule out a non-specific 'active placebo' response as the cause for reduction of symptoms. Arguing against an 'active placebo' response, however, was the lack of analgesic effect of intravenous midazolam (mean dose; 3.4 mg, titrated to produce side effects of similar magnitude to ketamine and alfentanil) given at 145 min after capsaicin in 9 subjects who had received saline from 25 to 60 min. The results of this study suggest that neural systems sensitive to NMDA receptor antagonists and opioids participate in capsaicin-evoked pain phenomena, and support the feasibility of pharmacological studies using the intradermal capsaicin model.",E,E

In this retrospective study fentanyl was evaluated as a second-line subcutaneously infused opioid. Starting doses ranged from 100 to 1000 micrograms/24 h, and the duration of fentanyl infusion was 3-70 days. The clinically derived mean relative potency of fentanyl to morphine infusions was 68:1 (SD +/- 23; range: 15-100), and we now recommend cautious dose conversion at an approximate equivalence of 150-200 micrograms fentanyl for 10 mg morphine in non-opioid naive chronic cancer pain patients. All patients demonstrated an improvement in the adverse effect(s) for which the change in opioid was undertaken. Adequate pain relief was achieved in all but 1 patient with mixed nociceptive and neuropathic pelvic pain for whom an epidural infusion of a local anaesthetic/opioid mixture was required. Fentanyl was changed to the more potent synthetic opioid sufentanil in 2 patients for whom the fentanyl dose necessitated too large a volume for the portable syringe driver in use. The clinically derived sufentanil to fentanyl relative potencies were 24:1 and 16:1, respectively. This achieved good analgesia and maintained the favourable side-effect profile seen with fentanyl. Subcutaneous infusion appears to be a safe and viable route of fentanyl delivery, and provided effective analgesia with a low incidence of adverse effects in this small selected group of patients who were intolerant of subcutaneous morphine. We suggest a trial of subcutaneous fentanyl for selected patients who have intractable adverse effects on morphine, and it is now the second-line infusable opioid in our service. Further prospective evaluation of the role of these two synthetic mu opioid agonists in palliative care practice is warranted, as part of an evolving picture of variation in opioid side-effect profile seen with different drugs within the class.",E,E

Narcotic registers serve to label patients who are suspected of seeking drugs, thus creating anxiety and often distrust in health care professionals treating them. The four Calgary adult EDs have developed a system that will attempt to remove labels associated with some of these patients, insure communication between patients, their family doctors, and ED staff, and facilitate optimal care of the patients' real problems, be they difficult home management of pain, drug dependence or addiction, or other social issues.

This study was performed to evaluate the safety and benefit of a flexible sheath that enables patients to sit at a 60-degree angle while the sheath is in place in the femoral artery. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to receive either flexible or nonflexible sheaths before PTCA. Patients with flexible sheaths were allowed to sit at an angle of 60 degrees after the procedure. Heparin management was the same in both groups. Frequency of calls to nurses for back pain was recorded for both groups. For analgesia, nalbuphine was administered in 2-mg increments. All sheaths were removed the day after the procedure. Femoral ultrasound was used to detect groin complications (hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous fistula) and was performed in all patients. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. There were no differences in ease of sheath insertion or guide catheter movement through the sheaths. The arterial pressure waveform was not dampened in any of the flexible sheath patients while in the sitting position. Patients with flexible sheaths had fewer calls for back pain and required less nalbuphine than patients with nonflexible sheaths. Groin complications were similar in both groups. In conclusion, by allowing patients to sit up to an angle of 60 degrees, flexible sheaths have a beneficial effect in reducing back pain and the need for analgesics after PTCA.",E,E

Previous studies investigating its use have yielded conflicting results and have often suffered from design defects. The theoretical lower incidence of respiratory and circulatory depression with IPA suggests significant advantages over epidural analgesia. Patients who had documented blunt chest wall trauma were entered into a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, crossover, placebo-controlled study within 16 hours of their injury. Patients who were intubated or had significant trauma outside of the chest wall were not entered. Intrapleural catheters were placed using a standardized technique. Each patient received either a placebo solution of normal saline or a combination of bupivacaine/lidocaine in a blinded, crossover fashion for two 24-hour periods. Data were obtained on the use of supplementary narcotics, transcutaneous pCO(2') pulse oximetry, pulmonary function tests, and both patient and nursing evaluations of pain based on a numeric analogue scale. A series of 16 patients from a Level I trauma center were identified over a 2-year period. The ratio of male to female was approximately 2:1, with an age range of 35-80 years. There were no complications related to catheter placement or anesthetic toxicity. Mean values for patient and nursing pain ratings revealed opposite trends. We found no significant difference in the mean values for supplemental narcotic use, pCO(2') p0(2') forced vital capacity, or forced expiratory volume between the placebo and the test solution. Although previous studies have suggested that IPA may be beneficial in the management of chest wall pain, this was not confirmed in our study for blunt chest injuries. The addition of IPA to the more traditional use of opioid analgesics was not more effective for management of blunt chest wall pain. Despite our small patient population (n = 16), the crossover design should have allowed clinically significant differences to become evident (alpha value = 0.95).

A few small studies in patients have suggested that intravenous boluses or rapid infusions of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine relieve some neuropathic pains but also produce disturbances of cognition and mood. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial, we treated eight patients with chronic posttraumatic pain and widespread mechanical allodynia with 2-h intravenous infusions of the NMDA antagonist ketamine (mean dose, 58 mg), the opioid mu-receptor agonist alfentanil (mean dose, 11 mg), and placebo. The patients were selected because extensive sensory testing suggested that altered central processing contributed to their symptoms. The slow rate of drug infusion was chosen to see if pain relief would precede dose-limiting side effects. Means of the peak effect scores achieved during the 2-h infusion were for pain relief: ketamine, 65%, alfentanil, 46%, and placebo, 22% (p < 0.01 for ketamine and p = 0.08 for alfentanil, each compared to placebo); and for relief of allodynia: ketamine, 71%, alfentanil, 57%, and placebo, 21% (p < 0.01 for both ketamine and alfentanil). Appreciable symptomatic relief developed only after the onset of unpleasant drug side effects. After the infusion was stopped, pain relief disappeared before the side effects resolved. We conclude that NMDA antagonists may have promise for the treatment of neuropathic pain, but strategies are needed to improve their therapeutic ratio, such as intrathecal administration or systemic treatment with more selective drugs.",E,E

The patients received routine post-operative care, which included morphine by patient-controlled analgesia, 1 mg per demand with a lockout of 6 min and a background infusion of 1 mg h-1. In addition, pain was assessed at 12 and 24 h using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), both at rest and on coughing. At 24 h, the median VAS at rest was 24 mm (range 0-80) in the pre-emptive group and 28 mm (range 0-100) in the post-surgical group. The average morphine consumption rate over the first 24 h was 1.9 mg h-1 (SD +/- 0.6) in the pre-emptive group, and 2.2 mg hr-1 (SD +/- 1.1) in the post-surgical group. There were no significant differences on univariate testing. Subsidiary stepwise multiple regression modelling identified age, weight, type of hysterectomy, and the timing of ketorolac administration as significant explanators of post-operative morphine consumption. A statistically significant pre-emptive analgesic effect was therefore identifiable, but the clinical significance is uncertain in relation to the other influences on post-operative analgesic requirements.",E,E

Fifty ASA I or II women were allocated randomly to receive either diclofenac 75 mg or ketorolac 30 mg intramuscularly 30-90 min before general anaesthesia. Pain scores were assessed half-hourly in the recovery room and then at 2 h and 4 h in the ward. In the recovery room, pain was treated with a second dose of the study drug, followed by parenteral pethidine if necessary. Four patients in the diclofenac group and five patients in the ketorolac group requested no analgesics after surgery. Fifteen patients from each group had satisfactory analgesia after the second dose of study drug. Pain scores were similar between groups at all times. The median (range) initial pain score in the recovery room was 5 (0-9.5) in the diclofenac group and 5 (1-9) in the ketorolac group. Pain at the injection site was more common after diclofenac than ketorolac (12 vs. 3, P < 0.05). In conclusion, both intramuscular diclofenac and ketorolac were relatively ineffective in controlling the pain after laparoscopic sterilization. The drugs were equally well tolerated, but more patients complained of pain at the injection site after diclofenac.; A comparison of two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ketorolac and diclofenac, indicates both were relatively ineffective for treating pain after laparoscopic sterilization.  NSAIDs produce analgesia by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins.  Patients were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular injections of either 75 mg of diclofenac (n = 25) or 30 mg of ketorolac (n = 25) 30-90 minutes before surgery.  There were no major anesthesia or surgical complications.  The median duration of surgery, time from initial dose of NSAID to arrival in the recovery room, and length of stay in the recovery room were 20, 75, and 60 minutes, respectively, in both groups.  Only 4 women in the diclofenac group and 5 in the ketorolac group did not require further analgesia after surgery, but 60% had adequate analgesia after a second NSAID dose.  Pain scores, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and the requirement for anti-emetics did not differ between groups.  Injection site pain lasted 15-30 minutes after ketorolac compared with 8-12 hours after diclofenac.  While the analgesic potency of ketorolac is about 5 times that of diclofenac, the anti-inflammatory potency of ketorolac is only twice that of diclofenac.",E,E

More than 40% of respondents indicated that analgesic rebound headache was present in at least 20% of their patients. On average, the physicians reported that 73% of patients with analgesic rebound headache were women. Analgesic rebound headache was most likely to occur in patients aged 31 to 40 years. No one analgesic was consistently identified as causative, although acetaminophen, butalbital + aspirin + caffeine, and aspirin were commonly used by patients. Eighty percent of respondents indicated that depression was commonly observed in analgesic rebound headache sufferers; 77% indicated that physical conditions (especially gastrointestinal symptoms) were commonly observed. A variety of therapeutic strategies, including pharmacotherapy, were used in the management of analgesic rebound headache.; Analgesic rebound headache was recognized as a distinct entity and a substantive component in more than 40% of the practices of 174 surveyed practitioners.

Patients selected required one or more periodontal osseous surgeries that were judged to involve relatively similar degrees of surgical manipulation. Patients in the etodolac group received two 300 mg capsules 30 minutes prior to surgery and then redosed themselves prn. Patients who received the combination drug were not premedicated and followed a prn regimen. The subjects used a verbal analogue scale to report levels of pain hourly for the first 8 hours (starting 30 minutes prior to surgery) and also indicated any side effects experienced during the first week after surgery. Specific parameters monitored were the mean sum of hourly pain scores, mean hourly pain scores, time to first medication, number of postoperative doses, and adverse effects. Of the parameters studied, the only one that showed a statistically significant difference was the time to first medication. The time span from 30 minutes prior to the beginning of surgery to the first postsurgical dose was greater for etodolac than for the combination drug. However, the total number of medications taken under both regimens was similar. The side effects were minimal for both of the drugs studied. It was concluded that the analgesic regimens tested under clinical practice conditions were comparable in providing analgesia with minimum side effects in uncomplicated periodontal osseous surgery. Studies with larger numbers of patients are needed to definitively address whether these regimens are truly equivalent.",E,E

All patients had intrathecal lidocaine 5% 1.8 ml preoperatively. Postoperative pain relief was provided with morphine from a Baxter Travenol infusor with PC module. The morphine concentration was 2 mg/ml or 3 mg/ml. In order to reach the analgesic blood concentration as quickly as possible, the patients were instructed to start PCA from the very first moment pain occurred. The patients breathed room air. The nursing staff evaluated respiratory and cardiovascular parameters, pain and side effects. Although mean VAS scores were higher than 3 in the early postoperative phase, no supplementary analgesics were required. One patient had urine retention. One patient had a drop in blood pressure at the start of morphine, which was quickly restored with the administration of colloids. Oxygen saturations were lower (SpO2 < 95%) the first hours postoperatively, especially at the first assessment where no morphine was administered. Pain or relative hypovolaemia could be an explanation. Dry mouth and sleepiness were the most frequently reported side-effects, followed by dizziness, vomiting and nausea. Sweating and itching were less frequently reported. The occurrence of the side effects was the highest during the first postoperative day. We conclude that even when morphine is used in PCA without loading dose or background infusion after opiate-free locoregional analgesia, close monitoring is necessary for at least 5 hours.",E,E

We report on our experience in the treatment of twenty patients, mostly suffering from cancer (18 cases), from 1990 to 1993. It is shown to be an effective, non-destructive method with minimal side effects in the treatment of nociceptive pain. Analgesia takes effect within a few minutes and the necessary doses are low.

Furthermore, there is experimental evidence showing that conscious recall of intraoperative events is only the tip of an iceberg; it seems very probable that there is even a higher incidence of unconscious perception during general anaesthesia. Therefore, the following stages of intraoperative awareness must be distinguished: (1) conscious awareness with explicit recall and with severe pain; (2) conscious awareness with explicit recall but no complaints of pains; (3) conscious awareness without explicit recall and possible implicit recall; (4) subconscious awareness without explicit recall and possible implicit recall; (5) no awareness. The incidence of conscious awareness with explicit recall and severe pain has been estimated at less frequent than 1/3000 general anaesthetics. Conscious awareness with explicit recall but no complaints of pain has been reported in the literature with an incidence of 05-2%. With 7-72%, conscious awareness without explicit recall and possible implicit recall shows a very wide range of variation and its occurrence probably depends on the anaesthetic drugs used. Subconscious awareness with possible implicit recall has an incidence of up to 80%, but there are many methodological problems in demonstrating implicit memory of intraoperative events. Reports of intraoperative awareness do not come exclusively from cardiac surgery and obstetrics, but also from all other operative specialties. Postoperatively, patients who experience intraoperative awareness may develop a so-called post-traumatic stress syndrome. Symptoms involve re-experiencing the event awake or in dreams, sleep disturbances, depression, avoidance of stimuli associated with the event. The probability of the development of the post-traumatic stress syndrome seems to coincide with the experience of severe pain. When a patient complains of intraoperative awareness postoperatively the anaesthesiologist should discuss the event frankly with the patient. When the symptoms of the post-traumatic stress syndrome persist a psychotherapy should follow. Causes for intraoperative awareness may be: equipment failure, too-light anaesthesia, e.g. for a caesarean section or for emergency surgery in severely injured or polytraumatized patients, during cardiac surgery, bronchoscopy of difficult intubation. There is interindividual variability in anaesthetic effect; for example, chronic drug or alcohol abuse or overweight may make increased anaesthetic doses necessary. They are at risk for intraoperative awareness. Some general anaesthetics or anaesthetic procedures, e.g. the combination of a relaxant and N2O, opioid mono-anaesthetics, or opioids combined with benzodiazepines, seem to involve a higher risk of intraoperative awareness than do volatile anaesthetics. The bases of litigation are medical malpractice, breach of contract by the anaesthesiologist or lack of informed consent from the patient. Therefore, patients who are at risk of intraoperative awareness should be given detailed information on this special risk before the operation.",E,E

Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) makes it possible to determine equipotent dosages of analgesics by relating analgesic consumption per time to the levels of analgesia obtained in comparable patient populations. Therefore, we studied the equipotency ratios of clonidine and piritramide and the incidence of undesired side effects in the treatment of postoperative pain in patients undergoing maxillo-facial surgery.; After approval of the local ethics committee and informed consent 40 patients (age > 18 year, ASA I-III) were studied. Following randomization, the patients each received a PCA device containing either clonidine (bolus 30 micrograms), or piritramide (bolus 1.5 mg) for treatment of postoperative pain (lockout interval 5 min in both groups). During the postoperative period, pain was determined using a visual analogue scale, while analgesic consumption, sedation, haemodynamic parameters, respiration rate, and the occurrence of undesired side effects were documented additionally.; The groups had comparable distributions of biometric data, duration of anaesthesia, and ASA classification. Pain level decreased significantly (P < 0.0001) in both groups during the first 2 h of PCA. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were lower (P < 0.05) in the clonidine group 4 and 6 h after PCA onset, while the degree of sedation after 2 (P < 0.01) and 6 (P < 0.05) h was higher than in the piritramide group. Nausea and vomiting were more frequent (P < 0.05) in the piritramide group. Both groups showed a wide interpatient variation in analgesic requirement. The equipotency ratio clonidine/piritramid was 1:63.7.; Intravenous clonidine is a potent analgesic and is suitable or the treatment of postoperative pain following maxillo-facial surgery. The analgesic potency of 150 micrograms clonidine i.v. was equivalent to that of 9.56 mg piritramide i.v. Nausea and vomiting occurred more rarely in the clonidine group, while deeper sedation was observed more frequently than in the piritramide group. Owing to the wide interindividual variation of analgesic consumption, clonidine dosages have to be adjusted to the actual requirements.",E,E

In general treatment is based on drug therapy. The clinical appearance is determined by chronic pain, steatorrhoea and eventually by the onset of diabetes mellitus. Beyond other measures total avoidance of alcohol ingestion provides a condition of a more benign course of the disease. Treatment of pain consists of symptomatic therapy and prescription of pancreatic enzymes in order to lessen pancreatic stimulation by inhibition of feedback mechanisms. The same principle applies to the prescription of octreotide which is used only in selected cases since it has failed to prove general effectiveness. Symptoms of exocrine insufficiency are alleviated by substitution of pancreatic enzymes. Attention must be directed on dose and preparation of pancreatic enzymes being used. Treatment of pancreatogenic diabetes resembles therapy of type I diabetes mellitus. In principle treatment of chronic pancreatitis should be adjusted to the highly variable clinical appearance of the disease and requires a systematic approach.

If analgesia was not demanded within a 15-min period, the computer reduced the target concentration by 5 ng.ml-1. All patients had continuous pulse oximetry monitoring and hourly recording of pain, sedation, nausea scores and respiratory rate. Patients receiving alfentanil had the target concentration noted hourly and four blood samples taken during the first 24 h for measurement of plasma alfentanil concentrations by high performance liquid chromatography. The alfentanil infusion system was equally effective as an analgesic technique when compared with morphine patient-controlled analgesia. There were no hypoxaemic episodes (oxygen saturation < 94%), no difference in sedation scores and the incidence of nausea (30%) was the same in both groups. There was a significantly (p < 0.001) lower respiratory rate in the alfentanil group compared with patients receiving morphine at, clinically assessed, equianalgesia. The predicted plasma alfentanil concentrations increased rapidly from about 30 ng.ml-1 during the first 4 h to around 100 ng.ml-1 at the end of the 24-h study period. The precision of the target-controlled infusion system was 75.4% and the mean prediction error (bias) 58.1%, suggesting an underestimation of the measured alfentanil concentrations by the alfentanil infusion system in these Chinese patients.",E,E

A two-phase protocol was used; phase M, intrathecal morphine alone twice daily; phase M + K, co-administration of ketamine (1.0 mg) with morphine intrathecally twice daily. The dose of morphine was titrated upwards until acceptable pain relief was achieved, defined by numeric rating scales (0-10) < or = 3, and the rescue dose of morphine was less than 5 mg after each intrathecal administration for two days.

Tolerance is a decreasing effect of a drug with prolonged administration of that drug or of a related (e.g., endogenous) compound acting at the same receptor. This is often associated with a downregulation of receptors. In peripheral inflamed tissue, both locally expressed opioid peptides and morphine can produce powerful analgesia mediated by similar populations of opioid receptors. We hypothesized that the chronic presence of endogenous opioids in inflamed joints might convey downregulation of peripheral opioid receptors and tolerance to the analgesic effects of intraarticular morphine. We assessed these effects after arthroscopic surgery in patients with and without histologically verified synovial cellular infiltration, and we examined synovial opioid peptides and opioid receptors by immunocytochemistry and autoradiography, respectively. We found that, despite an abundance of opioid-containing cells in pronounced synovitis, morphine is at least as effective as in patients without such cellular infiltrations, and there is no major downregulation of peripheral opioid receptors. Thus, opioids expressed in inflamed tissue do not produce tolerance to peripheral morphine analgesia. Tolerance may be less pronounced for peripherally than for centrally acting opioids, which provides a promising perspective for the treatment of chronic pain in arthritis and other inflammatory conditions.",E,E

Early lithotripters required prolonged immobility of the patient and caused considerable pain, necessitating general or epidural anaesthesia during the procedure. Modern lithotripters are quicker, but still require analgesia. Intravenous opioids are currently the drugs in favour. The opioids most commonly used are fentanyl and its shorter-acting analogue, alfentanil. The latter has a more rapid onset and, because of its reduced lipid solubility, is less cumulative. Sufentanil is a new opioid that is also of the phenylpiperidone group and has been recently licensed and introduced in Germany. Its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties suggest an intermediate duration of action, high analgesic potency, and cardiovascular stability with diminished respiratory depression. In this prospective double-blind study, the effects of alfentanil and sufentanil on cardiovascular and respiratory parameters, the quality of analgesia, degree of sedation and the number and type of side-effects were compared.; After giving informed consent and with the approval of the hospital ethics committee, 62 patients (ASA I or II) were investigated. They were randomly allocated to two groups, either receiving sufentanil (n = 32) or alfentanil (n = 30) during ESWL. No premedication was given. Excluded were patients with pain prior to treatment, patients treated with a spasmolytic or analgesic drug and those who had undergone ESWL within the last 6 months. The loading dose was given as a 5-min infusion to each group. The heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2), and the transcutaneous capillary carbon dioxide tension (PicCO2) were recorded prior to the procedure (i.e. before administration of opioid), after 1000 and after 2000 shock waves and then 1 and 2 h after the end of lithotripsy. After 1000 and 2000 shock waves, and 1 an 2 h after the treatment, the patients were asked to express their degree of tiredness and pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS). The occurrence of side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus or other unpleasant sensations were noted by an anaesthesia nurse. Simultaneously, the anaesthetist recorded his/her impression of the patient's tiredness and degree of pain, both by using the VAS. He was not allowed to question the patient, nor was he aware of the patient's own scores. At the end of the observation period both the patient and the anaesthetist related their overall satisfaction with the anaesthetic procedure, again by using the VAS. Data were analysed with the Mann-Whitney-U for comparisons between groups and with the Wilcoxon test within each group. The side-effects were analysed with the Chi-square test.; The systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained stable in both groups during and after treatment. The mean heart rate was different between the two groups at the beginning, and after the end of the treatment it dropped in both groups, but no significant difference was seen between groups. The PicCO2 rose from an initial mean of 36.8 mm Hg to a maximum of 44.6 mm Hg after 1000 shock waves in the sufentanil group, and from 37.8 mm Hg to 46.0 mm Hg after 2000 shock waves in the alfentanil group. The differences were significant within groups until 1 h after the end of the treatment, but there was no significant difference between groups. The oxygen saturation SpO2 dropped slightly in both groups. The differences were not significant between groups. In the alfentanil group, one patient had a maximum carbon dioxide tension of 83 mm Hg after 2000 shock waves, whereas in the sufentanil treated group the oxygen saturation fell to 72% in one case.

However, many in other reports did not agree to this result. Therefore, the characteristic of the analgesic effect of intra-articular morphine is worth evaluation. In order to rule out the systemic action of intra-articular morphine, we designed a study to compare the efficacy of 3 mg intra-articular morphine with that of 3 mg intravenous morphine in providing analgesia after arthroscopic knee surgery.; Sixty patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery under spinal anesthesia were randomly divided into two groups (n = 30, each). At the end of surgery, group 1 received 3 mg intra-articular morphine in 15 ml isotonic saline and intravenous isotonic saline 10 ml; group 2 received 15 ml intra-articular isotonic saline and 3 mg intravenous morphine in 10 ml isotonic saline. Postoperative pain was evaluated using visual analogue scale (VAS) during an active or passive flexion of the operated knee joint. Also, additional analgesic consumption requested by patient postoperatively (morphine, 2 mg, iv, each) was recorded.; Pain scores were lower in group 1 than in group 2 from 4 to 36 h postoperatively (Mann-Whitney rank-sum test). Also, the consumption of supplemental analgesic morphine was lower in group 1 than in group 2 from 6 to 36 h postoperatively.; Intra-articular morphine (3 mg) provided long-lasting analgesia from 6 to 36 h postoperatively and this effect was not due to systemic absorption of morphine.",E,E

It is distinguished from established oxicams by a relatively short elimination half-life (3 to 5 hours), which may be advantageous from a tolerability standpoint. Data from preliminary clinical trials suggest that lornoxicam is as effective as the opioid analgesics morphine, pethidine (meperidine) and tramadol in relieving postoperative pain following gynaecological or orthopaedic surgery, and as effective as other NSAIDs after oral surgery. Lornoxicam was also as effective as other NSAIDs in relieving symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, acute sciatica and low back pain. Lornoxicam has a tolerability profile characteristic of an NSAID, with gastrointestinal disturbances being the most common adverse events. Limited clinical experience to date suggests that, as with a number of other NSAIDs, lornoxicam may provide a better-tolerated alternative or adjuvant to opioid analgesics for the management of moderate to severe pain. It has also demonstrated potential as an alternative to other NSAIDs for the management of arthritis and other painful and inflammatory conditions.

This study compared two postoperative oral analgesic protocols after day case inguinal hernia repair; 30 mg morphine sulphate (MST) and 10 mg metoclopramide every 8 h for 48 h or 75 mg diclofenac twice daily for 48 h. The pain reported in the MST group was significantly greater on both the day of operation and the first postoperative day (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). A significantly higher proportion of patients taking MST complained of nausea on the day of operation and on the 1st postoperative day (P < 0.05, chi 2). The time taken to walk, dress and leave home alone were achieved in a significantly shorter duration in patients taking diclofenac. We conclude that diclofenac provides effective analgesia, has a more acceptable side-effect profile than morphine sulphate and is the treatment of choice after ambulatory hernia surgery.",E,E

This study investigated the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a convenience sample of 18 patients disabled by low back pain (LBP) referred to, evaluated, and treated in a comprehensive pain rehabilitation program specifically designed to restore work readiness and return to work. Subjects had one or more spinal conditions, had work-related back pain for more than 6 months (x = 23.8), were Caucasian, predominantly young (x = 37.5) and male (55%), and were disabled on workers' compensation and approved for rehabilitation. The performance of three diagnostic procedures, the Pain Medicine Evaluation, an independent Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID), and Longitudinal Clinical Diagnosis were compared with the ""gold standard"" of the Final Diagnosis which incorporated information from the other three. Also, the performance of a questionnaire, The Pain & Mood Structural Interview (PMSI), designed to assess the causal relationship of pain and mood and specifically the confounding effects of physical factors, was examined. Thirteen of 18 patients (72%) were diagnosed with MDD at Final Diagnosis. MDD diagnosis was made on 4 of 18 patients (22%) on the initial Pain Medicine Evaluation and on 9 of 18 patients (50%) on the SCID, with only 1 ruled out by the confounding questionnaire, for a SCID current prevalence of 44%. Both the SCID and Pain Medicine Evaluation accurately diagnosed the MDD cases they identified; 9 of 13 MDD cases (69%) were precipitated by a physical factor other than their pain.

We questioned whether there might also be a place for their use in conjunction with regional anesthesia and whether there was a preferable route for NSAID administration.; Ilioinguinal and field blocks were performed preoperatively on seventy patients undergoing outpatient inguinal hernia repair. Patients were divided into a control group who received no ketorolac and four study groups who received a preoperative dose of 30 mg ketorolac by one of the following routes: i.v., i.m., p.o., or intrawound (i.w.). The ketorolac in the i.w group was mixed in the syringe with the local anesthetic used for the field block. i.v. and i.m. groups also received ketorolac at the time of the preoperative regional anesthesia and the PO group received the dose at least one hour preoperatively. All patients received a similar general anesthetic intraoperatively.; Postoperative pain scores and analgesic requirements were lowest for the i.m., i.v., and i.w. groups. Pain scores and analgesic requirements for the PO group were less than for the control group but more than for the other three groups. Analgesic efficacy therefore ranked: i.m. = i.v. = i.w. > p.o. > control. Though no differences were found between groups in the time to discharge from the recovery room, the ease of nursing care paralleled the findings for pain scores and analgesia requirements.; Beyond the analgesia provided by the regional anesthesia of the ilioinguinal and field blocks, the preoperative use of ketorolac further reduced postoperative pain scores and the need for additional postoperative analgesic medication. Comparable outcomes for the i.v., i.m. and i.w. groups indicate the lack of any benefit to concentrating the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug at the wound (i.w.) or to achieving high blood levels rapidly (i.v.). In conclusion, ketorolac is a useful supplement to ilioinguinal plus field block regional anesthesia for hernia surgery and is most effective administered parenterally.",E,E

Despite this alarming statistic, little is known about the factors responsible for the transition of acute to chronic pain. The aim of the present study is to identify predictors of long-term post-thoracotomy pain.; Follow-up was for 1.5 years for patients who had participated in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of preemptive, multimodal analgesia.; Subjects were recruited from a tertiary care center.; Thirty patients who had undergone lateral thoracotomy were followed up by telephone, administered a structured interview, and classified according to long-term pain status.; Present pain status was measured by a verbal rating scale (VAS). Measures obtained within the first 48 h after surgery were compared between patients with and without pain 1.5 years later. These include VAS pain scores at rest and after movement, McGill Pain Questionnaire data, patient-controlled morphine consumption (mg), and pain thresholds to pressure applied to a rib contralateral to the thoracotomy incision.; Fifty-two percent of patients reported long-term pain. Early postoperative pain was the only factor that significantly predicted long-term pain. Pain intensity 24 h after surgery, at rest, and after movement was significantly greater among patients who developed long-term pain compared with pain-free patients. A significant predictive relationship was also found at 24 and 48 h using the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Cumulative morphine was comparable for the two groups. Pain thresholds to pressure applied to a rib contralateral to the incision did not differ significantly between the groups.; Aggressive management of early postoperative pain may reduce the likelihood of long-term post-thoracotomy pain.",E,E

However, even among those with intractable lower extremity pain, the outcome results have shown great variability.; The surgical procedure was performed with the patient awake and providing feedback to ensure optimal pain relief from the lead placement. The study group comprised 40 patients, ranging in age from 28 to 86 years. The average symptom duration was 65.4 months, and the average number of prior lumbar spine surgeries was 2.3 (range, 1 to 8). The primary data collection periods were preoperative, 6 weeks after, and 12 and 24 months after surgery.; Statistically significant improvement in isometric lower extremity function was demonstrated 6 weeks after the spinal cord stimulation implantation. In the more painful leg, the performance increased from 457.5 ft-lb-sec to 629.8 ft-lb-sec (P < 0.01). The performance remained significantly improved at the 12- and 24-month follow-ups. Significant improvement was demonstrated on the physical scale of the Sickness Impact Profile at 6 weeks. At 24 months, all three scales (physical, psychological, and other) as well as the total score were significantly improved. Statistically significant decreases in pain, assessed by changes in visual analog scale scores, were noted in the legs, when walking, and in overall lifestyle. The use of narcotic medication decreased at all follow-up periods. At least 66% of the patients who were taking narcotics before spinal cord stimulation were taking reduced amounts or no narcotics 2 years later. At the time of the 24-month follow-up, at least 70% of patients reported that the procedure helped them, and would recommend it to someone with similar symptoms.; Spinal cord stimulation implantation can result in improved physical function and decreased pain in patients who are carefully screened and in whom the implantation is performed with the patient awake to help ensure optimal pain-relieving lead placement.",E,E

Whether its analgesic effects are linked to its mood-altering activity or attributable to a discrete pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown. Clinical trials demonstrate that oral amitriptyline achieves at least a good or moderate response in up to two-thirds of patients with post-herpetic neuralgia and three-quarters of patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, neurogenic pain syndromes that are often unresponsive to narcotic analgesics. Amitriptyline has also demonstrated efficacy in heterogeneous groups of patients with chronic non-malignant pain. Other possible areas of use for amitriptyline are in patients with fibromyalgia or as an adjuvant for uncontrolled cancer pain, although evidence for the latter application is limited. Adverse events resulting from the antimuscarinic activity of amitriptyline (primarily dry mouth and sedation) are commonly reported, even at the low dosages used for the control of pain. Low starting doses and careful dosage titration may help to minimise these effects. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia, sometimes associated with tricyclic antidepressant agents, may also pose a problem in the elderly. In summary, amitriptyline has a valuable place in the treatment of chronic pain conditions that affect the elderly provided that the drug is used judiciously to minimise adverse effects. Importantly, amitriptyline remains the best studied of the antidepressant agents in post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy and is an important and effective treatment option in these syndromes.",E,E

The main efficacy variables analyzed were: pain intensity difference and summed pain intensity differences during the first 3 and 6 h after study drug intake, total pain relief during the first 3 and 6 h, global evaluation score at the end of the observation period, and time to rescue analgesic.; Because of protocol violations, 17 patients were excluded from the analysis of effects.

In patients with strong baseline pain, statistically highly significant differences were documented in efficacy variables between the active drugs and placebo and between the two active drugs. However, in patients with moderate baseline pain, no differences were found between the study drugs in any of the analgesic efficacy variables.; This study thus confirms that codeine has additive analgesic effect to paracetamol in pain after surgery.

This work has demonstrated that the NMDA receptor and PKC translocation are importantly involved in neuropathic pain and morphine tolerance or dependence and that these phenomena may be importantly interrelated. Neuropathic pain following nerve injury is a major chronic pain syndrome. Utilizing a rat model of painful peripheral mononeuropathy produced by CCI of the sciatic nerve, the authors have investigated central mechanisms of postinjury neuropathic pain. Behavioral and pharmacological studies indicate that thermal hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain behaviors observed in this model are attenuated by treatment with NMDA receptor antagonists. A consequence of NMDA receptor activation is calcium influx, which in turn can result in translocation of PKC from cytosol to membrane. Inhibitors of intracellular PKC translocation and activation block thermal hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain behaviors after CCI and also reduce the elevated spinal cord neural activity in CCI rats. Furthermore, spinal cord levels of membrane-bound PKC reliably increase in CCI rats as a result of translocation of PKC revealed by the [3H]PDBu autoradiographic assay. This increase in membrane-bound PKC is associated with postinjury neuropathic pain behaviors in CCI rats and both pain-related behaviors and membrane-bound PKC are reduced potently by GM1 ganglioside.",E,E

Having worked in a tertiary referral pain clinic that serves many low back pain patients who have demonstrated the ineffectiveness of chronic opiate therapy, I am strongly ambivalent about recommending prescribing ongoing opioiod therapy for chronic pain patients. The caveats about prescribing opioids for such patients are most appropriate (i.e., do not prescribe opioids for those who have a history of problems with opioid therapy or for whom increased intake is associated with decreased function); however, for patients who do not display these problems (and there could be many out there), I am sympathetic with the sentiments expressed by Brown et al. A trial of these drugs might be warranted if all else fails and continued therapy with opioids seems justified, but only with zealous attention to monitoring function and therapeutic compliance, as outlined by the authors. With regard to the doses needed for control, the method of opioid administration might be important, that is, whether it is in tablets or in a masking vehicle. In this day of open dialogue, it is not fashionable to blind the patient to the drug or dose, but I believe blinding has a place in the care of a particular group of patients whose symptom (pain) can vary considerably with time. I have found that most chronic pain patients rarely, if ever, reduce their analgesic intake in better times, but an attentive physician can if masking vehicles are used. Thus the physician can limit the amount of drug consumed long term. In my personal experiences with comparable chronic nonmalignant pain patients (albeit in different hemispheres), the average opioid maintenance (methadone) dosage was halved by prescribing the drug in a masking vehicle rather than as a tablet. If pain complaints are reduced and if function is improved according to the record (eg, patient is working) and the relatives' report, and if you, the prescribing physician, are happy, then a long-term regimen of opioid therapy is probably fine. Further controlled trials are needed to see whether this therapy works, and if so, what are the optimal agent(s) and dosages, what is optimal monitoring, and most important of all, who is the optimal patient who might derive not only analgesia but also functional benefit rather than compromise from this therapy. If we cannot make patients better, we must not make them worse.",E,E

To obtain 24 hours of analgesia, group M needed 18.0 mg of morphine, while group F/M needed 4.7 mg of morphine and 1.48 mg of fentanyl. For group M, mean serum concentrations of morphine decreased from 18 ng/mL at 1 hour from the start of treatment to 5 ng/mL at 24 hours. For group F/M, serum morphine stayed at approximately 4 ng/mL, but serum fentanyl increased from 0.28 ng/mL at 5 minutes to about 0.8 ng/mL at 16 hours.; When fentanyl is added continuously to epidural morphine, the resulting higher total serum levels of opioids during prolonged treatment may increase the risk of respiratory depression. Combining the two opioids for the loading dose, however, may be valuable to shorten the onset time of analgesia.",E,E

For this purpose a 29-gauge BD-Quincke spinal needle was used. All subsequent top-ups consisted of 10 mL of the mixture, as used for the patients who received epidural analgesia only.; Thirteen patients delivered without requesting a second injection. The time required to obtain satisfactory analgesia (visual analog score < or = 2.5 and/or > 50% improvement) was significantly shorter for those who received the subarachnoid mixture than for the epidural analgesia group (4.0 +/- 0.4 vs 10.4 +/- 0.5 minutes, respectively, P < .001). The duration of analgesia was longer for the CSE group (137.4 +/- 11.5 vs 106.4 +/- 11.8 minutes, P < .05), with more patients being pain-free for longer than 150 minutes (40 vs 8%, P < .05). Less bupivacaine was consumed in the group receiving the subarachnoid mixture (21.6 +/- 2.0 vs 30.7 +/- 2.1 mg, P < .01). Pruritus was more common following subarachnoid than following epidural injection of sufentanil (53.1 vs 25.8%, P < .05). Other side effects related to the injected drugs, such as motor impairment, hypotension, or nausea or vomiting, were not observed. Although all blocks were uneventful, moderate headache compatible with postdural puncture headache occurred in two patients of the CSE group, which necessitated a blood patch after 5 days.; The CSE mixture induced long-lasting analgesia, with fast onset and without motor block or hypotension. Pruritus and headache were the major drawbacks of this technique.",E,E

The follow-up period was 6 months to 5.7 years (mean 3.4 years +/- 1.3 standard error of the mean). Deafferentation pain and neuropathic pain showed the best long-term results, with 68% and 62% pain reduction (visual analog scale), respectively. The mean morphine dosage initially administered was 2.7 mg/day (range 0.3-12 mg/day); after an average of 3.4 years, it was 4.7 mg/day (range 0.3-12 mg/day). In a long-term observation of 28 patients who received intrathecal morphine for longer than 4 years. 18 patients (64.3%) had a constant dosage history and 10 patients (35.7%) showed an increase in morphine dosage to more than 6 mg/day 1 year after dosage determination. In seven cases, a tolerance developed: in four patients the tolerance was controlled by means of ""drug holidays""; but in three patients it was necessary to remove the pump systems. Explantation of the pump system occurred in 22 additional cases for other reasons. Throughout the follow-up period, 74.2% of the patients profited from the intrathecal opiate therapy: the average pain reduction after 6 months was 67.4% and, as of the last follow-up examination, it was 58.1%. Ninety-two percent of the patients were satisfied with the therapy and 81% reported an improvement in their quality of life.

Severe pain was most common in OST patients. Analgesics, mainly diclofenac (52%) and pethidine (36%), were prescribed by protocol for 93% of patients. Although there were differences among the various services, compliance with diclofenac prescription was better; compliance was high among GO patients for both drugs. Over half the patients reported having had severe or unbearable pain during the hours following surgery. Most said relief was sufficient or high (55%) with treatment and described themselves as satisfied or very satisfied (62%) with the analgesic received. Surgery on extremities was the most painful and generated the greatest dissatisfaction.; This study suggests that type of surgery may condition the prevalence of and severity of postoperative pain. Although type of surgery and location are important factors, there are sufficient differences and deficiencies in treatment to explain, at least partly, the variation observed.",E,E

The purpose of this study was to review the analgesic dose ratios for methadone compared with hydromorphone.; In a retrospective study, 48 cases of medication changes from morphine to hydromorphone, and 65 changes between hydromorphone and methadone were identified. the reason for the change, the analgesic dose, and pain intensity were obtained.; The dose ratios between morphine and hydromorphone and vice versa were found to be 5.33 and 0.28, respectively (similar to expected results). However, the hydromorphone/methadone ratio was found to be 1.14:1 (5 to 10 times higher than expected). Although the dose ratios of hydromorphone/morphine and vice versa did not change according to a previous opioid dose, the hydromorphone/methadone ratio correlated with total opioid dose (correlation coefficient = 0.41 P < 0.001) and was 1.6 (range, 0.3-14.4) in patients receiving more than 330 mg of hydromorphone per day prior to the change, versus 0.95 (range, 0.2-12.3) in patients receiving ae330 mg of hydromorphone per day (P = 0.023).; These results suggest that only partial tolerance develops between methadone and hydromorphone.

A behavioral state score was used to assess the infants' behavior. Cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol levels were measured as physiologic markers of stress. Urinary 3-methyl histidine/creatinine molar ratio was determined and the fractional excretion of urea was measured to assess catabolic state. Ventilatory indexes were recorded for each infant.; Infants receiving fentanyl showed significantly lower behavioral state scores (p < 0.04) and lower heart rates (p < 0.001) than those receiving placebo. 11-Deoxycortisol levels were lower in the fentanyl group on days 3, 4, and 5 of the study (p < 0.003). 3-Methyl histidine/creatinine ratios and fractional excretion of urea were not significantly different between the two groups.

Children used a Face Interval Scale ranging from 1 (no pain) to 9 (maximum pain), and adults used a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 to 10.; One fourth of pediatric and more than half of all adult patients had no reduction in their pain scores on leaving the ED. Eleven percent of adults and fewer than 4% of children received pain treatment while in the ED. Fewer than half of all patients were sent home with analgesics. We observed no use of opioids in the ED for analgesia.; Our data illustrate that both adults and children with severe pain resulting from orthopedic injury in the Costa Rican EDs we studied often receive inadequate or no analgesic treatment.

However, the use of opioids for the treatment of non-cancer pain is still a matter of controversy. The main matters of concern are physical dependence and opioid abuse. Another argument against opioids is the lack of efficacy. Experiences with opioids in non-cancer pain have been published on about 850 patients, the longest therapy lasting almost 14 years. 85% of the patients treated with opioids had beneficial effects. In a number of investigations evaluating the opioid sensibility of pain by PCA and intravenous infusions, 67-80% of the patients with neuropathic pain responded to opioids. The efficacy of opioids in the treatment of non-cancer pain was proven in 3 placebo controlled studies. In 2 studies pain reduction in neuropathic pain was similar to that in nociceptive pain. When opioids are used, the administration has to be performed according to well defined standards. The indication for opioids must be made by a specialist in pain management. The diagnosis must clearly reveal an organic origin of the pain. Before the start of therapy the duration as well as the criteria for discontinuation must be set up. The treatment must be controlled by a specialist team and frequent regular follow up investigations must be performed. These must include proper documentation of the pain level, changes in patients' function and in social activities. The reliable intake of prescribed medication must be assured if necessary by laboratory screening. The treatment of non-cancer pain with opioids may be an alternative for those patients, who didn't gain sufficient reduction of pain by other therapies. Standards for this therapy are an absolute necessity and are to be followed closely.",E,E

Based on positive results of former studies using a continuous infusion of tramadol for postoperative pain relief, we aimed to improve this regimen. In order to investigate the effectiveness of preventive analgesia, one group of patients was given 100 mg tramadol (Tramal) at the time of extubation, followed by a maintenance infusion. The other group was treated with single boluses of tramadol on demand, thus representing common pain treatment. METHODS. 112 patients undergoing abdominal surgery were chosen at random for this double-blind study. Half of them (preventive group) received an injection of 100 mg tramadol at the time of extubation; the others (on-demand group) were given a placebo instead. A continuous infusion of 500 ml NaCl 0.9% (administered with 30 ml/h) followed, either containing 200 mg tramadol (preventive group) or a placebo (on-demand group) and was maintained until the end of the study. At the first expression of pain, patients in the preventive group received 50 mg tramadol (representing the first subsequent injection) whereas patients of the on-demand group were given 100 mg tramadol as a loading dose. For further treatment of pain, the members of both groups received 50 mg tramadol when necessary. The level of pain was assessed by means of VAS (visual analogue scale) every hour and additionally at first expression of pain, and finally by VRS (verbal rating scale) after eight hours at the end of the study. RESULTS. 112 patients were chosen at random. 18 had to be excluded--two treatment failures, twelve violations of the study protocol and four patients of the on-demand group, who did not ask for treatment for pain and therefore did not receive any tramadol. Hence only 94 patients could be statistically evaluated. 50% of the remaining 48 patients in the preventive group needed none or only one subsequent injection of tramadol, the other 50% needed two or more subsequent injections. However the patients in the on-demand group, now 46, split up into 71.7% who where administered up to one subsequent injection and 28.3% who received more than one subsequent injection. The number of patients who asked for treatment for pain twice or more during the study period totalled 50% in the preventive group and 58.7% in the on-demand group. The average interval between extubation and first expression of pain was 106.3 +/- 84.2 min in the preventive group, and 75.0 +/- 22.7 min in the on-demand group. The intensity of pain evaluated by VAS as that time was comparable: 55.6 +/- 22.7 (preventive) versus (63.4 +/- 18.3 (on demand). The pain relief obtained, shown by the VAS-differences between the first expression of pain and following assessment, came up to 27.7 +/- 22.9 in the preventive group and 30.3 +/- 23.4 in the on-demand group within a period of 46.2 +/- 17.2 min (preventive) and 43.7 +/- 17.2 min (on-demand). Retrograde assessment of pain (VRS) showed that 85.5% of the preventive group found pain relief excellent or good and 78.3% of the on-demand group were of the same opinion. Total consumption of tramadol totalled 281.4 +/- 53.6 mg in the preventive group in comparison with 150.0 +/- 53.7 mg in the on-demand group. CONCLUSIONS. Only 28.3% of patients of the on-demand group received more than one subsequent injection of tramadol in comparison with 50% of the preventive group--an unexpected result. However, it has to be considered that the injection of tramadol given at the first expression of pain in the preventive group was counted as the first subsequent injection already. The patients in the preventive group asked, on average, 30 min later for treatment for pain. The subsequent pain relief in both groups was comparable, although the amount of tramadol administered at that time was higher in the on demand group than in the preventive group (100 mg versus 50 mg+ amount given by infusion). These facts show the efficacy of the preventive infus",E,E

There is presently no ideal opioid available for epidural use. Comparative pharmacokinetic data help to select the appropriate epidural opioid. Morphine (provided it is given in small doses and volumes) is very appropriate for epidural pain treatment, especially for longer periods of treatment, due to excellent analgesia and very low systemic morphine concentrations. The faster onset of analgesia with epidural pethidine, alfentanil und fentanyl make these opioids recommendable. However, due to the increased risk of respiratory depression during continuous treatment, these drugs should not be given over extended periods. Epidural administration of methadone, sufentanil und buprenorphine cannot be recommended since the advantages over systemic use do not outweigh the risks. Epidural tramadol may be useful in clinical routine, if opioids are not available and supervision of the patient is not guaranteed, because tramadol is not restricted by law and has a low potential for central depressive effects. The safety of the patients should be paramount. If patients are harmed by inappropriate opioids or dose regimens this will discredit a valuable for treating postoperative pain. Postoperative epidural dosages should be as low as possible and be titrated to the patient's individual needs for analgesia. Epidural morphine treatment is an alternative to step 4 of the WHO treatment regimen for patients with intractable pain or those suffering from systemic opioid side effects. Careful selection of patients helps to increase successful treatment. If implantable devices (ports or pumps, according to the life expectancy) are employed, the intrathecal route of administration is preferable to the epidural route, as the latter has a 10 times higher morphine dose requirement.",E,E

A questionnaire was sent out to a 10% random sample of Danish physicians. Of these 1411 physicians, 1068 (76%) returned the questionnaires and after exclusion of those doctors who never treated cancer patients, 577 (54%) were analyzed. Their knowledge of the principles and practice of cancer pain treatment was evaluated by means of 14 multiple-choice and open questions. Their ability to apply their knowledge in practice was evaluated by analyzing their suggested treatment of 3 simulated patient cases. The results show that a vast majority (97%) of the physicians were prepared to use opioids conventionally administered for severe pain and that 39% reported the use of other treatment modalities (psychological treatment, antineoplastic therapy, transcutaneous nerve stimulation/acupuncture, etc.). Ninety-seven percent of the physicians recognized difficulties in cancer pain treatment, the most frequent being side effects of drugs and inadequate pain relief. Seventy-five percent considered that their knowledge about pain treatment was fair or better. The overall evaluation of the proposals for pain treatment of the patient cases was primarily based on drug therapy. Adequate doses, correct dose intervals and selection of drugs, routes of administration and other treatments were the requirements for satisfactory answers. It appears that the majority the physicians could treat both pain from bone metastasis (75%) and visceral pain (78%) satisfactorily, while very few suggested co-analgesics for neuropathic pain conditions (20%). Older physicians performed less well than their younger colleagues. Basic pain treatment skills have been acquired by the Danish physicians but, in the future, emphasis should be placed on the treatment of neuropathic pain with co-analgesics and the management of opioid side effects.",E,E

Patients with a 'stable and low level of cancer pain' receiving a constant dosage of sustained release morphine during a pre-study phase of 6 days were included in the study. Initial fentanyl dosage was calculated by a conversion table. The transdermal system was changed every 72 h and the dosage was adjusted to the needs of the patients according to the VAS scores and the requirement of liquid morphine, which was allowed to achieve sufficient pain relief. Regression analysis at the end of the study revealed a mean morphine/transdermal fentanyl ratio of 70:1. Pain relief during treatment with transdermal fentanyl was identical to sustained release morphine. However, significantly more patients took supplemental medication with liquid morphine during transdermal fentanyl therapy. The number of patients suffering from pain attacks did not increase with transdermal fentanyl. Constipation and medication with laxatives decreased significantly during fentanyl therapy. Other side effects and vital signs were identical. Three patients suffered from a morphine withdrawal syndrome beginning within the first 24 h of transdermal fentanyl therapy. Cutaneous reactions to the patch were rare, mild and transient. Patients and physicians reported satisfaction with the transdermal therapy. 94.7% of the patients chose to continue the transdermal fentanyl therapy at the end of the study due to better performance in comparison to oral morphine. Due to these results an initial conversion from oral morphine to transdermal fentanyl with the ratio of 100:1 is safe and effective.",E,E

The criteria were morphine consumption, visual analogue pain scale (VAS), performance status (PS) determined by medical and nursing staffs, and answers to QOL questionnaires. Morphine consumption, VAS, PS, and self-assessed QOL scores were taken when the administration of morphine was necessary for pain relief and those scores were used as control. Morphine consumption and the VAS score were recorded at regular weekly intervals and the PS and QOL scores were measured every 2 weeks thereafter. CPB was performed within 2-3 days after the control measurement. The VAS scores of the patients receiving CPB (n = 10) were statistically lower for the first 4 weeks after the procedure than those of the patients receiving the standard NSAID-morphine treatment (n = 11) during the same time period after the control measurement. Morphine consumption was significantly lower in weeks 4-7 (inclusive) following the procedure in the CPB group and continued to be lower thereafter, though not significantly so. Although the PS score slightly improved at the 2nd week after CPB, it was not improved by the start of the NSAID-morphine treatment. Self-assessed QOL scores did not ameliorate statistically after CPB; however, they did deteriorate remarkably in the patients treated only with morphine-NSAID during their survival periods, while they deteriorated only slightly in the CPB group. There were fewer side effects after CPB. These results indicate CPB does not directly improve QOL in patients with pancreatic cancer pain, but it may prevent deterioration in QOL by the long-lasting analgesic effect, limitation of side effects and the reduction of morphine consumption, compared to treatment only with NSAID-morphine.",E,E

Naloxone doses were calculated as a percentage of the morphine dose each patient was receiving. Seventeen patients entered the first phase of the study, which had a randomised, double-blind design. Outcome measures were small bowel transit time (SBTT) measured by the lactulose/hydrogen breath test, pain scores and the occurrence of adverse events. One subject was excluded before receiving naloxone. No significant difference between placebo and naloxone occurred in the 14 remaining patients receiving total daily doses of naloxone 10% or less of the 24 h dose of morphine. Two further patients experienced a marked laxative effect with naloxone at 20% of the 24 h dose of morphine. In one of these, SBTT was available and was unchanged from placebo. The other declined to continue with SBTT measurement. Phase two of the study had an open design, in which laxative effects were determined clinically. Naloxone at a maximum dose level of 20% was given to seven patients, up to 40% to two patients and up to 80% to one patient. Four out of the seven patients in the 20% dose level group, and all of the remainder, experienced laxative effects. Two patients experienced symptoms of opioid withdrawal, one of whom also had return of pain. It is concluded that oral naloxone at a daily dose of 20% or more of the prevailing 24 h morphine dose is a potentially valuable therapy for opioid-related constipation. However, opioid withdrawal was observed and it is suggested that initial individual naloxone doses should not exceed 5 mg. Further research is needed into the oral absorption of naloxone, as well as further studies of clinical efficacy and dosing.",E,E

In humans, the central analgesic effect of tramadol 100 mg orally is only partially reversed by the opioid antagonist naloxone (0.8 mg intravenously). As suggested by in vitro and animal data tramadol analgesia may thus result from an action on opioid as well as monoaminergic pathways. We therefore investigated the effect of alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonism with yohimbine on tramadol analgesia. 2. Healthy volunteers (n = 10) received tramadol (100 mg orally), followed (+3 h) by yohimbine (0.1 mg kg-1 intravenously), and yohimbine + naloxone (0.8 mg intravenously) and their respective placebo according to a randomized, double-blind crossover, placebo (P) controlled design. Analgesia was assessed over 8 h by subjective pain threshold (pain intensity numerical scale--PINS) and objective pain threshold (RIII nociceptive reflex--RIII) monitoring. 3. Tramadol induced a significant increase in both pain thresholds. Peak analgesic effect was observed at 3.7 h (RIII + 39.6 +/- 3.9% and PINS 50.1 +/- s.e.mean 5%) and the analgesia lasted about 6 h. 4. Yohimbine significantly reversed the analgesic effects of tramadol for 2.8 h with a maximum decrease of 97 +/- 4% (RIII) and 67 +/- 12% (PINS), whereas the addition of naloxone abolished tramadol effects throughout the study period with a decrease of 90 +/- 6% (RIII) and 79 +/- 9% (PINS), P < 0.05). 5. Yohimbine alone did not significantly reduce pain thresholds. 6. alpha 2-Adrenoceptor antagonism reverses tramadol effects, thus pointing to the significant role of monoaminergic modulation and the synergy with opioid agonism in tramadol antinociception after a single oral dose.",E,E

Two hundred and twenty-six of the 366 ambulatory AIDS patients surveyed reported ""persistent or frequent"" pain over the 2 week period prior to the survey. Adequacy of analgesic therapy was assessed using the Pain Management Index (PMI - a measure derived from the Brief Pain Inventory) and the type and frequency of analgesic medications prescribed for pain. Results indicated that nearly 85% of patients were classified as receiving inadequate analgesic therapy based on the PMI. Less that 8% of the 110 patients who reported ""severe"" pain were prescribed a ""strong"" opioid (e.g., morphine), as suggested by published guidelines. Adjuvant analgesic drugs (e.g., antidepressant medications) were prescribed in only 10% of the patients. Women, less educated patients, and patients who reported injection drug use as their HIV transmission risk factor were most likely to have received inadequate analgesic therapy.

Patients were assigned in a random blind manner to receive 1 microgram/kg of sufentanil 5 min before induction of anaesthesia (group A, n = 18) or after ligation of the round ligaments of the uterus (group B, n = 21). General anaesthesia was induced with midazolam, thiopental and vecuronium and maintained with isoflurane and N2O in oxygen. Propoxyphene and paracetamol, or pethidine for overnight or if pain was uncontrollable, were prescribed on request. Pain was assessed with VAS and a verbal rating scale (VRS: 1 = no pain and 6 = intolerable pain) immediately before the first analgesic administration and 4, 8, 12, and 24 h postoperatively. VAS or VRS scores did not differ between the two groups at any time: neither did propoxyphene, paracetamol, and pethidine requirements. These results suggest that preinjury i.v. sufentanil is not more beneficial for postoperative pain control than the postinjury administration.",E,E

The patients had spinal anesthesia with 1.5-2.0 mL hyperbaric 5% lidocaine. At conclusion of herniotomy morphine 5 mg was injected incisionally in 10 patients, intravenously in 10, and subcutaneously in 10.

Assessments were made immediately before and at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours after herniotomy and on the second and seventh postoperative days. At the same times morphine and acetaminophen consumptions were recorded.; There were no significant differences in postoperative visual analog scores between the groups. Except for the cumulative morphine requirement from the second to the seventh postoperative day, which was significantly higher in the placebo group than in other groups, no significant differences in cumulative morphine and acetaminophen requirements were found between the groups.; A single 5-mg dose of morphine injected in the herniotomy wound did not affect pain scores or supplementary analgesic requirements, which argues against a role of peripheral opioid receptors in mediating analgesia.",E,E

The aim of this study was to investigate the analgesic effect and its duration of a new sustained-release preparation of tramadol in an experimental pain model based on pain-related chemosomatosensory evoked potentials (CSSEPs) and subjective intensity estimates of painful phasic and tonic stimuli. 2. Twenty volunteers participated in a randomised, double-blind, three-fold cross-over study. Measurements were obtained before and 0.5, 1, 4, 6, and 12 h after administration of the drug (100 mg, 200 mg and placebo orally). CSSEPs were recorded after stimulation of one nostril with phasic, painful CO2 pulses. The other nostril was stimulated with a constant stream of dry air, which produced a tonic painful sensation. Subjects rated the perceived intensity of phasic and tonic stimuli via visual analogue scales. In order to test for nonspecific effects, acoustic evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded, the spontaneous EEG was analysed in the frequency domain, the subject's vigilance was assessed in a tracking task, and the side effects of the drug were monitored. 3. The sustained-release preparation of tramadol produced a significant dose-related decrease in CSSEP amplitudes when compared with placebo. The reduction in amplitudes outlasted the observation period of 12 h, demonstrating the prolonged duration of the analgesic effect. 4. A dose-related significant decrease could be observed for the estimates of tonic pain. Similar to the decrease of amplitudes of the CSSEP, the reduction of the ratings of tonic pain outlasted the observation period of 12 h. The observed slight decrease in the estimates of phasic pain under medication did not reach a statistically significant level when compared with placebo. No significant effect could be demonstrated for the perception of the phasic and the tonic pain as determined by the McGill-Questionnaire. 5.

The participants, 182 inpatients experiencing moderate to severe pain after abdominal or gynecologic surgery, provided hourly ratings of pain intensity and relief for 12 hours after administration. All active treatments were significantly superior to placebo for many hourly measurements and for the sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) and total pain relief (TOTPAR). A dose response was found among the three levels of CR oxycodone for pain relief and peak pain intensity difference (PID), with the 20- and 30-mg doses being significantly better than the 10-mg dose. For all active treatments, peak PID and peak pain relief occurred approximately 2 to 4 hours after administration. The median time to onset of relief was 32 minutes for oxycodone plus APAP, 41 minutes for IR oxycodone, and 46 minutes for CR oxycodone 30 mg. Duration of pain relief showed that the 10-, 20-, and 30-mg doses of CR oxycodone had durations of action of 10 to 12 hours compared with IR oxycodone and oxycodone plus APAP (both approximately 7 hours).

Patches were analyzed for the remaining fentanyl contents using the Coat-A-Count Fentanyl radioimmunoassay. Five 2.5-mg patches and four 10.0-mg patches were opened, solubilized with methanol, diluted with water, and analyzed in duplicate. An unused 2.5-mg patch also was analyzed as a control and showed a 94% recovery of fentanyl. A methanol blank was negative for fentanyl.; The study determined the amount of fentanyl in milligrams remaining in a used patch. Using pharmacokinetics principles, this quantity was compared with a potential lethal dose of fentanyl.; Analysis showed 0.7-1.22 mg remaining in the 2.5-mg patches and 4.46-8.44 mg remaining in the 10.0-mg patches. These numbers represent 28-84.4% of the original contents. Using the pharmacokinetic values of the volume of distribution of 4L/kg and a potential lethal blood concentration of 3.7 micrograms/L, one can calculate the potential lethal dose for a 70-kg person to be 1036 micrograms. This is well within the amount remaining in the patch. This study also demonstrated that a wide patient variability exists in the absorption of fentanyl from the patch.; There is a sufficient amount of fentanyl available for abuse and misuse after 3 days of therapeutic use.

For clinical purposes, opioids can be classified according to their receptor interactions (agonist, partial agonist, agonist-antagonist and antagonist), the pain intensity for which they are conventionally used (moderate or severe), and their half-life (short or long). Pure agonists conventionally used for moderate pain, short and long half-life pure agonists conventionally used for severe pain, mixed agonist-antagonists and partial agonist opioids are described in detail. The effective clinical use of opioid drugs requires familiarity with drug selection, routes of administration, dosage guidelines and potential adverse effects. Opioids are unequivocally indicated in the management of severe acute pain and moderate to severe pain associated with cancer. There is increasing acceptance of the role of opioids in the management of recurring acute pain, chronic nonmalignant pain of organic origin and severe neuropathic pain. The selection of opioids is influenced by pain intensity, pharmacokinetic and formulary considerations, previous adverse effects and the presence of coexisting disease. Some patients will require sequential trials of several different opioids before a drug which is effective and well tolerated is identified. Opioid agents should be administered by the most comfortable and convenient route that meets the specific needs of the patient. The regimen for opioid medications should generally provide around-the-clock analgesia with provision for rescue doses for the management of exacerbations of the pain not covered by the regular dosage. At all times, uncontrolled pain should be addressed by gradual increase in the opioid dose until either pain control is achieved or intolerable and unmanageable adverse effects supervene. The management of pain with opioid analgesics demands frequent patient assessment and a readiness to re-evaluate the therapeutic plan in the setting of either inadequate relief or adverse effects.",E,E

If pain recurred on the contralateral side, the patient underwent contralateral SPL.; Fifteen patients underwent SPL. Eleven patients required daily narcotics for relief of pain before operation. Eight patients had unilateral SPL, whereas seven ultimately had a bilateral operation (median follow-up, 18 months). Fourteen patients had constant pain before operation, which decreased to a mean of 2.8 attacks per month (p < 0.0001).

It has been used as an analgesic for postoperative or chronic pain since the late 1970s, and became one of the most popular analgesics of its class in Germany. International interest has been renewed during the past few years, when it was discovered that tramadol not only acts on opioid receptors, but also inhibits serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake. This review aims to provide a risk-benefit assessment of tramadol in the management of acute and chronic pain syndromes. Tramadol has been used intraoperatively as part of balanced anaesthesia. Such use is under discussion, however, as it was associated with a high incidence of intraoperative recall and dreaming, and postoperative respiratory depression has been described after intraoperative administration of high doses. Postoperatively, intravenous and intramuscular tramadol has been used with good efficacy. Analgesic doses were comparable with pethidine (meperidine) and 10 times higher than morphine. Nausea and vomiting were the most frequently reported adverse effects. In controlled studies, haemodynamic and respiratory parameters were only minimally impaired. The risk of severe respiratory depression in typical dosages is negligible in comparison with other opioids used for postoperative pain management. Tramadol has been used with good results for the management of labour pain without respiratory depression of the neonate. It was also effective for the treatment of pain from myocardial ischaemia, ureteric colic and acute trauma. Good results have been published for cancer pain management with tramadol in several studies. The potential for abuse or addiction seems to be minimal, and serious complications have not been reported. For patients with severe pain, the efficacy of morphine is superior, and most patients with adequate analgesia from tramadol had to be changed to a more potent opioid after a few weeks due to increased nociceptive input during tumour progression. Tramadol can be recommended as a safe and efficient drug for step II according to the World Health Organization guidelines for cancer pain management.",E,E

DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/OUTCOME MEASURES: From a population of 2,003 chronic pain patients (CPPs) who bought a TENS device for pain management, 506 patients were randomly selected and interviewed by telephone long enough after purchase to allow at least 6 months of TENS use. The interview process used a structured ""skip"" questionnaire designed to assess the CPPs' perceptions regarding the effectiveness of TENS for a variety of outcome variables. Of the 506 CPPs interviewed, 376 (74.3%) had used their TENS device for 6 months or longer and were defined as long-term users. The responses of this group of CPPs to the telephone questionnaire were then subjected to statistical analysis.; Paired t-tests, correlated z-tests, SS Wilks, and chi-square tests demonstrated statistically significant change or improvement (p < 0.05) that paralleled the introduction of TENS use in the following outcome variables: less pain interference with work, home, and social activities; increased activity level and pain management; decreased use of other therapies (e.g., physical therapy, occupational therapy, chiropractic); decreased use of narcotics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids.; The results suggest that TENS is associated with improvement on multiple outcome variables in addition to pain relief for CPPs who are long-term users.

No significant differences in the incidence of side effects between groups were found with the exception of more pruritus reported in the group given morphine. Patients who experienced vomiting or pruritus reported a greater intensity of these side effects if receiving morphine and fentanyl than if receiving pethidine. The majority of patients reported being very satisfied with their postoperative pain management and with PCA, with no differences in satisfaction between the 3 opioid-treated groups. A senior consultant anaesthetist, when asked to make a judgement, was not able to identify which agent each patient was receiving with a better than chance accuracy.

Thus, we wanted to compare the clinical efficacy of wound infiltration with local anaesthesia before surgery with wound infiltration after hernioplasty in children.; Fifty children aged 2-10 years scheduled for hernioplasty were randomly assigned into two groups. Group 1 (n = 28) was infiltrated before surgery with bupivacaine 2.5mg/ml, 1mg/kg after induction of general anaesthesia. After surgery they were infiltrated with the same volume of 0.9% saline. Group 2 (n = 22) was infiltrated with 0.9% saline before surgery and bupivacaine 2.5 mg/ml, 1mg/kg after surgery. The study was performed double-blindly. In both groups anaesthesia was induced with thiopenthone and maintained with nitrous oxide and halothane, adjusted to keep haemodynamic measurements stable. All children were given paracetamol 15-20 mg/kg rectally when admitted to the recovery ward. Painscore (OPS) and analgesic requirements were registered postoperatively. After 48 h the parents completed a standardised questionnaire and they were interviewed by telephone after one week.; The pre-incisional group needed significantly less halothane during the procedure compared with the post-incisional group (P < 0.05). The pre-incisional group also had a tendency towards faster awakening after the end of anaesthesia and a significantly lower OPS-pain score 30 min after the operation (P < 0.03). There were no differences between the two groups regarding need for additional analgesia: meperidine i.v. during the first 5 h postoperatively, and paracetamol thereafter. There were no differences between the groups regarding activity level, appetite and quality of sleep in the first week. In both groups the need for opioid analgesics was low: 54% in the pre-incisional group and 45% in the post-incisional group did not receive any opioid analgesic treatment. The children were virtually fully recovered after the first 24 h.; Perioperative infiltration with a local anaesthetic in children undergoing hernioplasty results in a smooth recovery with little need for opioids postoperatively. Apart from a lower anaesthetic requirement and a reduced postoperative pain level after 30 min in the pre-incisional bupivacaine group, there was no difference between infiltration before (pre-emptive) or after surgery.",E,E

The forty patients in each study were randomly divided into four groups depending on the dosage; Group I (control), Group II (80 micrograms. kg-1 morphine), Group III (4 micrograms. kg-1 buprenorphine), Group IV (8 micrograms. kg-1 buprenorphine). The MAC of halothane was measured following epidural administration of the agents in each group. The duration of analgesia was assessed by the first request for pentazocine. Postoperative analgesic effects were assessed by the total dosage of pentazocine required for the 48 hr after surgery. Respiratory rate (RR), minute volume (MV), and PaCO2 were measured during surgery and the postoperative period. The MAC of halothane was reduced in Group IV (P < 0.01). The duration of analgesia was 10.0 +/- 5.1 hr (Mean +/- SE) in Group I, 37.7 +/- 4.7 hr in Group II, 27.1 +/- 7.1 hr in Group III, and 44.4 +/- 4.1 hr in Group IV. Total dosage of pentazocine was lower in Group IV (P < 0.05) than in the other groups. The decrease of RR, MV and the increase of PaCO2 were observed within 60 min in Group III and IV dose dependently.; Epidural buprenorphine administered in a dose of 4 or 8 micrograms. kg-1 provides postoperative analgesia that is no less effective than that of morphine.",E,E

The investigation employed an experimental pain model based on chemo-somatosensory event-related potentials (CSSERP) in response to painful chemical stimuli applied to the nasal mucosa.; Twenty healthy volunteers participated in the experiments, which followed a controlled, randomised, double-blind, 3-way cross-over design. Each of the three medications (tramadol 100 mg [T100], tramadol controlled release 100 mg [TCR100] and tramadol controlled release 150 mg [TCR150]) was administered orally to fasting subjects. There was at least a 6 day washout period between tests. Each experiment was divided into five sessions, which took place before and 2, 4, 6, and 12 h after drug administration. In addition to the assessment of CSSERP, subjects rated the intensity of both the tonic and phasic painful stimuli. Nonspecific drug effects were also monitored by means of frequency analysis of the spontaneous EEG, ratings of adverse effects, and the subjects' performance in a tracking task.; The significant reduction of amplitude N1 at central recording positions indicated that TCR 150 was the most effective analgesic 12 h after administration. Both 6 and 12 h after administration TCR 100 was more effective in terms of analgesia compared to T100. In addition, TCR100 appeared to produce fewer adverse effects than the standard formulation of tramadol.; The controlled release formulation can be expected to become a valuable tool in peroral therapeutic regimens for chronic pain.",E,E

Thirty seconds before induction of anaesthesia and immediately after a tourniquet at 50 mm Hg greater than systolic pressure was inflated on the upper arm, patients were given either placebo (n = 22), alfentanil 1 mg (n = 22) or lignocaine 40 mg (n = 22) via an i.v. cannula in the dorsum of the hand. Pain during injection of propofol was assessed using a three-point verbal rating scale, recorded at 8-s intervals. We found a significant reduction in pain after lignocaine compared with the two other groups (P < 0.001), but there was no difference between the placebo and alfentanil groups. We conclude that alfentanil does not relieve pain on injection with propofol via an action on peripheral opioid receptors when alfentanil is limited to the forearm for 30 s before induction of anaesthesia.",E,E

Morphine consumption in the midazolam group was significantly lower in the first 12 h postoperatively (p < 0.02) but there was no significant difference between the two groups thereafter. Patients in the midazolam treated group had lower pain scores over the first 24 h. Also, a significantly greater number of patients in the midazolam group required no antiemetic medication over the 48 h study period (p < 0.05). Assessment of sedation revealed no significant difference between groups. We conclude that low dose midazolam has a significant, but short-lived, morphine sparing effect.",E,E

The quality of analgesia was assessed using visual analogue scores and the incidence of nausea, vomiting and itching were recorded during the first 24 h postoperatively. There was no statistically significant difference in the quality of analgesia nor in the incidence and severity of itching between the two groups. Fewer patients in the 0.1 mg morphine group experienced postoperative nausea and vomiting (7 versus 14, p < 0.05). We conclude that the use of 0.1 mg morphine intrathecally produces comparable analgesia to 0.2 mg after Caesarean section with significantly less nausea and vomiting.",E,E

There has been little change with regard to this obligation of all caregivers. One-third of patients with advanced cancer will develop clinically relevant skeletal metastases and chronic pain during the course of their disease. All physicians involved in the treatment of cancer patients should know the basic principles of pain treatment. These are described in the following article with special regard to bone pain of malignant origin. Correct assessment of pain intensity and frequency, as well as of the probable causes of pain, and the administration of adequate analgesic treatment should achieve satisfactory results in the vast majority of patients. Every physician should obtain detailed knowledge of the indications and adequate administration of pain-killing therapy as well as possible adverse effects and their successful treatment. It is important in particular to concentrate on a few nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as well as opiates. Knowledge of adequate doses, maximal recommended daily doses, pharmacological properties, important adverse effects and interactions is essential for success in the daily routine. Only by selecting 2 or 3 drugs from each step in the analgesic ladder (WHO) will the nonspecialised physician obtain sufficient experience for optimal analgesia. Physicians should also not hesitate to contact other specialists (medical oncologists, radiotherapists, neurosurgeons, anaesthesiologists and others) in order to maximise benefit for an individual patient.",E,E

Headaches (55% of patients) and chest pain (65%) were frequently reported, although back pain (19%), abdominal pain (19%), and limb pain (16%) were also reported. In patients with headache, the main etiologies were hypercarbia or hypoxia, migraine, and sinusitis. The majority of chest pain was musculoskeletal, with pleuritis, pneumothorax, and rib fracture also reported as the cause of chest pain.; A variety of nonpharmacological and pharmacological therapies were reported. Forty-one patients (53%) had pain severe enough to require opioid treatment, and 10 patients (13%) received opioids for more than 3 months. In eight patients with more severe pain, regional analgesia was found to be particularly effective.; Chronic pain is a common problem in CF, particularly as the patient population ages. When administered with caution, opioids have proven to be effective and safe in this population; regional anesthesia can be used to preserve pulmonary toilet while adequately treating severe pain.",I,E

Forty patients (mean age 39 years, range 22-51 years) suffering from CLBP (mean pain duration 5.9 years, range 1-12 years) participated. Three pharmacological approaches were used: (1) intravenous infusion of morphine, (2) intravenous infusion of lidocaine and (3) a diagnostic epidural opioid blockade. The patients were tested in a single-blind, placebo-controlled fashion. The pain was considered nociceptive if it decreased by 50% or more in response to both intravenous morphine and epidural fentanyl, but increased in response to intravenous naloxone. The pain was considered neuropathic if it decreased by 50% or more in response to both intravenous lidocaine and the epidural local anaesthetic. Patients who registered a pain decrease of 50% or more in response to saline were classified as placebo responders. Those who registered less than 50% pain decrease in all the tests were considered nonresponders. According to the results of the tests, 16 of the patients were classified as having nociceptive pain, 8 neuropathic pain, 2 were placebo responders, 10 non-responders and 4 were unclassified. The results support the idea that this battery of pharmacological tests can be used in the classification of CLBP patients into different pain categories. This approach may prove useful as a guide for further patient evaluation and as a basis for choice of a suitable treatment strategy.",E,E

Buprenorphine biovailability by the sublingual and buccal routes was estimated as 51.4% and 27.8%, respectively, although there was considerable interindividual variability by both routes of administration. The terminal elimination half-lives were longer for the sublingual and buccal routes than for the intravenous route. The extended elimination half-lives may be due to a shallow depot effect involving sequestration of buprenorphine in the oral mucosa. Norbuprenorphine mean peak plasma concentrations were less than 1 ng/mL and were highly variable among different routes of administration and individuals.

Measures were related to the individual levomethadone plasma levels. Under steady-state conditions, the pain perception of the patients did not differ from a drug-free placebo control group and was not related to individual levomethadone plasma levels, although an analgesic effect in the reabsorption phase was observed. It is concluded that the individual pain perception of maintained patients is adapted to a normal response range and that even prolonged opioid consumption does not diminish dynamic analgesic responsiveness to levomethadone.",I,E

The goal of treatment was to relieve the pain, which was resistant to opioid drugs, and to optimize the quality of life that remained, estimated to be only a few weeks.; The first patient received a continuous brachial plexus block via an epidural catheter, introduced by means of a Tuohy needle and a peripheral nerve stimulator to locate the plexus accurately. The second patient required catheterization of both the sciatic and femoral nerves, again with a peripheral nerve stimulator used to locate the nerves prior to inserting the catheters.; Analgesia was established with a bolus of local anesthetic and maintained with a continuous infusion of local anesthetic in the first patient. For the second patient, fentanyl was added to the local anesthetic, as it had been shown to improve analgesia in the lower limb in previous work. In the first patient, the analgesia allowed active treatment of the lymphedema and mobilization of the limb, and she remained pain free until her death 2 weeks later. In the second patient, the infusions controlled the pain both before and after surgical amputation of the limb, until the stump was well healed.; Peripheral nerve catheterization proved beneficial in two patients who presented with difficult pain management problems and should be more widely considered for the relief of severe cancer-related pain in both the upper and lower limbs.",E,E

Forty-one patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were randomly allocated to four groups. Two groups received epidural morphine, 4 mg immediately after operation and 3 mg ten hours later, and two groups the same volume of saline. All patients had access to intravenous PCA-fentanyl. One epidural morphine and one epidural saline group (PreEpiMo and PreMo, respectively) received morphine, 0.14 mg/kg i.m. as premedication. Pain was measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS). Respiration was monitored by means of pulseoximetry, arterial blood gas analysis and rate of breathing. Morphine premedication reduced postoperative pain in the immediate postoperative period in patients with epidural placebo (PreMo), but the effect was absent in patients with PreEpiMo. Epidural morphine (EpiMo) provided stable analgesia with reduced need of PCA-fentanyl. Two patients (10%) (one in EpiMo and one in PreEpiMo) developed respiratory depression requiring naloxone treatment. The dosage of epidural morphine used in this study was a likely explanation of this depression. Nausea, vomiting, itching and urinary retention were the most frequent side effects without significant differences between the groups. In conclusion, morphine premedication had a temporary rest effect on the postoperative pain. Epidural morphine provides a better analgesia than intravenous PCA-fentanyl.",E,E

As most studies have used a model of intraarticular instillation of narcotic we examined direct morphine infiltration of the surgical site in a unique clinical model.; Sixty patients undergoing primary rhinoplasty were entered into this prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Patients received a standard protocol of premedication, intravenous sedation, and nasal block. Two 2 ml syringes containing saline or morphine 3 mg in saline were provided for IM injection and for addition to the local anesthetic (IW, intrawound): Group I (control)-saline IW, saline IM; Group II morphine IW, saline IM; Group III-saline IW, morphine IM. Intraoperative assessments included need for further sedation, need for further local anesthetic, and degree of bleeding. Recovery room analgesic requirements, pain scores, and recall of intraoperative pain were recorded prior to discharge. Followup phone calls at 24 hours recorded home pain scores and analgesic use during the first postoperative day.; Significantly more patients in Group II (9/20) required supplemental local anesthetic intraoperatively compared to Group I (2/20) and Group III (0/20). Significantly more patients in Group II (6/20) recalled their surgical experience as painful compared to Group I (1/20) and Group III (1/20). Group II patients also evidenced significantly more operative bleeding. There were no differences in postoperative pain scores, but Group I patients required analgesic in the recovery room significantly more than in Groups II and III (85% vs 45% and 50%, respectively). There were no differences between groups in analgesic consumption at home.; The results of this study indicate that the preoperative injection of intrawound morphine in combination with the local anesthetic both promotes bleeding and has an early pain-enhancing effect while providing no late analgesic benefit beyond that of IM morphine.",E,E

No opioids nor local anaesthetic blocks were used during surgery. The patients received either 30 mg ketorolac IV before surgery followed by a placebo injection after surgery or the reverse. Postoperative pain intensity was assessed repeatedly for 6 h using a visual analogue scale. No differences in pain intensity were observed between the two groups except for the initial 15-min postoperative assessments in the ketorolac group. The time to first rescue morphine administration and the total morphine consumption during the 6-h observation period were similar. It is concluded that the preoperative administration of ketorolac did not provide a significant preemptive analgesic benefit with regard to postoperative pain relief and opioid dose-sparing effect.,E,E
8911798,Pharmacology and clinical experience with tramadol in osteoarthritis.,"Analgesics, Opioid; Drug Interactions; Humans; Osteoarthritis; Tramadol","Katz, W A","Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic that has been shown to be effective in a variety of acute and chronic pain states. Unlike other centrally acting analgesics, it exerts a dual action by binding to the opioid receptor site in the central nervous system and by weakly inhibiting the reuptake of biogenic amines. Tramadol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed, with an onset of action occurring within 1 hour of oral administration. The recommended dosage is 50 to 100 mg every 4 to 6 hours; however, regular administration is an alternative, particularly for chronic pain states such as osteoarthritis, where the use of the recently developed sustained release formulation may represent an important advantage. Published studies specifically evaluating the use of tramadol in this disease support its effectiveness. Nausea, drowsiness, constipation, dizziness, and sweating have been reported in association with tramadol use. Nausea occurs early in the course of administration, and may be reduced by slowly titrating the dose of tramadol against response. Tramadol would appear to be particularly useful in the elderly population affected by osteoarthritis because, unlike nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, it does not aggravate hypertension or congestive heart failure, nor does it have the potential to cause peptic ulcer disease. Compared with narcotics, tramadol does not induce significant respiratory depression, constipation, or have significant abuse potential.",E,E

The hypothesis was that a long-acting anesthetic agent would result in patients experiencing less pain in the 24-hour postoperative period and therefore needing fewer oral analgesics. We randomized 100 patients undergoing ESS to receive either lidocaine (1% or 2%) with epinephrine or bupivacaine (0.25% or 0.5%) with epinephrine as an anesthetic and for a sphenopalatine block. Postoperative pain was assessed with a standard numeric pain assessment scale at baseline and at 2, 6, and 24 hours after surgery. The use of analgesics during this period was also documented. We compared the results between patients receiving bupivacaine and those receiving lidocaine, as well as between patients who required nasal packing and those who did not. We discovered that in general, pain after ESS was less severe than expected. We further found that the type of anesthetic used did not significantly affect postoperative pain; pain score changes and use of analgesics were similar between the two anesthesia groups. Postoperative pain was also similar between the ""packing"" and ""no packing"" groups. Although patients receiving packing had consistently lower increases in pain (and in fact many patients in this group had decreases in pain from baseline), none of the differences between group means was statistically significant.",E,E

In this study we tested morphine effect on the skin blood flow response to pain more systematically. Skin blood flow was measured using a laser Doppler technique during 19 percutaneous central venous catheter placements in 18 infants, 10 of whom received intravenous morphine premedication. The mean +/- SD baseline skin blood flow was similar between the two groups: 22.5 +/- 9.5 ml 100 g-1 min-1 in the morphine group, and 23.7 +/- 8.0 ml 100 g-1 min-1 in the no-morphine group, respectively (p = n.s.). During PCVC placement in the morphine treated group, skin blood flow remained low with minimal variability. The mean value was 22.6 +/- 7.7 ml 100 g-1 min-1 (p = n.s. compared to baseline). In 7/9 infants not treated with morphine skin blood flow increased dramatically during PCVC placement, while in two it did not. But the mean skin blood flow in this group of 9 infants during PCVC placement was 45.3 +/- 34 ml 100 g-1 min-1, an overall change of 97% increase from the baseline. This was statistically significant compared with the baseline and the morphine group value during PCVC insertion (p < 0.04). During the 45 min time period after PCVC placement, skin blood flow values between groups again were similar. We conclude that morphine pretreatment for PCVC placement minimizes pain-associated increases in skin blood flow. The issue of whether skin blood flow changes could serve as measures of adequate analgesia needs to be evaluated with further studies.",E,E

A clinical protocol for calculating the PCA commencement opioid dose and subsequent opioid-dose escalation was tested by measures of safety and efficacy. Measures of pain intensity and opioid side effects were made during the three periods. On the last study day (day 10), patients received a continuous infusion of opioid derived from the previous 24-hour PCA opioid requirement, and blood specimens were collected and stored for subsequent opioid analysis.; Ten patients were enrolled in this study. Rapid escalation in opioid requirement commonly occurred at the commencement of PCA, followed by a variable plateau phase and then deescalation of opioid requirement after mucositis resolution. The measures demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the clinical protocol. In the concentrations used, there was no statistical difference between the mean daily pain, sedation, nausea and vomiting, and pruritus scores for both opioids (Friedman test). The analysis of variance of the log-total opioid doses per patient during periods 1, 2, and 3 indicated that patients used 27% more hydromorphone than expected from its presumed 7:1 ratio relative to morphine potency used in the PCA infusions. The mean plasma hydromorphone concentration was 4.7 ng/ml (range, 1.9 to 8.9 ng/ml), and the mean clearance was 51.7 ml/min per kilogram of body weight (range, 28.6 to 98.2 ml/min per kilogram). The mean plasma morphine, morphine-6-glucuronide, and morphine-3-glucuronide concentrations were 40.0 ng/ml (range, 15 to 62.5), 168.2 ng/ml (range, 54.4 to 231.9), and 391.0 ng/ml (range, 149.4 to 921.7), respectively. The mean morphine clearance was 34.3 ml/min per kilogram of body weight (range, 19.3 to 58.3). The mean molar ratios of morphine-6-glucuronide/morphine, morphine-3-glucoronide/morphine, and morphine-3-glucuronide/morphine-6-glucuronide were 2.48 (range, 1.4 to 3.3), 5.82 (range, 3.4 to 9.1), and 2.46 (range, 1.1 to 3.3), respectively.; The safety and efficacy of a clinical protocol for the administration of opioids by means of PCA for mucositis pain after bone marrow transplantation was demonstrated. In this small study, hydromorphone was not superior to morphine in terms of analgesia or the side-effect profile: a larger study would be needed to show a difference. The clearances of hydromorphone and morphine in the children studied were generally greater than those previously recorded, but this finding may be related to disease or treatment variables. Apart from clearance, the morphine pharmacokinetics in the study population were similar to those previously recorded. Hydromorphone may be less potent in this population of children than indicated by adult equipotency tables.",E,E

However, in many countries i.v.-PCA is rarely used. Recent clinical studies demonstrated that intranasal fentanyl titration provides a rapid and safe form and pain management. In the present study we investigated patients' acceptance and assessment of patient-controlled intranasal analgesia (PCINA) and compared it to intravenous PCA and the customarily prescribed pain therapy.; After approval by the local ethics committee and written informed consent, 79 ASA physical status I or II patients were investigated on the first postoperative day following orthopaedic surgery. The patients were allocated either to the PCINA group (a maximum of 0.025 mg fentanyl over 6 min), to the i.v.-PCA group (0.025 mg fentanyl bolus, lockout interval 6 min) or to a group of patients who received the customarily prescribed pain management. Following the 8-h investigation period, the patients were questioned regarding their satisfaction with the pain therapy using a 6-point rating scale (ranging from 1 = very good to 6 = not acceptable). The patients were furthermore asked to name the advantages and disadvantages of their pain management.; Three patients in the i.v.-PCA group had to be excluded due to pain at the injection site and one patient in the PCINA group because of a surgical complication. Seventy-five patients were finally included, 25 patients per group. No statistically significant intergroup differences regarding age, weight, height and initial pain intensity (evaluated by a 101-point numeric rating scale) were demonstrated. The patients' satisfaction with the mode of pain management was significantly higher in the PCINA (median ""good"") and in the i.v.-PCA group (median ""good"") than in the group who received the customarily prescribed pain management (median ""satisfactory""). This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.0001). No statistically significant difference was demonstrated between the PCINA and i.v.-PCA groups. The patients in the PCINA and in the i.v.-PCA group stated as main advantages the rapid onset of action and good pain relief (n = 25 and n = 25, respectively), as well as their independence from the doctor or nurse (n = 12 and n = 13). The main disadvantages were pain on injection in the i.v.-PCA group and too frequent fentanyl administrations in the PCINA group (n = 6).; The results demonstrate that the patients' satisfaction with PCINA is comparable to that with i.v.-PCA. Both PCINA and i.v.-PCA were assessed as superior to the customarily prescribed pain management (P = 0.0001). Patients' acceptance of a given form of pain management is mainly related to its efficiency. However, side effects such as pain on injection with i.v.-PCA, or frequent opioid administration with PCINA, must be considered when assessing a method of pain control. Patients' global assessment includes both efficiency and side effects. PCINA represents an interesting alternative non-invasive method for postoperative pain management.",E,E

The project's purpose was to adapt the guideline into action plans for participating hospitals and provide the tools necessary to address six ""core"" guidelines-to assess and relieve pain, educate the patient/family and health care workers, measure patient satisfaction, and provide a continuum of care postdischarge. GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT: The guidelines were further adapted to meet the needs of the individual hospitals and were implemented in January 1995. Baseline data was collected on 10 patient records per hospital.; Survey results confirmed that although attitudes about cancer pain management were changing, more needed to be done to prevent patient suffering. Follow-up data after one year showed significantly more compliance on all six core guidelines.; The oncology nurse manager and the hematology/oncology physician chief at one hospital joined the project team to support their own ongoing efforts to implement the guidelines. At that hospital, patient satisfaction with pain management has since increased from the 60%-80% level to at least 90%. STATEWIDE PROJECT EXPANSION: Statewide expansion was planned in fall 1995 to extend implementation to the remaining acute care hospitals and to other health care settings in Utah and to ease a patient's transition from one setting to another.; The project team continues to monitor progress in guideline implementation. Surveys demonstrate that, at the time of diagnosis, up to 45% of cancer patients experience moderate to severe pain; 65%-90% experience severe pain when cancer reaches the advanced stages. Unrelieved cancer pain can cause intense suffering, diminished activity, loss of appetite, and loss of sleep.",E,E

Eighteen patients received codeine phosphate 60 mg and 18 morphine sulphate 10 mg, both by intramuscular injection; 4 patients (10%) required no analgesia. Both drugs provided analgesia within 20 min of injection but morphine was more effective than codeine beyond 60 min (p = 0.01). Fewer doses of morphine than codeine were required (p = 0.003). Nine patients requested one dose of morphine and 9 two doses. Seven patients required three doses of codeine and 1 patient required four doses. Neither drug caused respiratory depression, sedation, pupillary constriction or unwanted cardiovascular effects.

This randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial compared the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of intramuscular (IM) injections of lornoxicam (4, 8, 16 and 20 mg) with morphine (10 and 20 mg) and placebo in 252 patients with mainly moderate to severe pain following surgical removal of an impacted mandibular third molar. Patients treated with lornoxicam or morphine experienced a significantly greater cumulative pain relief over the 4-h post-injection period (TOTPAR0-4) than placebo recipients. This effect appeared to be dose-dependent, with patients in the lornoxicam 4 mg or morphine 10 mg groups recording significantly lower TOTPAR0-4 scores than patients in the higher dosage groups of these drugs. No significant difference was detected between the morphine 20 mg group and the lornoxicam 8, 16 and 20 mg groups. Lornoxicam was well tolerated at all doses and was associated with a significantly lower incidence of adverse events than morphine 10 or 20 mg. Thus, the analgesic efficacy of IM lornoxicam at doses > or = 4 mg is superior to placebo, and doses > or = 8 mg are at least as effective as IM morphine 20 mg. Furthermore, lornoxicam possesses a more favourable tolerability profile than morphine and thus represents an attractive alternative for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain.",E,E

This study was designed to use performance-based testing to evaluate the skills of resident physicians in assessing and managing the severe chronic pain of a cancer patient. Thirty-three resident physicians (PGY 1-6) were presented with the same standardized severe cancer pain patient and asked to complete a detailed pain assessment. The residents then completed questions related to management of the cancer pain patient. In the cancer pain assessment, residents did well in assessing pain onset (70%), temporal pattern of pain (64%), and pain location (73%). However, only 33% and 45% physicians adequately assessed the pain description and pain intensity, respectively, and assessment of pain-relieving factors, previous pain history, and psychosocial history was done poorly or not at all by 70%, 88%, and 94% of residents. Only 58% of the residents were judged to be competent in this clinical cancer pain assessment. In the cancer pain management section, opioid analgesic therapy was prescribed by 98% of residents, and 91% used the oral route. However, only 18% of prescriptions were for regular use and 88% of residents did not provide analgesics for breakthrough pain. A significant number of graduated physicians were judged to be not competent in the assessment and management of the severe pain of a standardized cancer patient. Opioids and NSAIDs were the analgesics of choice; however, most were prescribed on a PRN basis only. Co-analgesics were rarely prescribed. Few physicians managed persistent, severe cancer pain according to the WHO guideline of increasing the opioid dose. The lack of significant difference in scores between junior and senior residents suggest that adequate cancer pain management is not being effectively taught in postgraduate training programs.",E,E

Postoperative pain was assessed and analgesia provided, using a modified infant pain scale. Monitoring included continuous ECG, pulse oximetry, impedance and nasal thermistor pneumography. The CO2 response curves and serum morphine concentrations were measured postoperatively.; Postoperative analgesia was provided within five minutes by all treatment methods. Epidural groups required fewer morphine doses (3.8 +/- 0.8 for low dose [LE], 3.5 +/- 0.8 for high dose epidural [HE] vs. 6.7 +/- 1.6 for iv, P < 0.05) and less total morphine (0.11 +/- 0.04 mg.kg-1 for LE, 0.16 +/- 0.04 for HE vs 0.67 +/- 0.34 for iv, P < 0.05) on POD1. Dose changes were necessary in all groups for satisfactory pain scores. Pruritus, apnoea, and haemoglobin desaturation occurred in all groups.

This study evaluated the analgesic efficacy of epidurally coadministered ketamine and morphine in postoperative pain control.; The patient population consisted of ASA class I and II patients undergoing major joint replacement. Epidural lidocaine was used as the primary anesthesia for the surgery. In phase I of the study, either ketamine (10-30 mg) or morphine (0.5-2 mg) was administered via epidural catheter immediately after surgery. This was done to evaluate the dose-response effect of these drugs when used for postoperative pain relief, and the results were applied to phase II of the study, in which all patients received ketamine pretreatment (total 30 mg) with each dose of lidocaine administered before and during surgery. Forty patients were randomly divided into four groups, each of which received one of three different pain control regimens mixed with 10 ml of saline: group B received 10 mg ketamine, group C 2 mg morphine, and group D 10 mg ketamine plus 0.5 mg morphine while the control group A received 10 mL of saline with no additive. The intensity of pain expressed by patients, as well as the number of intramuscular meperidine (1 mg/kg) injections administered and any side effects that may have occurred, were recorded.; Ketamine produced no significant pain relief. A 2-mg morphine dose did produce significant analgesia but was accompanied by a high incidence of side effects. Co-administration of subanalgesic doses of ketamine, 10 mg and morphine, 0.5 mg, however, also produced a strong analgesic effect.; Ketamine, although not itself an epidural analgesic agent, potentiates the analgesic effect of morphine, especially when administered as a pretreatment. The resulting lowered dosage of epidural morphine needed for postoperative pain relief reduces, in turn, the incidence of side effects. Pretreatment of patients with ketamine epidurally, followed by injections of combined morphine and ketamine could be a promising new analgesic regimen.",E,E

The aim of the present study is to use available data from published trials to compare ICV with the more common epidural (EP) and subarachnoid (SA) opioid treatments in an attempt to establish the utility and safety of ICV.; Because there are no published controlled trials comparing these routes of administration, the combined data from multiple uncontrolled trials were used, with differences between the treatments analyzed statistically. Trials assessing ICV (13 trials, 268 patients). EPI (29 trials, 909 patients) and SA (21 trials, 410 patients) in cancer patients were identified; data on analgesic efficacy, common pharmacologic side effects, and complications were then extracted and the accumulated incidence data analyzed.; The findings (weighted means) indicated ICV to be at least as effective against pain as other neuraxial treatments, with 75% of ICV-treated patients obtaining excellent pain relief as compared with 72% of EPI- and 58% of SA-treated patients (not significant). The failure rate of both spinal treatments tended to be greater than that of ICV and was significantly higher in the case of EPI (P = .045). In general, persistent side effects appeared to be more of a problem with the spinal treatments, while transient symptoms occur more often with ICV. Persistent nausea, urinary retention, and pruritus all were more frequent with the two spinal treatments than with ICV, but transient nausea and respiratory depression occurred more often with ICV. Sedation and confusion appeared to occur more often with ICV than with spinal therapy, while constipation and headache were rarely encountered with ICV. There were no real differences in infectious complication rates among the three treatments (except for a lower rate of infection when an implanted pump was used), but technical problems such as catheter blockage, misplacement, or leakage tended to occur less often with ICV.; Intracerebroventricular therapy appears to be at least as effective against pain as other neuraxial treatments. The ICV technique is the only fixed system that is associated with fewer technical problems than the use of simple percutaneous epidural catheters (difference 9%, standard error of the difference 3.4). The present state of evidence indicates that ICV is a successful treatment for patients with intractable cancer pain and compares well with spinal opioid treatments in terms of efficacy, side effects, and complications.",E,E

The other PCA settings (Bard I PCA pump) were a lock out of interval of 10 min and a 1 h limit of 20 micrograms sufentanil and 30 micrograms clonidine i.e. 10 mL. The parameters measured were the analgesic drug consumption and number of dose demands during the first 24 h, pain scores at 6 h intervals, side effects and quality of sleep. The concurrent infusion increased the dose requirements regardless of the content of the syringe. Consumption of sufentanil was the highest in those patients receiving the plain solution with a basal infusion. Clonidine addition reduced the dose requirements but only significantly in those receiving the background infusion. Patients treated with the mixture tended to reach lower pain scores than those receiving sufentanil only without basal rate. Patients receiving the mixture with basal rate requested significantly fewer additional demands compared with the three other groups, but this did not influence the quality of sleep.

Patients with OAA/S scores of 1 to 3 (""light"" sedation) 5 min after the study medication experienced a greater incidence of intraoperative pruritus and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) compared with those with OAA/S scores of 4 to 5 (""deep"" sedation). Discharge times were prolonged for patients in the light sedation group in whom PONV developed.; Use of remifentanil alone for MAC did not provide optimal sedation during local anesthesia. However, 0.05 to 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 remifentanil in combination with 2 mg midazolam given intravenously, provided effective sedation and analgesia during MAC in healthy patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists status 1 to 2. Midazolam also produced dose-dependent potentiation of remifentanil's depressant effect on respiratory rate. In outpatients receiving a combination of midazolam and remifentanil during local anesthesia, the level of sedation appears to influence the incidence of both intraoperative pruritus and PONV.",E,E

Objective measures were medication use and return to work. Subjective measures included self-reports of pain levels and completion of a Personal Concerns and Goals Assessment (PCGA) examining issues of lifestyle and emotional well-being. These measures were compared at program onset and completion by using appropriate statistical analyses.; Objective measures: Medication use by the study subjects decreased overall by 72% within all drug categories. Opioid use was eliminated. Regarding return to work, the study subjects increased their work hours by twofold overall. Of patients working fewer than 30 h per week at program onset, representing 62% of the study population, a fivefold return to work was observed. Subjective measures: Overall pain levels improved by 33%, with an 18 to 47% improvement in all descriptors (average pain levels on good or bad days, average number of good or bad days). Of the PCGA factors, patients improved 24 to 46% in all categories concerning lifestyle and emotional well-being. Correlative analysis of the data produced prognostic information as well as insights into chronic pain development.; This study of objective and subjective outcome measures demonstrates that a comprehensive program employing specific principles and methods produces an effective approach for the management of chronic pain.

Oxycodone is a strong opioid agonist that is currently available in immediate-release (IR) formulations for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. Recently, controlled-release (CR) oxycodone tablets were developed to provide the benefits of twice-a-day dosing to patients treated with oxycodone. The purpose of this investigation was to develop and validate a pharmacokinetic model for CR oxycodone tablets in comparison with IR oxycodone solution. 2. Twenty-four normal male volunteers were enrolled in a single-dose, randomized, analytically blinded, two-way crossover study designed to compare the pharmacokinetics of two 10 mg CR oxycodone tablets with 20 mg IR oxycodone oral solution. Pharmacokinetic models describing the oxycodone plasma concentration vs time profiles of CR tablets and IR solution were derived using NONMEM version IV. The predictive performance of the models was assessed by comparison of predicted oxycodone plasma concentrations with actual oxycodone plasma concentrations observed in a separate group of 21 volunteers who received repeated doses of IR and CR oxycodone for 4 days. 3. The unit impulse disposition function of oxycodone was best described by a one-compartment model. Absorption rate of the IR solution was best described by a mono-exponential model with a lag time, whereas absorption rate of the CR tablet was best described using a bi-exponential model. The absorption profile of the CR tablets was characterized by a rapid absorption component (t1/2abs = 37 min) accounting for 38% of the available dose and a slow absorption phase (t1/2abs = 6.2 h) accounting for 62% of the available dose. Two 10 mg tablets of oral CR oxycodone hydrochloride were 102.7% bioavailable relative to 20 mg of IR oxycodone hydrochloride oral solution. The population model derived after administration of a single dose accurately predicted both the mean and range of oxycodone concentrations observed during 4 days of repeated dosing. The mean prediction error was 2.7% with a coefficient of variation of 54%. 4. The absorption characteristics of CR oxycodone tablets should allow effective plasma concentrations of oxycodone to be reached quickly and for effective concentrations to be maintained for a longer period after dosing compared with the IR oral solution. The CR dosage form has pharmacokinetic characteristics that permit 12 hourly dosing.",E,E

In the rest cases we observed the longest postoperative pain-free period, the least intensity of pain, and low need in additional analgesics during the first 24 h postoperation in comparison with the control groups (p < 0.05), in which one or several of the above components were excluded from the protocol of anesthesia. Preventive analgesia reduced the incidence of phantom pain syndrome after limb amputation in patients with the preamputation pain from 63.3 to 25.1%. The postoperative pain syndrome may be prevented if the factors determining it (preoperative pain, intraoperative nociceptive stimulation, and perioperative tissue inflammation) are eliminated simultaneously.",E,E

Patients treated migraines with their usual therapy for 12 to 18 weeks followed by subcutaneous sumatriptan for 6 months. Health-related quality of life measurements obtained at baseline, after usual therapy, and after sumatriptan therapy included the Short Form-36 Health Survey and the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire. Patient daily diaries were used to capture data on migraine symptoms and on Lost Workplace Productivity and Non-workplace Activity Time. Traditional clinical efficacy measures were obtained to support the pharmacoeconomic data. Clinical data showed that the percentage of treated migraine days per patient on which the patient experienced relief (moderate or severe pain reduced to mild or none) was 75% with sumatriptan and 25% with usual therapy. The mean time to meaningful relief was 1.1 hours during the sumatriptan phase and 4.2 hours during the usual therapy phase. Lost Workplace Productivity and Nonworkplace Activity Time was 35% lower with sumatriptan therapy (1.5 hours) compared with usual therapy (2.3 hours).

Scores on each of the three Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire dimensions and on the Role-Emotional dimension of the Short Form-36 were significantly more favorable after sumatriptan than after usual therapy (P < 0.05). These data demonstrate that treatment of migraines with sumatriptan for 6 months following usual therapy for 12 to 18 weeks was associated with improvement in clinical efficacy, reduction in lost workplace productivity and nonworkplace activity time, and enhancement of key dimensions of health-related quality of life among employees of a large university hospital.",E,E

Respiratory events were recorded. An observational pain score and saliva for cortisol concentration were obtained 2, 8, and 24 hours after beginning treatment to compare efficacy of pain control. In the second phase, 20 additional patients received fentanyl by continuous infusion in an unblinded fashion, with the same data collection, to more accurately determine the incidence of respiratory events.; In phase 1, apnea occurred in eight of nine B patients (89%) compared with one of seven C patients (14%; P < .009), prompting termination of the randomized trial. The incidence of apnea or significant respiratory depression in the next 20 patients (phase 2) who received fentanyl by continuous infusion was 25% (5 of 20; P < .01 v B). Episodes of apnea in B patients required significantly more intervention than episodes in C patients (P < .01). However, in phase 2, more patients remained intubated and ventilated than in phase 1. Pain scores and salivary cortisol concentrations decreased over the 24-hour study period and were similar in B and C patients during both phases of the study.; Continuous infusion of fentanyl at the doses studied is associated with pain control similar to that with bolus dosing at regular intervals. Although episodes of respiratory depression were less severe and less frequent for C patients, there may be an increased need for ventilator support with continuous infusion of fentanyl to achieve acceptable pain control. Providing adequate pain control to neonates in the immediate postoperative period remains a challenge.",E,E

9010652,Transdermal fentanyl. A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy in pain control.,"Analgesics, Opioid; Fentanyl; Humans; Pain","Jeal, W; Benfield, P","Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid with short-acting analgesic activity after intravenous or subcutaneous administration. The low molecular weight, high potency and lipid solubility of fentanyl make it suitable for delivery via the transdermal therapeutic system (TTS). These systems are designed to release the drug into the skin at a constant rate ranging from 25 to 100 micrograms/h, multiple systems can be applied to achieve higher delivery rates. Initially, much of the clinical experience with fentanyl TTS was obtained in patients with acute postoperative pain. However, because of the increased risk of respiratory complications, fentanyl TTS is contraindicated in this setting. Fentanyl TTS is recommended for use in chronic cancer pain. Moreover, in 11 countries worldwide including the US, its use is not restricted to chronic cancer pain; the drug is also available for treatment of general chronic pain, including that of nonmalignant origin. At the start of fentanyl TTS treatment, depot accumulation of the drug within skin tissue results in a significant delay (17 to 48 hours) before maximum plasma concentration is achieved. Approximately half of the cancer patients converted to transdermal fentanyl from other opioid agents required increased dosages after initial application of the patch. However, concomitant use of short-acting morphine maintained pain relief during the titration period, and the use of such supplementary medication decreased with the duration of fentanyl TTS treatment. In patients with chronic cancer pain, changes in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores ranged from a 10% increase (worse pain) to > 50% decrease (less pain) during transdermal fentanyl therapy compared with previous opioid treatment. In addition, patient preference for fentanyl TTS was indicated by the number of patient requests (up to 95%) for continued use of the drug at the end of the study. Although fentanyl TTS is contraindicated in patients postoperatively, the efficacy of fentanyl via the transdermal route was investigated in this patient group. Supplementary patient controlled analgesia was significantly reduced in patients who received fentanyl TTS 75 micrograms/h compared with placebo, although this was not apparent until > or = 12 hours after application. Data evaluating pain relief, which was assessed by VAS pain scores, were inconclusive. Preliminary data, although from relatively small numbers of patients, indicate that transdermal fentanyl may be useful in the management of chronic non-malignant pain. Indeed, some patients whose pain was previously uncontrolled became completely pain free. The most frequently occurring adverse events during fentanyl TTS therapy (as with other opioid agents) included vomiting, nausea and constipation, although vomiting and nausea were not clearly associated with the drug. The most serious adverse event was hypoventilation, which occurred more frequently in postoperative (4%) than in cancer patients (2%). In surgical patients, fentanyl-associated respiratory events (reduced respiratory rate and apnoea) generally occurred within 24 hours of patch application; however, there were isolated reports of late onset (> or = 36 hours postsurgery) fentanyl-associated respiratory depression. In cancer patients, the incidence of constipation was reduced by up to two-thirds after switching from oral morphine to transdermal fentanyl. Transient skin irritation associated with the plastic patch or the adhesive, rather than the drug, was reported in a maximum 3% of patients. In summary, transdermal fentanyl is a useful alternative to other opioid agents, which are also recommended on the third step of the WHO analgesic ladder, in the management of chronic malignant pain. Preliminary data indicate that it may be useful in the management of chronic nonmalignant pain. The advantages offered by fentanyl TTS over traditional methods of chronic pain control include its ease of administration, less constipation and the 3-",3,E
9010653,Ketorolac. A reappraisal of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use in pain management.,"Analgesics, Non-Narcotic; Humans; Ketorolac; Pain; Tolmetin","Gillis, J C; Brogden, R N","Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with strong analgesic activity. The analgesic efficacy of ketorolac has been extensively evaluated in the postoperative setting, in both hospital inpatients and outpatients, and in patients with various other acute pain states. After major abdominal, orthopaedic or gynaecological surgery or ambulatory laparoscopic or gynaecological procedures, ketorolac provides relief from mild to severe pain in the majority of patients and has similar analgesic efficacy to that of standard dosages of morphine and pethidine (meperidine) as well as less frequently used opioids and other NSAIDs. The analgesic effect of ketorolac may be slightly delayed but often persists for longer than that of opioids. Combined therapy with ketorolac and an opioid results in a 25 to 50% reduction in opioid requirements, and in some patients this is accompanied by a concomitant decrease in opioid-induced adverse events, more rapid return to normal gastrointestinal function and shorter stay in hospital. In children undergoing myringotomy, hernia repair, tonsillectomy, or other surgery associated with mild to moderate pain, ketorolac provides comparable analgesia to morphine, pethidine or paracetamol (acetaminophen). In the emergency department, ketorolac attenuates moderate to severe pain in patients with renal colic, migraine headache, musculoskeletal pain or sickle cell crisis and is usually as effective as frequently used opioids, such as morphine and pethidine, and other NSAIDs and analgesics. Subcutaneous administration of ketorolac reduces pain in patients with cancer and seems particularly beneficial in pain resulting from bone metastases. The acquisition cost of ketorolac is greater than that of morphine or pethidine; however, in a small number of studies, the higher cost of ketorolac was offset when treatment with ketorolac resulted in a reduced hospital stay compared with alternative opioid therapy. The tolerability profile of ketorolac parallels that of other NSAIDs; most clinically important adverse events affect the gastrointestinal tract and/or renal or haematological function. The incidence of serious or fatal adverse events reported with ketorolac has decreased since revision of dosage guidelines. Results from a large retrospective postmarketing surveillance study in more than 20,000 patients demonstrated that the overall risk of gastrointestinal or operative site bleeding related to parenteral ketorolac therapy was only slightly higher than with opioids. However, the risk increased markedly when high dosages were used for more than 5 days, especially in the elderly. Acute renal failure may occur after treatment with ketorolac but is usually reversible on drug discontinuation. In common with other NSAIDs, ketorolac has also been implicated in allergic or hypersensitivity reactions. In summary, ketorolac is a strong analgesic with a tolerability profile which resembles that of other NSAIDs. When used in accordance with current dosage guidelines, this drug provides a useful alternative, or adjuvant, to opioids in patients with moderate to severe pain.",E,E

Adverse effects were rated by a structured interview.; After morphine, morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide were present in equal amounts in plasma of PMs and EMs. After codeine, neither morphine nor morphine-6-glucuronide could be detected in 13 of the 14 PMs, whereas at least one of the compounds could be detected in all EMs. Peak pain and discomfort rated on a VAS scale during the cold pressor test were significantly reduced by morphine in both EMs and PMs, with a median peak change of 8.5 and 7.0 mm, respectively, for peak pain, and 11.5 and 15.5 mm, respectively, for discomfort. Codeine only reduced these pain measures significantly in EMs, with a median peak change of 5.5 mm for peak pain and 10.5 mm for discomfort. Pain detection and tolerance thresholds to heat and pressure were not consistently altered by either morphine or codeine. In PMs, adverse effects were significantly more pronounced on morphine than on codeine and only showed a slight difference between codeine and placebo. In EMs, there was no difference between codeine and morphine and more pronounced adverse effects on both drugs as compared to placebo.; This study confirms that codeine O-demethylation depends on CYP2D6; it shows that the 6-glucuronidation of morphine is independent of CYP2D6; it supports the theory that the analgesic effect of codeine depends on its O-demethylation; and it indicates that this is probably also the case for the adverse effects. The results lend no support to the suggestion of a non-opioid analgesic effect of codeine.",E,E

Patients in group I received a transdermal patch containing 0.16 mg/cm2 of fentanyl, which was applied to the skin over the subclavian area 60 minutes before the induction of anesthesia. For body weight less than 60 kg, a 30 cm2 patch was applied, and for weight greater than 60 kg, a 40 cm2 patch was used. A second group of 20 patients received placebo patches of identical size. Approximately 20 to 30 minutes before the expected end of surgery, 60 mg ketorolac was administered intramuscularly. Patients were observed for 36 hours after placement of the patch. If patients reported their pain at rest as 5 or greater at rest on a 0-10 visual analog scale, they were given 30-mg increments of ketorolac 5 to 7 hours apart. If this regimen did not relieve their pain, they received 1,300 mg acetaminophen between two ketorolac doses. If despite this, they still had pain 30 minutes afterward, intravenous morphine was given, and the patients were excluded from further study. The patch was removed in four patients in the fentanyl group and seven in the placebo group for various reasons, which included, inadequate pain relief requiring additional analgesia postoperatively and more than 1 microgram/kg of sufentanil given intraoperatively or immediately prior to the end of surgery. During the 36-hour observation period, 30 doses of 30 mg ketorolac and 14 doses of 1.3 g acetaminophen were given to 13 patients in the placebo group and 18 doses of ketorolac and 8 doses of acetaminophen were administered to 16 in the fentanyl group.; The differences in postoperative analgesic requirements were significant. Plasma fentanyl concentrations at 12 and 24 hours after the application of the fentanyl patch were 0.98 +/- 0.14 ng/mL and 1.22 +/- 0.17 ng/mL, respectively. At 8, 16, 24, and 36 hours after application of the patch, the pain relief, assessed by a VAS at rest and with movement, was similar in the two groups. In the fentanyl and control groups, 12 and 5 patients, respectively, experienced nausea, and 2 and 3 patients, respectively, vomited.; Similar postoperative analgesia was achieved with less parenteral analgesics in patients who received transdermal fentanyl preoperatively than in control patients. Fentanyl, 50-75 micrograms/h, administered in a transdermal delivery system, did not depress respiratory rate or hemoglobin oxygen saturation. Although the exact role of continuously administered opioids in managing acute postoperative pain has yet to be clearly defined, it is concluded that if properly used, this new transdermal device can be effective in providing a background of analgesia, which may assist in the management of acute postoperative pain as well as some chronic pain states.",E,E
9012294,[Pain syndromes in AIDS].,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Humans; Pain; Pain Management,"Wesselmann, U","Pain is a major, but largely neglected problem in AIDS patients. The aim of this article is to review the etiology of pain manifestations in AIDS patients in different organ systems and to discuss appropriate treatment strategies. The most common pain symptoms in AIDS patients are headache, oral cavity pain, dysphagia and adynophagia, chest pain, abdominal pain and pain related to peripheral neuropathy. Symptomatic pain treatment should be started while diagnostic work-up is still in progress, so that the patient does not suffer. If etiological treatment is possible, specific treatment pain treatment tapered as tolerated. If etiological treatment is not possible, symptomatic pain treatment should be continued. In view of the multiple organs involved in the presentation of AIDS requiring multiple drugs, careful attention to side effects, contraindications and drug interactions is warranted, when administering pain medications. Fear of the complexity of these issues should, however, not prevent effective pain management for these patients, who suffer from a fatal disease. A multidisciplinary approach to pain in AIDS patients, similar to the approach in patients with cancer, is desirable.",E,E

Heat loss mainly occurs during anaesthesia and surgery and leads to increased risk, especially in the early recovery period of elderly patients. In the present study we investigated the effects of intraoperative forced-air warming, administered via an upper-body blanket (""Warm Touch"", Mallinckrodt, USA), with the specific aims of: (1) drawing up heat balances; and (2) analysing postoperative thermoregulation, oxygen consumption (VO2) and cardiovascular reactions of mechanically ventilated patients. The general aim of our study was to compare intraoperative forced-air-warming and conventional patient-insulation with cotton blankets.; Twenty four ASA II and III patients scheduled for elective colon surgery were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 12, no warming therapy, upper body covered with a cotton hospital blanket) or a convective warming group (n = 12). Anaesthesia was administered with etomidate (0.2 mg/kg), fentanyl (approximately 10 micrograms/kg) and vecuronium bromide (0.1 mg/kg). During surgery the lungs were mechanically ventilated with 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen and enflurane (end-tidal-concentration max. 0.7%) using a semiclosed circuit with a fresh gas flow of 3 l/min. A hygrophobe heat and moisture exchanger (""Sterivent,"" Darex Corp., Italy) was used. At the end of surgery patients were transferred to the ICU, covered with a hospital cotton-quilt and normo-ventilated using a Bennett 7200 a. Patients were sedated/kept free of pain by administering titrated doses of midazolam and/or piritramide. Postoperative oxygen consumption (VO2) was recorded continuously with a Deltatrac Metabolic Monitor (Datex Corp., Finland). Pre-, intra- and postoperative measurements included heart rate, invasive blood pressure, core-temperature (before and after operation: urinary bladder-temperature, during surgery: oesophageal temperature) and mean-skin-temperature (according to Ramanathan) up to 180 min from the end of surgery. Shivering, pharmacological interventions (e.g. pethidine) and time of extubation were noted. Data are presented as median, minima and maxima. The results were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test or Chi-Square test (shivering). Statistical significance was assumed when P < 0.05.; Both groups were comparable for gender, body weight, height, age, duration of their operations and amount of intraoperative fluids, narcotics and muscle relaxants. Room temperatures in the control group were significantly higher than in the forced air group (24 vs 22 degrees C). Initial setting of the forced-air blower was ""high"" (42-46 degrees high air flow). When the oesophageal-temperature reached 36.5 degrees C, the blower temperature was reduced to 36-40 degrees C. Reduction was necessary approximately 60 min from start in the operation. At the end of surgery/administration to the ICU core-temperatures of both groups differed significantly (35.2/ 35.4 degrees C vs 36.3/36.2 degrees C). Mean-skin temperatures were higher, too, but no statistical analysis was carried out for the intraoperative period, because warm air influenced skin thermometers located on the upper body. At admission to the ICU patients in the control group had a heat loss of 4.4 kJ/kg; those in the convective warming group had a heat-gain of 0.8 kJ/kg. Further measurements of postoperative core temperatures did not differ significantly, but the skin-temperatures of patients who received forced-air warming in the theatre remained higher (P < 0.05) until 120 min from the end of surgery. Shivering was more frequent and lasted longer in the control group (8 patients, 20 min vs 4 patients, 9 min; P < 0.05). Patients in the control group needed more drugs to stop increased cardiovascular reactions (hypertension, tachycardia) or shivering.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",E,E

However, the benefit of the most often used combination of intravenous midazolam and pethidine on patient tolerance and pain and its cardiorespiratory risk have not been fully defined.; In this double-blind prospective study, 150 outpatients undergoing routine colonoscopy were randomly assigned to receive either (1) low-dose midazolam (35 micrograms/kg) and pethidine (700 micrograms/kg in 48 patients, 500 micrograms/kg in 102 patients), (2) midazolam and placebo pethidine, or (3) pethidine and placebo midazolam.; Tolerance (visual analog scale, 0 to 100 points: 0 = excellent; 100 = unbearable) did not improve significantly more in group 1 compared with group 2 (7 points; 95% confidence interval [-2-17]) and group 3 (2 points; 95% confidence interval [-7-12]). Similarly, pain was not significantly improved in group 1 as compared with the other groups. Male gender (p < 0.001) and shorter duration of the procedure (p = 0.004), but not amnesia, were associated with better patient tolerance and less pain. Patient satisfaction was similar in all groups. Oxygen desaturation and hypotension occurred in 33% and 11%, respectively, with a similar frequency in all three groups.; In this study, the combination of low-dose midazolam and pethidine does not improve patient tolerance and lessen pain during colonoscopy as compared with either drug given alone. When applying low-dose midazolam, oxygen desaturation and hypotension do not occur more often after combined use of both drugs. For the individual patient, sedation and analgesia should be based on the endoscopist's clinical judgement.",E,E

Electrical tooth pulp stimulation elicits a painful sensation and produces an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal that can be recorded from the scalp when precisely controlled dental stimuli are delivered. These somatosensory evoked potentials (EP) consist of a series of peaks or waves each characterized by their polarity, latency, and amplitude. They are obtained by processing the EEG signals that occur after tooth pulp stimulation. There is good correlation between subjective pain reports and evoked potential amplitudes (N150-P250 component). Thus, EP may provide a useful model for the assessment of analgesic activity in human volunteers. We describe an improved method for producing and recording tooth pulp evoked potentials in six healthy subjects. Only 16 EEG epochs were necessary to get a reproducible EP response from the participants. The approach was applied to study the efficacy of codeine (60 mg administered orally); a decrease in the evoked potential amplitudes after codeine administration was observed. The data were consistent with results from visual analog pain ratings given by the subjects.",E,E

Patients were treated individually and switched to transdermal fentanyl from other opioids when oral delivery was no longer possible. Doses were titrated as necessary and ranged from 25 micrograms/h to 300 micrograms/h. Incidental pain was treated effectively with short-acting opioids.; Eighty percent of patients experienced good analgesia, which led to an overall improvement in their quality of life. Transdermal fentanyl was discontinued for 17% of patients due to intractable nausea, diarrhea, adherence problems, or poor analgesia. Many patients wore the system until they died or until a few days before death when severe increasing pain necessitated parenteral opioids. The side effects of transdermal fentanyl were similar to those of conventional opioids. Patient compliance and acceptance of this noninvasive, continuous system of drug delivery has been excellent; its simplicity of administration allows patients to be cared for at home.",E,E

The authors describe the case history of the patient, in whom pain assessments were made, and a surgical procedure performed. Despite large doses of opiate analgesic medications, the patient experienced constant pressure pain in the right lower pelvis, with excruciating pain on bowel movement. Severe weight loss necessitated better pain control. A minimally invasive surgical procedure, a 5-mm deep puncture using a 16-gauge needle on either side of the median septum in the dorsal column of the spinal cord (T-8), resulted in no new neurological deficits. Narcotic medication was tapered, no pain was reported, and the patient resumed daily household activity. Midline myelotomy has typically been performed with the intention of eliminating the crossing fibers of the spinothalamic tract in the anterior white matter commissure. The punctate midline myelotomy described here was performed with the specific intention of interrupting a newly described visceral pain pathway that ascends to higher brain centers through the midline of the dorsal column. The effectiveness of the pain relief seen in this patient suggests that visceral pain of the pelvis in humans may be transmitted in the midline of the dorsal column, as has been recently reported in studies using rats. The effectiveness of the punctate midline myelotomy performed in this one case of pelvic visceral pain suggests that the surgery may eventually be effective in greatly reducing or replacing opiate narcotic medication for visceral pain management.",E,E

Appropriate tests include pelvic ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Ultimately, laparoscopy may provide the final diagnosis. Management should address the underlying cause(s) of pain; when this cannot be done, it should focus on treating the pain itself. When appropriate, empiric administration of antidepressants may be considered. In selected women, therapeutic goals may be achieved by electrical stimulation of nerves.",E,E

Patients were allocated randomly to one of the three groups to receive balanced anaesthesia with bolus injections of fentanyl (group F), sufentanil (group S) or alfentanil (group A). In the recovery room all patients received the same analgesic regimen, comprising TCIA. To evaluate the efficacy of postoperative analgesia, pain scores were measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and patients indicated a need for additional analgesia. EC50, the concentration at which, with a 50% probability, patients reported adequate analgesia, was estimated using logistic regression. Six patients did not complain of pain. The time from the last intraoperative bolus injection of opioid until patients complained of postoperative pain was shorter (P < 0.05) in group A (mean 68 min) than in group F (101 min) and group S (136 min). The time to onset of satisfactory analgesia was comparable in the three groups (median 18 min in group F, 15 min in group S and 14 min in group A). EC50 of alfentanil was determined in 28 patients; mean values were 26 ng ml-1 (group F), 39 ng ml-1 (group S) and 52 ng ml-1 (group A). We conclude that TCIA, under the conditions studied, resulted in a fast onset of adequate analgesia, irrespective of the opioid administered during operation. Also, there was no effect of opioids administered during operation on postoperative pharmacodynamics of alfentanil.",E,E

9061094,Morphine metabolites.,"Analgesics, Opioid; Animals; Humans; Morphine; Morphine Derivatives; Receptors, Opioid","Christrup, L L","Morphine is a potent opioid analgesic widely used for the treatment of acute pain and for long-term treatment of severe pain. Morphine is a member of the morphinan-framed alkaloids, which are present in the poppy plant. The drug is soluble in water, but its solubility in lipids is poor. In man, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) are the major metabolites of morphine. The metabolism of morphine occurs not only in the liver, but may also take place in the brain and the kidneys. The glucuronides are mainly eliminated via bile and urine. Glucuronides as a rule are considered as highly polar metabolites unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. Although morphine glucuronidation has been demonstrated in human brain tissue, the capacity is very low compared to that of the liver, indicating that the M3G and M6G concentrations observed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after systemic administration reflect hepatic metabolism of morphine and that the morphine glucuronides, despite their high polarity, can penetrate into the brain. Like morphine, M6G has been shown to be relatively more selective for mu-receptors than for delta- and kappa-receptors while M3G does not appear to compete for opioid receptor binding. The analgesic properties of M6G were recognised in the early 1970s and more recent work suggests that M6G might significantly contribute to the opioid analgesia after administration of morphine. The analgesic potency of M6G after intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intrathecal (IT) administration in rats is from 45-800 timer greater than that of morphine, depending on the animal species and the experimental antinociceptive test used. Furthermore, the development of a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay for the quantitative determination of morphine, M6G and M3G has revealed that M6G and M3G were present in abundance after chronic oral morphine administration and that the area under the plasma concentration-time curve exceeded that of morphine. M3G has been found to antagonise morphine and M6G induced analgesia and ventilatory depression in the rat, which has led to the hypothesis that M3G may influence the development of morphine tolerance. M3G exhibits no analgesic effect after ICV or IT administration. Some studies do, however, indicate that M3G may cause non-opioid mediated hyperalgesia/allodynia and convulsions after IT administration in rats. These observations led to the hypothesis that M3G might be responsible for side-effects, hyperalgesia/allodynia and myoclonus seen after high-dose morphine treatment.",E,E
9061100,Psychomotor and cognitive functioning in cancer patients.,"Analgesics, Opioid; Cognition; Humans; Neoplasms; Pain; Psychomotor Performance","Sj酶gren, P","Psychomotor and cognitive dysfunction in cancer patients can be classified into two main categories according to etiology: disease-induced factors (metabolic disturbances, brain metastasis, pain, etc.) and treatment-related factors (drugs, antineoplastic therapy, etc.). In particular, the effects of chronic opioid administration in cancer patients have been subjected to investigations, and most studies have been engaged in assessment and treatment of the cerebral dysfunction. Early studies found that cancer patients in chronic oral opioid therapy had prolonged continuous reaction times, and that the opioids seemed to be mainly responsible for the prolongation. Significant dose escalations of opioids (> or = 30%) caused transiently impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions in cancer patients. Cancer patients in chronic oral opioid therapy did not achieve any advantages changing to epidural opioid therapy with regard to faster continuous reaction times and less pain. Large doses of opioids are often required to control severe pain in cancer patients. As increased sedation and impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions often occur, a number of studies have investigated the use of amphetamine derivatives to counteract the sedative side-effects of opioid. These drugs seem promising during high-dose opioid therapy and their use may be particularly rewarding in poor opioid-responsive pain conditions such as incident and neuropathic pain.",E,E

Among the reasons for pursuing pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic relationships is the prospect of predicting the time-action characteristics of new therapeutics on the basis of early studies in normals using pharmacodynamic surrogates for analgesia. The realization of such a model could improve the efficiency of development of analgesics. Four studies involving 98 normals were conducted to determine whether significant and reproducible relationships existed for oxycodone in the form of an oral controlled-release tablet. All studies were analytically blinded and utilized a validated gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric, sensitive (0.2 ng/ml), and specific method for oxycodone (four studies) and oxymorphone (two studies) quantitation in 17 to 20 serial plasma samples over 36 to 48 hours following a single 20 mg (or 40 mg) dose in each study. Concurrent assessments included vital signs and opioid effect VAS questionnaires. The studies demonstrated significant relationships between plasma oxycodone (but not oxymorphone) and pharmacodynamic surrogates (particularly VAS ""drug effect"") and were predictive of the 12-hour duration of pain control and prompt onset of analgesia subsequently demonstrated in multiple clinical studies involving patients with various pathological pain syndromes. The results suggest that investigators can make earlier, accurate predictions of opioid analgesic pharmacodynamics in patients based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies in normal volunteers.",E,E

Some pains are controlled by analgesic drugs, but at the cost of intolerable side effects. This is true both for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. The worst pains are most often controlled by opioids, but problems of tolerance and addiction limit these successes. This contribution provides a statement on non-addictive, non-opioid drugs which help to control pain. Just as these vary in their success, so they vary also in the strength of the scientific evidence which supports their use. The groups of drugs to be considered can be evaluated in three respects; evidence of analgesic effect in controlled trials; evidence of side-effects compared with control substances and with standard experience; evidence of usefulness in clinical practice. The latter which is the most important for practice often has the least scientific proof. Six main classes of drugs are recognized which provide analgesic effects, other than opioids. 1) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely accepted as analgesics on the basis of animal studies, numerous controlled investigations and clinical practice. Acetaminophene may not be anti-inflammatory, but is recognized as an effective analgesic which in many other respects resembles the above. 2) Muscle relaxants, e.g. cyclobenzaprine or baclofen have varied actions, but often provide some relief of pain. 3) Antidepressants may be analgesic if they relieve depression which is giving rise to pain. This applies to all anti-depressants. Some antidepressants have been shown to be analgesic in the absence of depression. The best accredited of these is amitriptyline. Antidepressants too have significant side effects. A serotoninergic hypothesis is insufficient to explain the actions of antidepressants in relieving pain in the absence of depression. 4) Phenothiazine neuroleptics (and possibly some others) may be analgesic. Drugs reported to be analgesic include chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine, methotrimeprazine (levomepromazine) among others. Haloperidol has also been utilized. Well controlled evidence exists with the use of methotrimeprazine (levomepromazine) used as an injection. The analgesic effect of oral neuroleptics is less well established and mostly depends upon clinical observation, withdrawal and re-challenge. 5) Anticonvulsants. 6) Other drugs. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and some muscle relaxants, e.g. cyclobenzaprine are best used in the short term. The gastrointestinal side effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been quite troublesome and over 2% of patients followed over five years are at risk of developing peptic ulceration from such medication. Cyclobenzaprine is best used in short term treatment, but may be used intermittently for chronic pain. Antidepressants, neuroleptics, anticonvulsants and some other drugs can be used long term. Topical analgesic agents may also be used.",E,E

We studied the analgesic effect of intra-articular opioids in 70 patients, divided into 7 groups, subjected to arthroscopic knee surgery in general anesthesia. The dimension of the study was based on a power of 0.8 to detect a 25% difference in pain intensity between those receiving opioids locally versus systemically (alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.20). Following surgery, but before terminating anesthesia, the patients received one of the following combinations: 1 mg morphine intra-articularly (i.art.) + saline intramuscularly (i.m.), 10 mg pethidine i.art + saline i.m., or 10 micrograms fentanyl i.art + saline i.m. In three additional groups the three opioids were given i.m. and saline given i.art. An additional control group received saline i.art. + i.m. We did not find any significant difference between the groups considering postoperative pain intensity, need for analgesics or considering time to standing/walking or to discharge, analysing each opioid independently. There was, however, a tendency for pethidine i.art. to produce the lowest pain scores both at rest and during movement (P = 0.06). If analysing the results with regards to if opioids were given intra-articularly or systemically, not considering the type of opioid given, we did however, find a significantly lower total sum of pain scores at movement following local administration (P < 0.05). No specific side-effects were detected. We conclude that pethidine given intra-articularly merits further investigation with respect to postoperative analgesia following the activation of peripheral opioid mechanisms.",E,E

Sometimes, however, the oral route cannot be used because of difficulties with swallowing, nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal obstruction. To investigate the applicability of the nasal route for the administration of oxycodone, we studied the intravenous and intranasal pharmacokinetics of oxycodone in healthy volunteers.; Ten healthy volunteers (3 males and 7 females) were given either an intravenous bolus of oxycodone hydrochloride 0.05 mg/kg or nasal sprays of oxycodone hydrochloride 0.1 mg/kg in a cross-over manner. Blood was sampled and subjective effects and side effects were recorded for 10 h.; After intravenous administration of oxycodone, the plasma clearance of oxycodone was 0.83 +/- 0.33 l/min (mean +/- SD) and the volume of distribution at steady-state 2.02 +/- 1.47 l/kg and the terminal elimination half-life 157 +/- 47 min. After intranasal administration, peak plasma concentration of oxycodone was 13 +/- 6 ng/ml and it was reached in the median time of 25 min. The intranasal bioavailability of oxycodone was 0.46 +/- 0.34. No clinically significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate were observed but all subjects experienced somnolence after both modes of administration.; The results of this study show that oxycodone is rapidly and rather effectively absorbed from the nasal mucosa but the interindividual differences are large. The intranasal route may in some cases be an attractive alternative to oral or parenteral administration of opioid analgesics. However, because of large interindividual differences, it is prudent to titrate the dose of intranasal oxycodone individually.",E,E

Preventing rostral spread of intrathecal sufentanil should limit these side effects. Both direction of the lateral opening of a pencil-point needle and drug baricity modify the spread of intrathecal local anesthetics. This randomized, prospective, double-blind study examines the effects of these variables on intrathecal sufentanil labor analgesia.; Forty laboring, full-term parturients, whose cervixes were dilated less than 5 cm and who requested analgesia for labor were enrolled. Combined spinal epidural analgesia was induced in patients in the sitting position. They were allocated to receive 10 micrograms intrathecal sufentanil diluted with either normal saline or dextrose with the aperture of the pencil-point needle directed cephalad or caudad during drug injection. Thus there were four groups of ten patients: dextrose up, dextrose down, saline up, and saline down. Sufentanil was diluted with normal saline to a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml. The study drug was made by mixing 1 ml sufentanil solution with either 1 ml 10% dextrose or 1 ml normal saline. Visual analog scores for pain, pruritus, nausea, and pain relief were recorded before and 5, 10, 15, and 30 min after drug injection.; Baricity, but not needle orientation, influenced pain relief and pruritus. Sufentanil in dextrose produced less itching but also less analgesia. Nine of 20 women in the dextrose groups compared with 1 of 20 in the saline groups requested additional analgesia by 30 min.; Little or no labor analgesia developed for patients receiving sufentanil with dextrose. A supraspinal action may contribute to intrathecal sufentanil's analgesic efficacy.",E,E

It is not clear whether opioids, when effective, relieve pain by decreasing pain intensity or pain unpleasantness or by their sedative effect. The aim of this prospective randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial was to assess relief of pain intensity and pain unpleasantness with intravenous infusions of fentanyl.; We compared the analgesic effect of intravenous dose titration of fentanyl with diazepam (active placebo) or saline (inert placebo) in 53 patients with different types of neuropathic pain. Patients were randomly assigned two consecutive infusions: fentanyl plus diazepam (27 patients) or fentanyl plus saline (26 patients). Study medication was infused at a constant rate for a maximum of 5 h. Pain, sedation, and side-effects were assessed from the start of infusion for 8 h. The primary outcome measure was maximum relief of pain intensity.; One patient in the fentanyl/diazepam group and two in the fentanyl/saline group were withdrawn. Maximum relief of pain intensity was better with fentanyl than with diazepam (66% [95% CI 53-80] vs 23% [12-35]) or with saline (50% [36-63] vs 12% [4-20]). The beneficial effect of fentanyl was independent of the type of neuropathic pain and the degree of sedation. Fentanyl therapy produced equal relief of pain intensity and pain unpleasantness, whereas diazepam and saline did not reduce either pain index. Patients reported significantly more side-effects while receiving fentanyl than during diazepam or saline infusion (p < 0.0001), but none of the side-effects was severe.; Fentanyl may relieve non-cancer neuropathic pain by its intrinsic analgesic effect. The clinical characteristics of neuropathic pain do not predict response to opioids.",E,E

Tramadol is a synthetic analogue of codeine that binds to mu opiate receptors and inhibits norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake. It is rapidly and extensively absorbed after oral doses and is metabolized in the liver. Analgesia begins within one hour and starts to peak in two hours. In patients with moderate postoperative pain, i.v. or i.m. tramadol is roughly equal in efficacy to meperidine or morphine; for severe acute pain, tramadol is less effective than morphine. Oral tramadol can also be effective after certain types of surgery. Tramadol and meperidine are equally effective in postoperative patient-controlled analgesia. In epidural administration for pain after abdominal surgery, tramadol is more effective than bupivacaine but less effective than morphine. In patients with ureteral calculi, both dipyrone and butylscopolamine are more effective than tramadol. For labor pain, i.m. tramadol works as well as meperidine and is less likely to cause neonatal respiratory depression. Oral tramadol is as effective as codeine for acute dental pain. In several types of severe or refractory cancer pain, tramadol is effective, but less so than morphine; for other types of chronic pain, such as low-back pain, oral tramadol works as well as acetaminophen-codeine. Common adverse effects of tramadol include dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, and sedation. The abuse potential seems low. The recommended oral dosage is 50-100 mg every four to six hours. Tramadol is an effective, if expensive, alternative to other analgesics in some clinical situations.",E,E

After the treatment, hyperalgesia and allodynia improved dramatically, and the receptive field also reduced. After four weeks' treatment, satisfactory pain relief was achieved with conventional analgesics treatment. The combination of relatively low doses of morphine, ketamine and bupivacaine epidurally provides effective pain relief in this case. The result strongly suggests a synergy from this combination that warrants a formal study of the dose-response relationship involved in this treatment and the mechanism by which this effect is achieved.

Eighteen randomised, double-blind, parallel-group single-dose trials with 3453 patients using categorical pain relief scales allowed the calculation of %maxTOTPAR. The use of > 50%maxTOTPAR was a sensitive measure to discriminate between analgesics. Tramadol and comparator drugs gave significantly more analgesia than placebo. In postsurgical pain tramadol 50, 100 and 150 mg had NNTs for > 50%maxTOTPAR of 7.1 (95% confidence intervals 4.6-18), 4.8 (3.4-8.2) and 2.4 (2.0-3.1), comparable with aspirin 650 mg plus codeine 60 mg (NNT 3.6 (2.5-6.3)) and acetaminophen 650 mg plus propoxyphene 100 mg (NNT 4.0 (3.0-5.7)).

With the same dose of drug postsurgical pain patients had fewer adverse events than those having dental surgery. Adverse events (headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, somnolence) with tramadol 50 mg and 100 mg had a similar incidence to comparator drugs. There was a dose response with tramadol, tending towards higher incidences at higher doses. Single-patient meta-analysis using more than half pain relief provides a sensitive description of the analgesic properties of a drug, and NNT calculations allow comparisons to be made with standard analgesics. Absolute ranking of analgesic performance should be done separately for postsurgical and dental pain.",E,E

The morphine dose was optimised for each patient using an immediate release morphine solution in the lead-in period to provide the most favourable balance between pain relief and side-effects. Patients were then randomly allocated to receive their 24-h morphine dose as either Kapanol or MS Contin in period 1. Patients recorded daily measures of pain relief and morphine related side-effects (morphine pharmacodynamics) in a diary. Patients were admitted to the Pain Management Unit on the morning of day 7 (+/- 1 day) and frequent blood samples were collected for 24 h following the 10:00 h dose to fully characterise the pharmacokinetic profile for morphine and its metabolites at steady state. Morphine pharmacodynamics and the amount and timing of rescue medication (dextromoramide) were also recorded during this time. Period 2, which commenced at 10:00 h on day 8, was identical to period 1 except the modified release formulations were changed. The pharmacokinetic profile of Kapanol exhibited a significantly higher Cmin (minimum plasma morphine concentration), less fluctuation in plasma morphine concentration throughout the dosing interval, a longer Tmax (time associated with the maximum morphine concentration) and a greater time that the plasma morphine concentration was > or = 75% of Cmax (an index of the control the formulation exerts over the morphine release rate) compared to that of MS Contin. Some of these pharmacokinetic differences (e.g., Cmin and fluctuation in plasma morphine concentration) were surprising given that the dosing interval for Kapanol (24 h) was double that of MS Contin (12 h). There was no significant difference between the Kapanol and MS Contin treatment phases in any of the pharmacodynamic parameters, morphine related side-effects, the percentage of patients taking rescue medication as well as the amount or time to the first dose of rescue analgesia on day 7 in periods 1 and 2, patient or investigator assessments of global efficacy at the end of periods 1 and 2, or patient treatment preference at the end of the study.

After initial screening, 53 of 68 patients (77%) elected internalization of their devices; 42 of the 53 (79%) continue to receive adequate relief of pain. Therefore, effective pain control was achieved in 42 of 68 of our initially referred patients (62%). Patients with failed back syndrome, trigeminal neuropathy, and peripheral neuropathy fared well with DBS, whereas those with thalamic pain, spinal cord injury, and postherpetic neuralgia did poorly.; DBS in selected patients provides long-term effective pain control with few side effects or complications.",E,E

Patients in the treatment group listened to music through head-phones during the last 30 minutes of their surgical procedures and during the first hour in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Patients in the control group had identical surgical procedures, received the same preoperative medications, and were managed with the same anesthesia protocol but did not listen to music in the OR or PACU. No differences existed between the two patient groups in the variables measured; however, patients in the treatment group stated that music helped them relax and functioned as a distracter.",E,E

DHE 45) and repetitive i.v. DHE and compared the efficacy of continuous i.v. DHE to repetitive i.v. DHE. One hundred (58.5%) patients had refractory chronic daily headache. Seventy-one (42%) had drug rebound headache. One hundred thirty-eight (81%) had refractory migraine without aura, and 28 (16%) had migraine with aura. Treatment consisted of either continuous i.v. DHE by infusion pump or repetitive i.v. DHE and withdrawal of excessively used analgesics, analgesic narcotics, ergotamines, or benzodiazepines. Eighty-nine (92.5%) patients treated with continuous i.v. DHE became headache-free; the majority, 62 (64.5%), within 3 days. Sixty-five (86.5%) patients treated by repetitive i.v. DHE became headache-free, 50 (66.5%) within three days. The average hospital stay for both treatment groups was 4 days. Twelve (12.5%) of the continuous group and 12 (16%) of the repetitive group were headache-free within 24 hours. The average length of time to become headache-free was similar for the two groups, 3.06 days for continuous i.v. DHE and 2.94 days for repetitive i.v. DHE. The most common side effect was nausea, followed by diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. We conclude that DHE can be accurately and easily administered by continuous i.v. infusion pump, and that continuous i.v. DHE is a safe and efficacious mode of treatment producing results similar to repetitive i.v. DHE.",E,E

This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and postoperative outcomes of intravenous PCA compared to intramuscular (IM) injections in 73 patients who received major abdominal surgery. These patients were randomly selected and randomly assigned preoperatively to receiving IM or PCA modes of analgesia postoperatively. The following factors were compared: amount of pain; amount of analgesia use; degree of patient satisfaction with pain control both while on parenteral analgesia and after switching to oral; length of time to first ambulation; and length of stay in hospital. Results of the study did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in any of these, using a P-value of 0.01. The PCA patients took an average of 4.5 hours longer than the IM patients to ambulate postoperatively and the IM patients received at least three times as much antiemetic (P = 0.001). Locus of control was not found to be a major factor in satisfaction or pain levels. Subsequent meta-analyses have also failed to yield significant differences between IM and PCA groups except in patient satisfaction.

9107526,Management of sickle pain.,"Anemia, Sickle Cell; Humans; Pain; Pain Management","Ballas, S K","Sickle cell disease is characterized by recurrent episodes of acute pain. Some patients also suffer from chronic pain syndromes including avascular necrosis, leg ulcers, and intractable pain. Approaches to rational therapy of sickle pain include pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and preventive therapeutic interventions. Pharmacologic treatment of sickle pain entails the use of nonopioid analgesics, opioid analgesics, and adjuvants singly or in combination depending on the severity of pain. Meticulous evaluation and assessment of painful episodes should precede and accompany all approaches to management. The choice of the opioid analgesic, its route of administration, dose, and frequency of administration should be individualized on a case-by-case basis. Meperidine should be avoided whenever possible. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, meperidine, and morphine are contraindicated in the presence of renal failure. Administration of opioids on a fixed schedule or by patient-controlled analgesia is ideal for effective therapy. Nonpharmacologic approaches to manage sickle pain are underutilized and more studies are needed to determine their role in sickle pain. Preventive therapy of sickle pain is best achieved with hydroxyurea, which was found to decrease the frequency of crises significantly, decrease the incidence of acute chest syndrome, and decrease the need for blood transfusion.",3,E

The variety of drugs used suggests that there is no uniquely successful form of drug therapy. One reason for uncertainty and slow progress in this area is the limited quality of many clinical trials for back pain, with inadequate description of patients and outcomes being common deficits.; A selective review of randomized trials and systematic literature syntheses on drug therapy is given.; Despite limitations, there is good evidence to support the efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain and fair evidence for the use of muscle relaxants. There is greater controversy about the use of corticosteroids, which have been administered orally, intramuscularly, and epidurally. There is conflicting evidence regarding epidural injection of corticosteroids, but one meta-analysis suggests they may provide a small symptomatic improvement for patients with radiculopathy. Trials of systemic steroids and antidepressant drugs for managing chronic pain are inconclusive. The only randomized trial of local anesthetic injection into trigger points suggested that this treatment was equivalent to that of saline injection, needling without injection, or vapo-coolant spray alone.; It seems reasonable to recommend acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for patients with acute back pain, with efforts to minimize costs and complications. Muscle relaxants and narcotic analgesics may be appropriate for some patients, but selection criteria are unclear, and these drugs should be prescribed for fixed periods. Drug treatment for chronic low back pain is less clear, and a current controversy centers on the use of chronic narcotic analgesics for such patients. Future research should include evaluating combinations of medications, combinations of medication and physical therapy, systemic corticosteroid therapy, trigger point injections, and narcotic use for patients with chronic pain. Spinal stenosis is common in the older population, and more drug trials are needed for this condition.",3,E

Furthermore, the addition of fentanyl has been reported to increase preferentially intraoperative analgesia. In the present study we set out to study these two issues in a randomized and controlled study with respect to perceived pain and discomfort during surgery and postoperative pain.; In the present study, 100 parturients subjected to elective cesarean section, 34 nullipara and 66 multipara, received one out of four combinations of the local anesthetic bupivacaine and the opioid fentanyl; group A--bupivacaine 12.5 mg + 10 micrograms fentanyl subarachnoidally, group B--bupivacaine 12.5 mg + saline subarachnoidally, group C--bupivacaine 100 mg + 100 micrograms fentanyl epidurally, group D--bupivacaine 100 mg + saline epidurally; N = 25 in each group. Pain intensity and discomfort during surgery was assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS). Postoperative pain intensity and need for analgesics postoperatively, ketobemidone, was registered for 24 h following surgery.; Intraoperative pain intensity and discomfort did not differ significantly between parturients in any of the four groups Postoperative pain was significantly more intense in parturients receiving local anesthetics subarachnoidally as compared to the epidural groups during the first 6-h period. This difference was also reflected in a significantly increased consumption of analgesics during this period. No significant differences between the groups were observed with regard to hemodynamics (blood pressure), respiration (oxygen saturation) or other effects such as nausea or itching. All neonates had normal Apgar and neonatal adaptive capacity scores (NACS).; We conclude that subarachnoidal (12.5 mg) and epidural (100 mg) injections with bupivacaine both produced adequate anesthetic quality in women undergoing elective cesarean section. The addition of fentanyl (10 micrograms subarachnoidally or 100 micrograms epidurally) did not significantly improve the quality of these already profound blockades.",E,E

Since we do not use bladder drainage after reimplantation, dripping a morphine solution into the bladder permits contact with the urothelium between voidings. A pilot trial using an arbitrary concentration was subjectively beneficial for treating these patients postoperatively. We now report a prospective randomized study evaluating the effectiveness and dosage of various concentrations of intravesical morphine infusions.; A total of 52 children undergoing ureteral reimplantation was randomized to receive 1 of 3 concentrations of intravesical morphine (0.05, 0.375 or 0.5 mg./ml.). A small feeding tube remained in the bladder to drip a continuous infusion postoperatively. Subsequent postoperative pain was treated with meperidine, acetaminophen and codeine, and/or a belladonna and opium suppository. During each shift a nurse assisted the child in assessing pain using a Baker-Wong faces scale. Bladder infusion was discontinued after day 3 postoperatively and plasma morphine levels were measured on the first morning postoperatively.

Morphine administration began a few days before the start of the study. The analgesic effects of two combinations were compared: morphine (M) plus placebo (P) and morphine plus 90 mg/24 h of nimodipine (N). The study lasted 8 days, including the wash-out period, and the following sequence of treatments was applied: M + P or M + N on days 1, 2 and 3; only M on days 4 and 5; and M + N or M + P on days 6, 7 and 8. Morphine dose was individualised according to the intensity of the patient's pain and the same dose was maintained throughout the study period. Analgesic response was evaluated using four 10 cm visual analogue scales of quantitative variables for pain intensity, pain relief, sleep quality and mood. A verbal rating of qualitative variables was also scored following validated descriptors of pain in the Spanish language. No significant statistical differences were found in analgesic effect between combined treatment with nimodipine or placebo, as measured on any of the scales. In order to take into account both the short duration of treatment (8 days), and nimodipine's pharmacokinetic characteristics (half-life of 6 h and steady state of 36 h), we compared treatment with nimodipine or placebo on the third day of use, at which time, likewise, there were no statistically significant differences on any of the scales. However, when the same statistical tests were used for comparison of results with pre-treatment baseline values, highly significant differences between mean scores on the scales for pain relief and pain intensity were found. Based on these negative results we conclude that nimodipine given orally at a dose of 30 mg every 8 h does not enhance analgesia when associated with morphine in the early phases of treatment for cancer pain.

The present prospective study was designed to find out if the remembered intensity of postoperative pain (RIPP) after breast surgery was influenced by the development of chronic pain and if the RIPP had any correlation with the development of depression or anxiety. The patient's estimation of the severity of the RIPP was determined three times in the year after surgery. The state anxiety and depression and the presence of pain in the ipsilateral arm were assessed before the operation, and 1, 6 and 12 mos after surgery. Ninety-three consecutive female patients with breast cancer who were enrolled for surgical treatment were recruited to the study during 1993-1994. The patients were treated with modified radical mastectomy with axillary clearance (n = 53) or breast resection with axillary clearance (n = 40). The patients' records were checked for the consumption of analgesics within the first 48 h after surgery. The patients were analysed in three groups according to the presence or absence of preoperative or chronic post-treatment pain. There was a significant correlation between the RIPP and the consumption of both opioids and NSAIDs on the ward. The women who had chronic pain remembered having had more severe postoperative pain compared with those women who had no chronic pain. The RIPP increased with time in the chronic pain patients whereas it decreased in the patients who had no chronic pain. In all patients the preoperatively measured state anxiety and depression scores were higher than in healthy Finnish women. One year after surgery anxiety and depression had returned to normal levels except in the patients who had chronic pain. Their depression remained at a higher level during the first year after surgery. The results suggest that the amount of postoperative pain may play a role in the development of chronic pain. However, the development of chronic pain is connected to a tendency to overestimate previous pain and to higher levels of depression.",E,E

The aim of our study was to determine the characteristics of pain complaints and analgesic treatment, as well as the satisfaction degree of patients with their treatment. To this goal, an observational cross-sectional drug utilization study was undertaken in a sample of 74 patients of a nursing home. All of them were consuming analgesic drugs at the moment of the study and their mean (+/-standard deviation) was 75.5 +/- 13.9 years. The study analyzed several pain characteristics (intensity, etiology, localization and duration) as well as analgesic treatment features (drug, route of administration, prescribed dose and therapeutic compliance). The satisfaction with the therapeutic regimen was also evaluated. Nearly a third (32.4%) of patients described that they suffered severe pain, mostly from peripheral joints (70.1%) and mainly located in legs. The duration of pain was longer than one month in 56.8%. Most of patients were following a chronic treatment with scheduled analgesics, being paracetamol (28.7%) the most consumed drug. However, daily doses were less than considered effective to treat pain. The preferred route of administration was oral. The satisfaction degree varied nong the units of NH, but it was scored as acceptable in most patients. It may be concluded that pain is a highly prevalent issue in NH and, in spite of the provided analgesic treatment, was evaluated as severe by a significant group of patients. Although drugs were prescribed at ""by the clock"" patterns, the daily dose was below the recommended one. In spite of high prevalence of severe pain, patients were satisfied with the analgesic treatment they were receiving.",E,E

Further studies may more clearly define these and other secondary effects and also the real indications for these drugs in the context of analgesics for intraspinal use.

Propofol was administered (10 mg every 10 s) until loss of consciousness. Patients' lungs were ventilated with 66% nitrous oxide and 0.5% (end-tidal) isoflurane in oxygen. The study drug infusion rate was reduced by 50% 5 min after intubation. Alfentanil was discontinued 15 min before the end of surgery, whereas remifentanil was continued in the immediate postoperative period at a reduced dose. Responses to intubation (28%) and skin incision (17%) occurred approximately twice as often in the alfentanil group (15% and 8%; p = 0.014 and p = 0.037, respectively). More patients receiving alfentanil had one or more responses to surgery (72% vs. 57%; p = 0.016). The time to spontaneous respiration, adequate respiration, response to verbal command and time to recovery room discharge were similar. However, owing to decreased variability, the time to extubation was shorter with remifentanil than with alfentanil (p = 0.048). There was a similar overall incidence of adverse events in both groups, 82% and 75% of patients, respectively. Adverse events associated with remifentanil were rapidly controlled by dose reductions. The incidence of intra-operative hypotension and bradycardia was higher in the remifentanil group (p < or = 0.033). An initial remifentanil infusion rate of 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 titrated to individual need provided postoperative pain relief in the presence of adequate respiration in 71% of patients. When using remifentanil in the immediate postoperative setting, rapid administration of bolus doses and infusion rate increases resulted in a relatively high incidence of muscle rigidity, respiratory depression and apnoea. Changing the postoperative regimen to avoid rapid changes in remifentanil blood concentration resulted in more effective analgesia and dramatically reduced the incidence of adverse events during this period. In patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, remifentanil appears to offer superior intra-operative haemodynamic stability during stressful surgical events compared with alfentanil without compromising recovery from anaesthesia. Remifentanil can be administered as a postoperative analgesic agent at a starting dose of 0.1 microgram-.kg-1.min-1; however, it should only be used in the presence of adequate supervision and monitoring of the patient. Administration of bolus doses is not recommended in this setting.",E,E

We studied 60 patients undergoing Caesarean section. All received intrathecal 0.5% plain bupivacaine 2 ml combined with either fentanyl 0.5 ml (25 micrograms) (group F) (n = 30) or normal saline 0.5 ml (group S) (n = 30). In addition, 10 ml of an extradural solution (fentanyl 1 ml (50 micrograms) combined with 0.5% bupivacaine 9 ml) was administered after delivery. Extradural solution was only given before delivery if the intrathecal injection failed to produce a block above T6 or the patient required further analgesia. Postoperative analgesia was provided with i.v. morphine patient-controlled analgesia. At operation, intrathecal fentanyl reduced the need to administer extradural solution before delivery, increased the anaesthetist's satisfaction with analgesia and reduced nausea, but increased pruritus. Up to 6 h after delivery there was no difference in postoperative morphine requirements or pain scores. Between 6 h and 23 h there was a 63% increase in morphine requirements in group F. We consider the most likely explanation for this finding to be that intrathecal fentanyl induced acute spinal opioid tolerance.",E,E

This communication presents the main results of French national studies among representative samples of cancer patients and physicians (primary care physicians and medical oncologists) faced with cancer pain. These studies confirm that cancer pain is inadequately treated for 51% of patients and identify among French physicians attitudinal barriers to the proper use of morphine.

In 1995 a questionnaire was randomly sent to 5% (n = 546) of Finnish physicians, excluding specialists not expected to treat cancer patients. Two previous surveys, using the same questionnaire, were conducted in 1985 and 1990 by Vainio. The response rate was 53%. Seventy-nine percent of the respondents treated one or less than one cancer patient a week. Sixty-seven percent of them assessed the severity of cancer pain in their patients as being at least moderate. In 10 years, the proportion of physicians suggesting the WHO analgesic ladder principle to their 'typical cancer patient' had increased from 12% to 28%. At the same time, the suggestions of 'analgesic' without definition had decreased from 48% to 6%. Three simulated patient cases were presented. The mean daily dose of opioids suggested for severe terminal cancer pain corresponded to 72 (18-300) mg of intramuscular morphine in 1995, being only 39 (1-77) mg in 1985 for the same simulated patient case. Continuous infusion of opioid was recommended by 59% of the respondents. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as the treatment of choice for bone metastases pain in a patient with breast cancer, was recommended by 68% of the respondents. In the case of local severe pain due to recurrent rectal cancer, 63% of the physicians suggested anaesthetic intervention. Insufficient pain relief and lack of experience were the most common difficulties in pain management. Only one-third of the physicians thought that they had enough time and ability to give sufficient psychological support to their patients.",E,E

Blockade of afferent neuronal barrage has been reported to reduce pain following some, but not all, types of surgery. This study evaluated whether blockade of sensory input with a long-acting local anesthetic reduces postoperative pain after the anesthetic effects have dissipated. Forty-eight patients underwent oral surgery with general anesthesia in a parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects randomly received either 0.5% bupivacaine or saline intraoral injections, general anesthesia was induced with propofol, a non-opioid anesthetic, and 2-4 third molars extracted. Subjects were assessed at 24 and 48 h for postoperative pain and analgesic intake. Blood samples were collected at baseline, intraoperatively and at 1-h intervals postoperatively for measurement of beta-endorphin as an index of CNS response to nociceptor input. Plasma beta-endorphin levels increased significantly from baseline to the end of surgery in the saline group in comparison to the bupivacaine group (P < 0.05), indicating effective blockade of nociceptor input into the CNS by the local anesthetic. Pain intensity was not significantly different between groups at 24 h. Pain at 48 h was decreased in the bupivacaine group as measured by category scale and graphic rating scales for pain and unpleasantness (P < 0.05). Additionally, subjects in the bupivacaine group self-administered fewer codeine tablets for unrelieved pain over 24-48 h postoperatively (P < 0.05). These data support previous animal studies demonstrating that blockade of peripheral nociceptive barrage during and immediately after tissue injury results in decreased pain at later time points. The results suggest that blockade of nociceptive input by administration of a long-acting local anesthetic decreases the development of central hyperexcitability, resulting in less pain and analgesic intake.",E,E

Thirty-one children aged 3 months to 6 years undergoing major abdominal or genito-urological surgery were studied. After induction of anaesthesia a lumbar epidural catheter was placed at L3-4 or L4-5.

Sedation, pruritus, vomiting, and administration of antiemetics were seen in both treatment groups, and even though both the incidence and severity of side effects tended to be higher in children receiving morphine, no statistically significant difference was found. No episodes of respiratory depression or motor blockade were noticed.; Continuous epidural infusion of fentanyl and bupivacaine was found to be superior to intermittent epidural morphine.

A total of 131 adults (86 M, 45F) were treated with tramadol (one 100-mg slow-release tablet every 8-12 h), or buprenorphine (one sublingual 0.2-mg tablet every 6-8 h). The trial was to continue for up to six months. Most patients started treatment with 2-3 tablets/day in both groups, and the mean treatment period was 58 days for tramadol and 51 for buprenorphine. Almost all dose changes needed were made in the first fortnight in both treatment groups, and the largest number of patients dropped out because of inadequate pain relief or progression of the underlying disease. The results achieved in the first two weeks persisted throughout the rest of the trial, and the investigator's assessments on each patient's clinical chart corresponded closely with those that patients made in their own daily diaries. In the four hours after the first dose both drugs virtually halved the severity of pain (measured using a visual analogue scale), and this relief lasted throughout treatment. By the end of the first week the proportion of patients with strong/unbearable pain in the tramadol group had fallen significantly (from 98.4% to 48.1%, p < 0.05), as compared to a drop from 92% to 66.7% for buprenorphine. The quality of sleep also tended to improve in the tramadol group, with the proportion of patients enjoying good or deep sleep rising from 37% to 50%, as compared to 33% to 40-44% with buprenorphine. Karnofsky's and Spitzer's indices reflecting the quality of life did not change in the tramadol group; in the buprenorphine group the Karnofsky index dropped slightly after a fortnight (p < 0.05 between treatments).

There is much controversy over the definition, incidence, and risk factors of prescription opiate abuse in chronic pain treatment. The present study, done at the Seattle VA Medical Center, was designed to create opiate abuse criteria, test inter-rater reliability of the criteria, apply the criteria to a group of chronic pain patients, and correlate the risk of opiate abuse with the results of alcohol and drug testing.; A committee of experienced pain providers designed a five-point prescription opiate abuse checklist based on DSM-III-R parameters. The criteria were then applied to patients enrolled in the pain clinic. The reliability of the criteria were determined using two providers who were familiar with every patient in the clinic. Drug, alcohol, and psychosocial testing were correlated with the risk of opiate abuse.; A total of 19% (76/403) of all pain clinic patients were using chronic opiates. Thirty-four percent (26/76) met one, and 27.6% (21/76) met three or more of the abuse criteria. The criteria had an inter-rater reliability of > 0.9. There were no differences between chronic opiate users (n = 76) and opiate abusers (n = 21) for a history of drug or alcohol abuse or on psychosocial testing.; Prescription opiate abuse criteria for use in patients with chronic nonmalignant pain were designed. The criteria had good reliability and can be applied during normal clinic interactions. The percentage of chronic opiate users who become opiate abusers in pain treatment is within the range reported by others.

Venous blood samples were collected before anaesthesia and at five minute intervals for 30 min following anaesthesia for the measurement of plasma Epi and NE by high performance liquid chromatography. Maternal blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), visual analog scores (VAS) to pain and pruritus were recorded at the same time.; Both ITF and LEA decreased pain VAS scores, maternal BP, and plasma Epi concentrations with only minimal effects on plasma NE concentrations. Intrathecal fentanyl (ITF) and LEA reduced plasma epi to a similar extent, with ITF reducing the levels slightly faster than LEA. Intrathecal fentanyl(ITF) and LEA reduced plasma Epi concentrations by 52% and 51%, respectively (P value < 0.01).; We conclude that ITF is as effective as LEA in producing pain relief in the labouring patient.

Mandatory steps include, first, a prompt serious attempt to localize the nerve lesion whenever possible using complete, sophisticated neurologic examinations, then thoughtfully selected conventional neurophysiologic and radiologic tests. Strongly discouraged are promiscuous use of ""RSD"" to describe all neuropathic pains, and diagnostic reliance upon thermography and uncontrolled sympathetic blocks. Conservative multidisciplinary diagnostic and treatment teams should often possess a nucleus of neurologist and hand therapist, plus additional consultants including psychiatric. Every physician and therapist managing neuropathic pain must consider psychologic and wellness issues within their responsibilities. Prompt referral to an experienced surgeon is crucial for decompression or repair of relevant, significant, objectively proven (ideally neurophysiologically) nerve and root lesions. Ambiguous professional colloquialisms, ""central pain"" and ""central sensitization,"" unfortunately provide value-laden pretexts for premature invasive treatments, and animate the truly dreadful concept ""central RSD"". Various classes of conventional oral non-narcotic adjuvant analgesics are reviewed, and the inevitability of their empiric, non-formulaic administration. No patient-specific, rationally-identifiable molecular receptor/switch can be deduced clinically or tripped mechanistically to terminate chronic pain. Two promising new non-narcotic centrally-active medications, gabapentin and tramadol, are highlighted as harbingers of future progress.

9190320,[Review of current pharmacologic treatment of pain].,"Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic; Analgesics; Analgesics, Opioid; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Humans; Morphine; Pain","Brasseur, L","Pain is the main reason prompting patients to consult their physicians. In acute conditions, pain has a very particular significance as a warning sign, enabling the physician to attempt a diagnosis. Nevertheless, its detrimental effect upon the individual (even in the case of acute pain) and its cost to society are now widely acknowledged. There can be no doubt about the physical component of pain, but the psychological and social aspects should not be ignored, particularly in the case of chronic pain. There is no single therapeutic approach to pain and, more often than not, successful treatment comprises a combination of several. Pharmacological treatments are undeniably the most common approach. In clinical practice, recent advances have been based upon an improved understanding of 'old' substances such as morphine and, at the same time, research continues in the hope of finding the 'ideal' analgesic-effective in most situations but without adverse effects: this appears to be a somewhat utopian arm at present, considering the number of different causes of pain. An improved understanding of the physiological mechanisms of pain has led, within the field of clinical practice, to several methods of differentiating pain. These depend on whether or not pain responds to morphine, or on the type of pain: pain due to an excess of nociception, pain resulting from deafferentation (caused by damage to nerve pathways) in the central or peripheral nervous system and psychogenic (idiopathic) pain. Likewise, there are several different ways of classifying analgesic treatments: according to the intensity of pain, as with use of the WHO ladder (which is based on the notion of steps) for the treatment of cancer pain; according to the presumed physiopathological mechanism and, in particular, the response to morphine, and according to the presumed central or peripheral mechanism of the drugs. In reality, peripherally acting drugs can also have a central mechanism of action, just as drugs known to have a central mechanism of action can also have peripheral activity. As a result, several therapeutic classes have been identified. Firstly NSAIDs, which act by inhibiting the enzymes that synthesise prostaglandins, cyclooxygenases (COX-1, COX-2), but which also act upon lipo-oxygenases: Their efficacy is interesting, although somewhat limited by both their ceiling effect and the frequent adverse gastrointestinal reactions they produce. Specific inhibitors of COX-2 could well reduce the risk of adverse effects. Opioids constitute the first-line treatment for pain, particularly severe pain. There are several classifications for these drugs. Firstly, weak opioids (such as codeine) and strong opioids (such as morphine) are differentiated. Secondly, a distinction is made between pure agonists (such as morphine), partial agonists (such as buprenorphine), agonist-antagonists (such as nalbuphine) and antagonists (such as naloxone). Finally, agents are distinguished on the basis of their chemical structure (synthetic, semi-synthetic or natural derivatives). These molecules act upon different receptors (mu, delta, kappa, sigma) and, although peripheral mechanisms have been described, their activity occurs mainly at spinal and supraspinal levels. They provide a potent analgesic effect but are also responsible for various adverse effects-nausea, vomiting, sedation, constipation and respiratory depression-which seriously limit their use. As long as the indication is appropriate, these drugs should not be withheld because of fear of dependence or abuse. It has been observed that other adjuvant therapeutic approaches, generally used to treat conditions other than pain, provide pain relief in certain situations. These include corticosteroids, which are-widely used in rheumatology and oncology, and antidepressants, which are frequently used to treat chronic pain, especially that with a neuropathic component. Anti-epileptics are also used, particularly for excrutiating",E,E
9190322,[Tramadol in acute pain].,"Acute Disease; Adult; Analgesia, Patient-Controlled; Analgesics, Opioid; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Injections, Intramuscular; Pain; Pain, Postoperative; Tramadol","Lehmann, K A","Tramadol has been in clinical use in Germany since the late 1970s and has proven effective in both experimental and clinical pain without causing serious cardiovascular or respiratory side effects. Moreover, the negligible abuse potential of tramadol has meant that it has never been a restricted drug, and it therefore very quickly became the most popular analgesic of its class in Germany. Although tramadol has been used in myocardial emergencies, in trauma and obstetric pain, or to supplement balanced anaesthesia, most studies have investigated postoperative patients. The focus of this article is to review clinical experience with tramadol in the treatment of acute postoperative pain. Tramadol, a synthetic opioid of the aminocyclohexanol group, is a centrally acting analgesic with weak opioid agonist properties, and effects on noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. In addition, these opioid and nonopioid modes of action appear to act synergistically. Tramadol has been shown to provide effective analgesia after both intramuscular and intravenous administration for the treatment of postoperative pain. The drug is available in formulations suitable for oral, rectal and parenteral administration. Clinically effective analgesic doses of tramadol were comparable to those of pethidine (meperidine) and about 10 times higher than those of morphine. While it is not recommended as a supplement to general anaesthesia because of its insufficient sedative activity, tramadol has been successful in the treatment of postoperative pain. A randomised double-blind study reported acceptable analgesia with postoperative intravenous tramadol 50mg, repeated once if required after 30 minutes. It produced an effect similar to that of morphine 5mg or the alpha 2 agonist, clonidine 150 micrograms. In another study, it was shown that the 50mg dose of tramadol fulfilled the requirements of an analgesic for the treatment of moderate postoperative pain, whereas for severe pain a higher dose was recommended. Tramadol is generally well tolerated, the most common adverse events being nausea and vomiting. In contrast to agents such as morphine and pethidine, clinically relevant respiratory depression is rarely observed during tramadol administration at equipotent doses and consequently it can be recommended for first-line management of postoperative pain instead of morphine. It is also associated with a low incidence of cardiac depression and significantly less dizziness and drowsiness than morphine. Finally, the dependence and abuse potential with tramadol is negligible. Comparative studies have generally shown that tramadol is more effective than NSAIDs for controlling post operative pain. Use of a combination of tramadol and NSAIDs allows the tramadol dose to be reduced and results in a lower incidence of adverse effects. Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with tramadol has been frequently used and is well accepted by patients. Wide individual variations exist with regard to analgesic requirements and, nowadays, it is generally accepted that adequate pain management implies systematic individualisation of the therapy, i.e. titration of the analgesic effect to individual needs. Demand and loading doses play a decisive role in the success of PCA. Analgesic failures requiring rescue medication are rare, but it should be stressed that these can always occur with weak opioids. In conclusion, tramadol can be recommended as a basic analgesic for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. In the event of analgesic failure with tramadol, there is no reason not to switch to more potent opioids. Although no studies are available regarding its use in the management of postoperative pain after day case surgery, tramadol is frequently administered with good results in such patients. The most important side effects of tramadol are nausea and emesis, which can often be prevented by slow injection and administration of a prophylactic antiemetic such as metoclopramid",E,E

Results of an open pilot study versus clomipramine with or without levomepromazine].,"Aged; Analgesics, Opioid; Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic; Antipsychotic Agents; Clomipramine; Drug Therapy, Combination; Herpes Zoster; Humans; Methotrimeprazine; Neuralgia; Pilot Projects; Tramadol","G枚bel, H; Stadler, T","To date, no universally applicable recommendations are available for the treatment of patients with postherpetic neuralgia. A mixture of clinical anecdotes, experimental findings and observations from clinical trials form the basis of the medical arsenal for this condition. Tricyclic antidepressants are commonly used, and clinical experience and several investigations have documented their effectiveness. Today, single entity antidepressants, which can be combined with neuroleptics to increase analgesia, are generally recommended for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. Some authors also recommend the additional administration of an opioid if analgesia is inadequate. Just over a decade ago, opioids were considered ineffective for the treatment of neuropathic pain; however, more recent investigations relating to the use of opioids, primarily in the treatment of nontumour-related chronic pain, have led to a revision of their use in neuropathic pain. Nevertheless, the use of opioid therapy for neurogenic pain remains controversial. Tramadol is a synthetic, centrally acting analgesic with both opioid and nonopioid analgesic activity. The nonopioid component is related to the inhibition of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake and stimulation of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) release at the spinal level. In this regard, there are parallels with antidepressants, which are believed to potentiate the effect of biogenic amines in endogenous pain-relieving systems. There is evidence that, in tramadol, both mechanisms act synergistically with respect to analgesia. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate, for the first time, the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of tramadol, compared with the antidepressant clomipramine, in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. If necessary, clomipramine was used in combination with the neuroleptic levomepromazine. The study allowed individualised dosages at predetermined intervals up to a maximum daily dose of tramadol 600mg and clomipramine 100mg, or clomipramine 100mg with or without levomepromazine 100mg. 21 (60%) of 35 randomised patients (> or = 65 years) received the study medication over the 6-week period [tramadol n = 10; clomipramine with or without levomepromazine) n = 11]. After 3 weeks' treatment the dosage in both groups remained almost constant for the rest of the 6-week treatment phase (mean daily dose: tramadol 250 to 290mg; clomipramine 59.1 to 63.6mg). Only 3 patients required the combination of clomipramine and levomepromazine. At the outset, both groups recorded an average pain level of 'moderate' to 'very severe'. In correlation with increasing the study medication, this had decreased to 'slight' by the end of the treatment, when 9 of 10 patients in the tramadol group and of 6 of 11 patients in the clomipramine group retrospectively rated their analgesia as excellent, good or satisfactory. The psychological/physical condition of the patients did not change significantly during tramadol treatment. Sensitivity and depression parameters decreased in the clomipramine group. The incidence of adverse events for all patients was similar in both groups (tramadol 76.5%; clomipramine with or without levomepromazine 83.3%). In conclusion, tramadol would appear to be an interesting therapeutic alternative for pain relief in postherpetic neuralgia, particularly in patients who are not depressed. In clinical practice, tramadol and clomipramine can best be used differentially. For example, tramadol could be the drug of first choice in patients with obvious cardiovascular disease (not an uncommon problem in the > or = 65 year age group) in whom antidepressants are contraindicated, and similarly in patients in whom an antidepressant effect is not required.

A comparative study with respect to buprenorphine].,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analgesics, Opioid; Analysis of Variance; Buprenorphine; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Pain; Tramadol","Bono, A V; Cuffari, S","Opioid analgesics represent one of the most important tools in a sequential pharmacological approach to oncological pain relief. They are recommended by the WHO when nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) no longer provide adequate analgesia. However, the use of opioids is limited because of their numerous and often severe adverse effects. This aspect of opioids has motivated continuous research projects aimed at discovering drugs that can provide maximum pain relief but with improved tolerability. Tramadol is a new, centrally acting analgesic with a dual mechanism of action. It shows a selective interaction with mu receptors, which are responsible for nociception, and has weak pharmacodynamic activity on other opioid receptors. At the same time, it acts synergistically on neuroamine transmission by inhibiting synaptic noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake and inducing intrasynaptic serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) release. From a pharmacokinetic standpoint, tramadol offers high bioavailability, with similar patterns after oral or parenteral administration (half-life 5 to 7 hours, time to peak plasma concentration 3.1 hours, and approximately 20% plasma protein binding). Although the efficacy of tramadol is comparable to that of other drugs with similar modes of action, the incidence of side effects such as constipation and respiratory depression is lower. The frequency of euphoria and dysphoria is negligible, resulting in little risk of abuse or dependence. It therefore seemed appropriate to further investigate the efficacy and tolerability of tramadol, defined as having only weak potency, in comparison with a widely used opioid, in oncological pain. Buprenorphine was selected as an opioid with a potency equivalent to half that of morphine, but with tolerability that is partially limited by the fact that it frequently gives rise to adverse reactions considered typical of stronger opioids. To compare the analgesic effect and tolerability of tramadol and buprenorphine, 60 patients (44 men, 16 women; average age 61.4 years), all presenting with advanced tumours, were treated orally in a controlled crossover trial with randomised sequences. Patients took both drugs, each for a week, with a 24-hour washout period between treatments. Tramadol was prescribed at the daily dose of 300mg, orally, and buprenorphine at 0.6 mg/day, as a sublingual preparation. Assessments were made of Karnofsky performance status and severity of pain before and during the 4 hours after taking the 2 drugs. Each patient also completed a daily diary recording the severity of pain 1 hour after the dose, the evolution of pain during the day and its severity compared with that on the previous day. They also assessed the duration and quality of sleep. The Karnofsky index changed little with either treatment, but all other variables showed worthwhile improvement, indicating the significant analgesic effect of both drugs. Buprenorphine and tramadol had a similar analgesic effect, although the improvement with the test drug was significant within 1 hour of administration (p < 0.05 compared with baseline) and more marked (p < 0.05 on day 2 compared with buprenorpine). At the end of tramadol treatment, sleep had also improved, both quantitatively and qualitatively (both p < 0.05). The final assessment was significantly in favour of tramadol as regards efficacy (p < 0.05) and patient acceptability (p < 0.01). Thus, tramadol was better tolerated than buprenorphine, and caused fewer and milder adverse reactions. Only 1 patient discontinued tramadol, compared with 18 using reference therapy. Tramadol, although theoretically less potent, nevertheless brought about as much pain relief as the comparator opioid. In conclusion, for this class of drug, tramadol provides an excellent balance between efficacy and tolerability, confirming preliminary studies.",E,E

Chronic pancreatitis is a risk factor for development of pancreatic carcinoma, and carcinomas may present, initially with a clinical picture of chronic pancreatitis. Local complications of chronic pancreatitis such as common bile duct or duodenal obstruction and enlarging or symptomatic pseudocyst also mandate surgical intervention. Thrombosis of the splenic vein with left-sided portal hypertension is common and associated with a 10% incidence of gastric variceal hemorrhage, which requires splenectomy. The role of surgery in the management of pain associated with chronic pancreatitis is to provide relief. When the pain interferes substantially with the patient's quality of life or narcotics are required for pain relief, surgical intervention is indicated. Other factors that should be incorporated in assessing the need for surgical intervention are malnutrition due to the inability to eat or malabsorption, the need for frequent hospitalization, and the inability to work. The operation selected for chronic pancreatitis should correct or deal with all structural abnormalities, provide long-term pain relief, have a low mortality and morbidity rate, minimize subsequent exocrine and endocrine insufficiency, and have results independent of abstinence from alcohol. No single operation can provide an optimal solution to the management of pain or these diverse complications of chronic pancreatitis.

Based on those findings, a definitive trial was performed to assess the effectiveness of gemcitabine in patients with newly diagnosed advanced pancreas cancer.; One hundred twenty-six patients with advanced symptomatic pancreas cancer completed a lead-in period to characterize and stabilize pain and were randomized to receive either gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 weekly x 7 followed by 1 week of rest, then weekly x 3 every 4 weeks thereafter (63 patients), or to fluorouracil (5-FU) 600 mg/m2 once weekly (63 patients). The primary efficacy measure was clinical benefit response, which was a composite of measurements of pain (analgesic consumption and pain intensity), Karnofsky performance status, and weight. Clinical benefit required a sustained (> or = 4 weeks) improvement in at least one parameter without worsening in any others. Other measures of efficacy included response rate, time to progressive disease, and survival.; Clinical benefit response was experienced by 23.8% of gemcitabine-treated patients compared with 4.8% of 5-FU-treated patients (P = .0022). The median survival durations were 5.65 and 4.41 months for gemcitabine-treated and 5-FU-treated patients, respectively (P = .0025). The survival rate at 12 months was 18% for gemcitabine patients and 2% for 5-FU patients. Treatment was well tolerated.; This study demonstrates that gemcitabine is more effective than 5-FU in alleviation of some disease-related symptoms in patients with advanced, symptomatic pancreas cancer. Gemcitabine also confers a modest survival advantage over treatment with 5-FU.",E,E

Amitriptyline recently was shown to antagonize N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and in this study, the authors sought to determine the effect of amitriptyline alone and with the opioid alfentanil on hyperalgesia and allodynia produced by intradermal injection of capsaicin.; Forty-six healthy volunteers in the general clinical research center received repeated intradermal injections of capsaicin (100 microg) alone or before and after systemic injection of 4 mg midazolam, 25 mg amitriptyline, alfentanil by computer-controlled infusion, or amitriptyline plus alfentanil. Acute pain and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia were determined at specified intervals. Blood was obtained for alfentanil and amitriptyline assay.; Capsaicin injection produced acute pain followed by hyperalgesia and allodynia. Alfentanil reduced these pain responses in a plasma-concentration-dependent manner, and reduction in hyperalgesia and allodynia correlated with reduction in acute pain. Amitriptyline alone had no effect and did not potentiate alfentanil. Alfentanil produced concentration-dependent nausea, an effect diminished by amitriptyline.; These data correspond with previous studies in volunteers demonstrating reduction in hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal injection of capsaicin by systemically administered opioids, and they suggest that this reduction may be secondary to reduced nociceptive input by acute analgesia. These data do not support the use of acute systemic administration of amitriptyline for acute pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia, although the roles of chronic treatment and spinal administration are being investigated.",E,E

The present study was aimed to investigate the antinociceptive effects of the new kappa-opioid receptor agonist RP 60180. An experimental pain model was used based on specific pain stimuli and event-related potentials. Effects of RP 60180 were compared to placebo and to pentazocine that served as positive control. Twenty healthy male volunteers participated in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, five-way cross-over study. Single peroral doses of RP 60180 (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg), pentazocine (50 mg), and placebo were administered. Pain was induced by means of short pulses of gaseous CO2 applied to the nasal mucosa. In response to these stimuli, chemo-somatosensory event-related potentials (CSSERP) and pain ratings were recorded. Maximum antinociceptive effects were observed 2 h after the administration of 1.0 mg of RP 60180 and 50 mg of pentazocine. This was shortly after RP 60180 had reached the maximum plasma concentration and when highest plasma concentrations of pentazocine were measured. Both RP 60180 and pentazocine reduced pain-related CSSERP amplitudes by approximately 40% at this time. Pentazocine tended to produce more side effects. These results indicate the potential therapeutic value of kappa-agonist analgesics.",E,E

Since benzodiazepines enhance the action of GABA at GABAA receptors, we hypothesized that administration of these agents for preoperative sedation might antagonize the analgesic effects of opioids administered postoperatively. If so, then administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil should enhance postoperative morphine analgesia. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients who received a preoperatively administered benzodiazepine (diazepam) for sedation and a postoperatively administered opioid (morphine) for analgesia, we investigated opioid-benzodiazepine interactions affecting postoperative dental pain. We found that flumazenil significantly enhanced morphine analgesia consistent with the hypothesis that the preoperatively administered benzodiazepine exerts an ongoing antianalgesic effect. In addition, we followed these patients over the first and second postoperative days to determine if there were differences between the drug groups in post-discharge pain, analgesic consumption, or side-effects. Participants receiving flumazenil reported significantly less post-discharge nausea and used significantly less ibuprofen. Since post-discharge pain levels were not significantly different, these results suggest that the patients receiving flumazenil required less analgesic medication to achieve a comparable level of pain control. In summary, our results indicate that the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil enhances morphine analgesia and decreases post-discharge side-effects as well as post-discharge need for analgesic medication.",E,E

Ten healthy male volunteers participated in four study sessions, one for each of the hydromorphone doses as well as a placebo (saline). They received the four treatments in counterbalanced order under double-blind conditions and with study days at least 1 week apart. During each session subjects underwent repeated electrical tooth pulp stimulation at intensities sufficient to elicit a rating of 'strong pain' before drug administration. Subjective pain reports (PRs) and dental evoked potential amplitude measures (EPs) served as analgesic effect indicators. We observed dose-dependent analgesia as measured by both PR (P = 0.009) and EP (P = 0.017). Area under the PR versus time curve as well as the EP versus time curve decreased in a log dose-dependent fashion. Although the peak effect was poorly defined, the onset of analgesia was rapid, within 5 min, and maximum analgesic effect was seen between 10 and 20 min after maximum plasma hydromorphone concentration. However, within sessions we found a poor correspondence between hydromorphone plasma concentration and effect. Compared to pain report data from other human studies done in our laboratory, hydromorphone has a shorter time to peak effect compared to morphine, and overall, hydromorphone hydrochloride is approximately five times as potent as morphine sulfate on a milligram basis.",E,E

The patients were assigned to two equal groups, one receiving PCA and the other pethidine (control). Patients in the PCA group self-administered varying doses of intravenous alfentanil according to their pain tolerance, while those in the control group were given a single bolus dose of 1 mg/kg body weight intravenous pethidine by the attending urologist before the start of the procedure. The stone site, maximum energy level achieved, number of shock waves given, duration of procedure, pain scores, patient tolerance and acceptance were recorded to assess the efficacy of PCA compared with analgesia controlled by the physician.; Both groups were matched for age, body weight, stone location and number of shocks given. The PCA group received a mean of 1.03 mg alfentanil while the control group received a mean of 62.5 mg pethidine. The maximum discharge voltage of 16 kV was achieved in all but one patient (98%) in the PCA group whereas only 21 patients (42%) in the control group attained this level. The mean treatment duration was less in the PCA group (32.8 min) than in the control group (44.5 min), the mean pain score lower (3.76 and 4.62, respectively) and the incidence of nausea and vomiting much less (22% and 60%, respectively). In addition, all 21 patients in the PCA group who had received intravenous pethidine during previous sessions of ESWL chose PCA as the better form of analgesia. There were no adverse effects in the PCA group except for one patient whose arterial oxygen saturation decreased transiently.; PCA enables the urologist to achieve better patient compliance through better pain control; its application has maximized the use of lithotripsy and the patients' acceptability for this form of analgesia is confirmed. We recommend that this form of analgesia be used for ESWL.",E,E

The mean [SD] time to the first analgesic (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) administration was significantly prolonged by intrathecal neostigmine (10.7 [4.3] h) and morphine (15.3 [3.0] h) compared with saline (4.5 [1.0] h). The three groups also differed in the number of patients requiring subcutaneous morphine to complement the analgesia provided by the intramuscular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the mean [SD] times for their administration: eight patients in the saline group (8.0 [3.8] h), one patient in the morphine group (18 h) and two patients in the neostigmine group (8 and 12.9 h). The morphine and neostigmine groups showed similar analgesic effectiveness. The characteristics of spinal anaesthesia were not modified by intrathecal morphine or neostigmine. Severe nausea and vomiting, sweating and distress during surgery were the most obvious adverse effects of intrathecal neostigmine. On the other hand, less hypotension was observed in the neostigmine group. The usefulness of intrathecal neostigmine as the sole postoperative analgesic may be restricted by the severity of its adverse effects.",E,E

From experimental neurophysiological data, the present policy of preventive analgesia aims at precluding modifications of the nervous system secondary to a nervous lesion and the appearance of chronic pain, particularly of the neurogenic kind. The post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) falls within the realm of neurogenic pain and is still poorly understood and underestimated. This study evaluated the preemptive effect of a perioperative administration of an oral non steroid anti-inflammatory, the ibuprofen-arginine, on PMPS. Thirty patients scheduled for partial or total mastectomy with axillary dissection were prospectively and randomly assigned to 2 groups. The ibuprofen-arginine group (group I) (n = 15), received an oral administration of 400 mg of ibuprofen-arginine, 90 min before surgery, 2 h after surgery and then every 8 h in the first 32 postoperative hours. The control group (group C) received in doubled blind a placebo at the same time. At 6 months, we looked after pain or dysesthesia. We confirmed the diagnosis of PMPS in presence of association of diagnosis criterias. Fourteen patients in each group have been included. Eighty-six percent of the patients (13 patients in group I and 11 patients in group C) presented at 6 months dysesthesia of the upper member ipsilateral to the mastectomy and/or the operated breast, appearing either immediately or after a laps of time. Nine patients (group I) and 6 patients (group C) had PMPS. Postoperative radiotherapy and lymphoedema were statistically associated with PMPS (p = 0.019 and p = 0.011). The perioperative preventive administration of a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug reduces neither the incidence of pain in the first post-operative months, nor the appearance of PMPS at 6 months. These results suggest that others factors than the nervous lesion may play a role in the occurrence of PMPS, as radiotherapy, lymphoedema, but also psychosocials factors.",E,E

Oral MHIR was provided as rescue medication for breakthrough pain. Assessments of the pain intensity, pain frequency, degree of pain improvement, profile of mood states, quality of sleep, activity status and adverse effects were performed before and after the stabilization phase and before and after the treatment phase.; Forty of 47 cancer patients completed the study with 20 patients in each group. There were significant (p < 0.05) improvements in pain intensity, pain frequency, mood states and quality of sleep in both groups before and after treatment, while improvement in the activity status was not significant. No specific adverse effects were encountered except for drowsiness which occurred in 6 patients treated with MST and 5 treated with TDF (p < 0.05). Insomnia was significantly improved (p < 0.05) with both regimens compared with that in the period before treatment. There were no significant differences between the two study groups in analgesic efficacy or adverse effects.; These results suggest that TDF and MSt are safe and effective analgesics for the management of chronic cancer pain.

Effective intrathecal analgesia can be achieved through synergism of low doses of the two analgesic drugs and, possibly, less drug-related adverse effects. Therefore, we have evaluated the usefulness of a combined low-dose bupivacaine and morphine infusion in patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty. Spinal anaesthesia was induced in 55 ASA I-III patients with 0.5% bupivacaine 2 ml via a 28-gauge spinal catheter (L3-4 interspace) and 0.5-ml increments were given if needed. Intrathecal 24-h infusions consisted of bupivacaine 2 mg h-1 alone (n = 18), bupivacaine 1 mg h-1 alone (n = 18) or bupivacaine 1 mg h-1 combined with morphine 8 micrograms h-1 (n = 19). The interview after 3, 6, 12 and 24 h included assessment of pain at rest and on movement (VAS scale), occurrence of sensory and motor block and nausea/vomiting. Bupivacaine 1 mg h-1 combined with an infusion of morphine provided as good postoperative analgesia as bupivacaine 2 mg h-1, but motor block disappeared earlier (P = 0.01). Patients in the bupivacaine 1-mg h-1 group required more supplementary doses of oxycodone i.m. than the other groups (P = 0.04). Time to first oxycodone dose from the start of intrathecal infusion did not differ between groups. The frequency of nausea and vomiting was similar in all groups. In spite of this, antiemetic medication was required more often in the bupivacaine 1-mg h-1 group (possible because of opioid rescue medication). On the ward, one patient in the bupivacaine 2-mg h-1 group experienced a new increase in sensory block with concomitant hypotension. One patient in the same group had minor decubitus on the heel of the operated leg, probably because of prolonged motor block. We conclude that intrathecal infusion of a combination of bupivacaine 1 mg h-1 and morphine 8 micrograms h-1 produced adequate postoperative analgesia. Unfortunately, postoperative nausea and vomiting was a frequent disturbing adverse effect.",E,E

In the United States, available drug treatments for chronic pain currently include simple analgesics such as acetaminophen, salicylates and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, traditional opioid drugs, and adjuvant agents (eg, antidepressants, anticonvulsants). Typically, the choice of a drug is made by balancing the indications for treatment, the clinical efficacy of the drug, and its toxicity. An understanding of the mechanism of action of these drugs helps to establish their role in therapy. Tramadol is an effective analgesic that works through a combined mechanism of weak mu receptor binding and the inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tramadol has a favorable adverse-effect profile and therefore is likely to have an important role in the management of chronic pain syndromes.",3,E

MPC patients required significantly longer periods of time to meet discharge criteria than fentanyl and fentanyl-midazolam patients (P < 0.05). No differences were noted in peak pain, anxiety, or sedation scores.; Fentanyl, fentanyl-midazolam, and MPC produced a high incidence of subclinical respiratory depression. End-tidal CO2 monitoring provided an earlier indication of respiratory depression than pulse oximetry and respiratory rate alone.

Thirteen subjects with no history of opiate dependence participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial in which each subject received saline, 2 mg/70 kg butorphanol, and 10 mg/70 kg morphine, IV, in each of two conditions, periodic forearm immersions into either ice-cold water (2 degrees C) or into warm water (37 degrees C). Both opioids reduced self-reported ratings of pain intensity, indicative of analgesia. Several of the subjective effects of morphine were attenuated either during or in between cold-water immersions, including visual analog scale ratings of ""coasting (spaced out),"" ""high (drug ""high""),"" ""sleepy (drowsy, tired),"" and ""lightheaded"". In contrast, some of butorphanol's subjective effects were increased by the cold-water manipulation. Morphine impaired psychomotor performance during one of the warm-water immersions, but not during the cold-water immersions. Psychomotor impairment induced by butorphanol was not affected by water temperature. This study provides evidence that opioid effects can be modulated by a painful stimulus in humans.",E,E

This paper introduces statistical pattern visualization methodology for the study of complex individual differences in clinical settings. We demonstrate the application of such methods in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and suffering severe oral mucositis as a consequence of the aggressive BMT preparative regimen. Oral mucositis produces severe pain and patients often require parenteral opioid medication for several weeks. Unfortunately, the opioid can cause side-effects that limit drug use for pain control. Patients differ in severity and duration of oral mucositis, analgesic response to opioids, and side-effects. We identified and classified individual differences in patterns of drug use, pain control and side-effects in 33 BMT patients who received opioid drug via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) systems for 7 days or more. These systems allowed bolus dosing and also provided a basic level of analgesic protection through continuous drug infusion. Continuous infusion levels increased or decreased in response to patient bolus self-administration. We employed statistical smoothing (moving average) techniques to remove random variation from the individual data sets and created three-way (trivariate) plots of change over time in drug use, pain and an opioid side-effect (impairment of concentration). The patterns apparent in these plots indicated that 24.2% of patients used PCA optimally (increases in drug use associated with reductions in pain and little or no side-effect), an additional 30.3% manifested a potentially optimal pattern limited by side-effect that worsened with dosing, and 36.4% used PCA suboptimally (modest pain control plus side-effects). In addition, for each subject we created a summary measure for the simultaneous change in three variables: the distance of each day's trivariate score from the origin of a three dimensional plot. This summary measure correlated significantly with the changing severity of patients' oral mucositis over time (r = 0.502). This study demonstrates how interactive graphic techniques can provide a basis for examining changes over time among multiple, correlated variables associated with a single individual. It illustrates the application of such techniques and demonstrates that individual subject data sets merit examination in cases where clinical data reflect human performance.",E,E

Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: remifentanil, 1 microgram/kg, given over 30 s followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (remifentanil), remifentanil, 0.5 microgram/kg, given over 30 s followed by a continuous infusion of 0.05 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (remifentanil+midazolam). Five minutes after the start of the infusion, patients received a loading dose of saline placebo (remifentanil) or midazolam, 1 mg, (remifentanil+midazolam). If patients were not oversedated, a second dose of placebo or midazolam, 1 mg, was given. Remifentanil was titrated (in increments of 50% from the initial rate) to limit patient discomfort or pain intraoperatively, and the infusion was terminated at the completion of skin closure.; At the time of the local anesthetic, most patients in the remifentanil and remifentanil+midazolam groups experienced no pain (66% and 60%, respectively) and no discomfort (66% and 65%, respectively). The final mean (+/-SD) remifentanil infusion rates were 0.12 +/- 0.05 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (remifentanil) and 0.07 +/- 0.03 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (remifentanil+midazolam).

The recent development with regard to the pain modulatory effects of adenosine, primarily in clinical studies, has generated a renewed interest in this principle for pain control. This review summarizes the current knowledge in adenosine mediated pain modulation in acute and chronic conditions, with focus on studies in man. The endogenous compound adenosine has various modulatory effects in the peripheral and central nervous system, mediated through specific cell-surface associated receptors. The current view is that adenosine receptors of the A1-subtype are associated with a modulatory effect on pain transmission at spinal cord level. Animal studies have repeatedly demonstrated adenosine- and adenosine analog mediated inhibitory influences on presumed nociceptive reflex responses (1,2). These examinations in rodents have tested acute pain models involving tactile, pressure and heat stimulations. More recently, animal lesion models presumably reflecting chronic pain, has shown that adenosine analogs can suppress nociceptive behaviour both by systemic and intrathecal (i.t.) administration (3,4). Consequently, there is substantial evidence that adenosine can modulate nociceptive input. Further, it has been proposed that endogenous adenosine formation is involved in physiological pain control at the spinal cord level and that its release is involved in the action of opioid antinociception (1). Clinical studies have revealed that adenosine administration by bolus injection or by infusion at doses above 70 micrograms x kg-1 x min-1 is associated with pain symptoms from different parts of the body. This algogenic effect of higher doses of adenosine is probably related to sensitization/activation of peripheral nociceptive afferents (5).",E,E

It is concluded that intra-operative high dose alfentanil anaesthetic pre-empts post-operative pain after abdominal hysterectomy, but the effects are small and of short duration. Surgical procedures carried out under general anaesthesia using standard (and even high) doses of opioids intraoperatively provide suboptimal protection from the injury barrage brought about by incision and subsequent noxious surgical events.",E,E

This study compared the effect of four different additives to prilocaine with saline on the development of a complete sensory block, on the return of sensory function after deflation of the tourniquet and on the development of postoperative pain after IVRA for minor orthopedic surgery of the arm. Seventy-five patients, ASA class 1 or 2, were randomly divided into 5 groups. All patients received 30 ml. of prilocaine 1%, together with 5 ml. of additive. In group 1, the additive was saline, in group 2 bupivacaine 0.25%, in group 3 clonidine 150 micrograms in saline, in group 4 sufentanil 25 micrograms in saline and in group 5 tenoxicam 20 mg. The development of a complete sensory block proved significantly faster in the patients receiving sufentanil (4.8 min.) as compared to plain prilocaine (7.5 min.). The return of the sensory function was comparable for all groups. Postoperative pain scores were significantly better in the clonidine and tenoxicam groups.",E,E

It is an invasive technique not free from adverse effects. Two chronic pain patients received an implantable Synchromed pump for treatment with spinal opiates after a trial period of resp. 3.5 and 5.5 months. Due to a misprogrammation (both on the same day) they received very high doses of spinal opiates. This caused relatively few side effects, which did not seem to require immediate treatment. A short time development of tolerance to life threatening side-effects has been proven by this accidental administration of high-dose intraspinal opiates. It is critical that care providers are knowledgeable and well-trained about implantable infusion systems. Programmation and refills must always be performed with care.",E,E

We conducted a prospective randomized study to compare the effect of fentanyl administered either through a PCA delivery system or by a physician. Thirty-nine women were randomized to PCA during egg collection while 42 were allocated to receive intermittent doses administered by a physician. Pain was evaluated by means of a 100 mm linear analogue scale. The mean (SD) pain score in the PCA group was 38.5 (19.8) while in the other group it was 46.1 (21.3) (P = 0.1). In the PCA group, 64% of women felt very satisfied with their analgesia as compared with 57% in the non-PCA group (P = 0.6). Among the PCA users, 39% of demands were successful. Significantly more fentanyl (97.5 microg) was used in the PCA group than in the other group (84.6 microg) (P = 0.03).

As outlined in this article, a three-step approach is recommended depending on the severity of pain. The three-step approach utilizes a combination of NSAIDs, oral or intravenous opioids. In addition to selecting a particular opioid to use, the practitioner must also consider the route of administration and the mode of administration. All three choices may significantly impact on the efficacy of analgesia. While we continue to use primarily intravenous opioids to treat moderate and severe pain in the hospital setting, future formulations and developments may allow for the increased use of non-parenteral routes.",E,E

In a prospective, double-blind, randomized fashion, 105 patients undergoing TKA were divided into the following 4 groups defined by the intra-articular injection they received: group 1 (n = 27) received saline solution, group 2 (n = 26) received morphine sulfate (5 mg), group 3 (n = 24) received bupivacaine (50 mg), and group 4 (n = 28) received a combination of morphine sulfate and bupivacaine. The injections were administered immediately after wound closure by the Hemovac drainage tubing that remained clamped for 45 minutes after surgery to allow for absorption. Before surgery and at 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 hours after surgery, pain intensity was recorded using a visual analog scale. Postoperative supplemental intravenous morphine and/or meperidine was administered via a patient-controlled analgesia device, and 24-hour drug usage was tabulated. Results were suggestive of a modest short-term reduction in pain scores in the morphine and bupivacaine treatment groups compared with placebo (saline); however, results were statistically significant only at 4 hours because of the great variability in the pain score data. The total amount of postoperative pain medication used in the first 24 hours after surgery was not statistically significant between the 4 treatment groups. Thus, the results put into question the benefit of postoperative intra-articular administration of morphine or bupivacaine in patients undergoing TKA.",E,E

In addition, the correlation between the pharmacological characteristics and the effects of chronic motor cortex stimulation therapy was examined. The study employed 39 central post-stroke pain patients who had intractable hemibody pain associated with dysesthesias, and radiologically demonstrated lesions in the thalamic area (thalamic pain, n = 25) or suprathalamic area (suprathalamic pain, n = 14). The pharmacological evaluations showed that definite pain reduction occurred in eight of the 39 cases (20.5%) by the morphine test, in 22 of the 39 cases (56.4%) by the thiamylal test, and in 11 of 23 cases (47.8%) by the ketamine test. Based on these pharmacological assessments, there was no obvious difference between thalamic and suprathalamic pain. A comparison of the long-term follow-up results of chronic motor cortex stimulation therapy revealed that thiamylal and ketamine-sensitive and morphine-resistant cases displayed long-lasting pain reduction with chronic motor cortex stimulation therapy, whereas the remaining cases did not show good results. We conclude that pharmacological classification of central post-stroke pain by the morphine, thiamylal and ketamine tests could be useful for predicting the effects of chronic motor cortex stimulation therapy. It has recently been suggested that excitatory amino acids may be involved in the development of central post-stroke pain. However, the fact that only 23 of the present 39 cases (59.0%) of thalamic and suprathalamic pain were sensitive to the thiamylal or ketamine test reflects the complex pharmacological background and the difficulties associated with treating central post-stroke pain.",E,E

Hyperalgesia was produced by a local 1 degree burn injury covering 12.5 cm2 on the medial surface of the calf. Primary hyperalgesia was determined by measuring heat pain detection threshold (HPDT) within the site of injury. Spatial aspects of secondary hyperalgesia present outside the site of injury were quantitated by determination of the areas in which a mechanical punctate (von Frey hair, 50.6 mN), or brush stimuli elicited pain sensation. Temporal aspects of secondary hyperalgesia were determined by repetitively pricking the skin with a standard von Frey hair (834 mN) inducing a 'wind-up-like pain'. Morphine 0.15 mg/kg, ketamine 0.15 mg/kg or placebo (NaCl 0.9%) were administrated i.v. on 3 separate days 50 min after the burn injury in a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomised and cross-over design. In all subjects HPDT was significantly reduced within the injured area compared to the pre-injury threshold (primary hyperalgesia). All subjects developed areas of allodynia and hyperalgesia to punctate stimuli and brush stimuli outside the injured area (secondary hyperalgesia). HPDT was not reduced in the area of secondary hyperalgesia. In 95% of the measurements we found a sudden appearance of pain to repeated pricking with a von Frey hair (834 mN) in the area of secondary hyperalgesia ('wind-up-like pain'). Ketamine significantly reduced the area of secondary hyperalgesia both for punctate and brush stimuli in the first measurement 15 min after injection and eight of the 11 subjects reported that the 'wind-up-like pain' disappeared. On the measurements 45 and 75 min after ketamine injection, secondary hyperalgesia and 'wind-up-like pain' reappeared. Morphine did not significantly change the size of the area of secondary hyperalgesia and did not affect 'wind-up-like pain'. Ketamine or morphine did not change thermal detection thresholds. We conclude that spatial and temporal mechanisms, underlying secondary hyperalgesia, are mediated by glutamatergic transmission via NMDA receptors.",E,E

Results showed that, as predicted, disruption of attentional performance was most pronounced in those who reported high pain intensity and high somatic awareness. Further analysis revealed that these patients also reported high negative affect. These findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical implications for the concept of hypervigilance and their clinical implications for chronic pain control.",E,E

This study compared the pain experience, adequacy of pain management and psychological well-being among patients with AIDS who reported a history of injection drug use (IDU) as their HIV transmission risk factor and patients with other HIV transmission risk factors. Five hundred and sixteen ambulatory AIDS patients participating in a quality of life study completed a series of self-report instruments including the Brief Pain Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Brief Symptom Inventory, the Functional Living Inventory and the Social Support Questionnaire. Results demonstrated that IDU and non-IDU subjects did not differ significantly in their report of pain prevalence, pain intensity or pain-related functional interference. However, IDU patients were significantly more likely to receive inadequate analgesic medications, reported lower levels of pain relief and a greater degree of psychological distress. There was also no difference in report of pain intensity, pain relief or functional interference among patients who acknowledged continued drug use, those who denied any recent drug use and patients participating in a methadone maintenance program. These data support the validity of AIDS patients' report of pain, at least in research settings, and suggest that undertreatment of pain is not restricted to patients who actively abuse drugs.",E,E

Whereas this interaction can be explained by induction of phase I drug metabolism (CYP3A4), knowledge about induction of phase II metabolism (e.g., UDP-glucuronosyltransferases = UGTs) and its influence on drug effects in man, however, is very limited. The potent analgesic morphine is metabolized by more than one UGT to the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide and to morphine-3-glucuronide, which is devoid of analgesic activity. Thus, differential induction of UGTs involved in metabolism of morphine might lead to decreased or increased analgesic effects, depending on which UGT is preferentially induced. We therefore investigated the influence of the potent enzyme inducer rifampin on analgesic effects and pharmacokinetics of morphine, which is primarily eliminated by phase II metabolism. Ten healthy male volunteers participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study with double crossover design. Morphine (10 mg p.o.) and placebo were administered on two separate occasions before and near the end of 13 days of treatment with rifampin (600 mg/day). Blood samples were collected for 31 h. Morphine effects on pain sensation were determined using the cold pressor test. When morphine was given alone, the opioid elicited a significant increase in pain threshold and pain tolerance in comparison to placebo (P < or = 0.05). However, following administration of rifampin no analgesic effect of morphine was observed. In agreement, the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of morphine and the maximum serum concentration of morphine were considerably reduced during coadministration of rifampin (-27.7 +/- 19.3% and -40.7 +/- 27.1%; P < or = 0.01). Moreover, during treatment with rifampin a proportional reduction of AUCs of morphine-3-glucuronide (P < or = 0.01), morphine-6-glucuronide (P < or = 0.05) and morphine was observed. Since urinary recoveries of both morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide were also reduced during administration of rifampin, there is no evidence for a contribution of UGT induction to the observed interaction. In summary, a major drug interaction was observed between morphine and rifampin, which could not be attributed to induction of UGTs, but resulted in a complete loss of analgesic effects of the opioid.",E,E

Experience and treatment options.,Arm; Chronic Disease; Humans; Pain; Pain Management; Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy; Sympathetic Nervous System; Syndrome; Wounds and Injuries,"Cooney, W P","It has been helpful in our practice to separate somatic from sympathetic-mediated peripheral nerve pain. We would recommend application of the new nomenclature of type I complex regional pain (sympathetic dystrophy) and type II complex regional pain (causalgia) (see Table 1). We believe it is essential that both of these conditions be separated into their early and late phases and that the treatment alternatives be customized for the individual patient and the peripheral nerve involved. If a cast, pin, or external fixation apparatus is associated with peripheral nerve pain, the offending apparatus must be removed immediately and other forms of treatment initiated for the underlying injury. For acute injury and postsurgical pain, narcotic pain medications should be used no longer than 72 hours and careful patient re-examination must be performed if pain persists. Prescription of narcotic pain medications on a continuing basis is often the primary reason for the development of chronic pain syndromes. Physical therapy for the patient with chronic peripheral limb pain must be performed in a pain-free environment. ""No pain, no gain"" does not apply in the treatment of chronic limb pain-rather the reverse: ""Only gain with no pain."" In differentiating between sympathetic pain and somatic pain, the use of the reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) score can be helpful (Table 4). If the pain is somatic, treatment options include: Somatic Pain: Treatment Isolated nerve block Continuous nerve block TENS (external) Direct electrical nerve stimulation (internal) Nerve ablation If the pain is sympathetic in origin, treatments to be considered are: Sympathetic Nerve Pain: Treatment Protection of limb (garment or splint) Combine with active use Sympathetic blocks single continuous Sympathectomy In addition, the treatment of each of those conditions must be directed at the primary condition. Once the two conditions are separated, a careful program of pain management is required. In patients who present with late pain dysfunction, the more commonly observed phenomenon at our institution, the combination of physician, surgeon, and anesthesiologist is essential. The role of physical therapist in restoring function to the injured limb must be discussed and planned carefully. Initial pain management is organized through a qualified anesthesiologist dedicated to this field. Physical therapy follows but only in a pain-free environment. The surgeon's role is to assist and direct the pain management program. Surgeons can be involved in the placement of percutaneous catheters, as well as isolated peripheral nerve blocks. Surgical intervention is limited to the release of compressive neuropathies, nerve transfers, and revascularization of the peripheral nerve bed. The surgeon occasionally may be involved in the manipulation and pinning of contracted joints, as well as release of muscle or joint contractures, followed by a supervised program of early range of motion. Finally, it is important that both physician and surgeon serve as patient advocates when questions of workers' compensation intervene that could deter proper treatment programs or when the patient needs the encouragement and guidance to continue with treatments that don't always initially appear to have immediate results. Finally, requests to the surgeon to find an operative cure must be resisted while continued psychological encouragement is provided.",E,E

Patient-controlled analgesia or epidural analgesia was administered in a double-blind manner for a 3-day postoperative course. Each patient received both an epidural and a patient-controlled analgesia delivery system; 26 received the epidural active agent and 28 received patient-controlled analgesia. Postoperative time to liquids and solid food, ambulation, length of stay, and side effects was recorded.

Minor side effects occurred in 71% of patients in both groups. No major complications occurred. Epidural catheter dislodgment occurred in 11% of patients. The total cost for epidural analgesia was approximately $550 more than that for patient-controlled analgesia for a 3-day postoperative course.; These data suggest that there is no clinical advantage of epidural opiate/local anesthetic analgesia over systemic opiate by patient-controlled analgesia for spinal fusion patients. However, possible technical limitations (namely, the low dosage of bupivacaine and placement of the catheter tip) may have prevented adequate delivery of anesthetic to the involved segments. Although the incidence of side effects is similar, cost factors and a high incidence of epidural catheter dislodgment favor use of patient-controlled analgesia.",E,E

The survey instrument presented a typical case of otitis media complicated only by pain so severe that the patient had been unable to sleep. Physicians were asked specifically if they would prescribe an analgesic and if so what kind. Emergency and family practice physicians were presented on a random basis with cases that were identical except the age was given at two or 22 years old. Pediatricians were given only the two year old. Eighty percent (137/165) of the surveys were completed and returned. Only 28% of the physicians would prescribe medications stronger than acetaminophen or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. There was a trend toward more narcotic analgesics for the 22 year old (41 vs 22% Fisher's exact test P = 0.03). Emergency physicians were the most generous, prescribing narcotics (codeine or oxycodone compounds) half the time (50%) versus one quarter of the time (22%) for family practice physicians and pediatricians (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.01). Pediatricians and family practice physicians did not differ (20 vs. 25%, P = 0.8). Potent analgesics are rarely prescribed by our sample physicians. Children are somewhat less likely to receive narcotics than adults with the same complaint. Emergency physicians are more likely to prescribe potent analgesics than are family practice physicians or pediatricians.",E,E

Clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, has been reported to provide [corrected] pain relief by epidural administration. Furthermore, epidural clonidine has been shown to potentiate the analgesic effect of epidural morphine. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the analgesic and side effects of epidural administration (Ep) of butorphanol and clonidine.; After giving their consents, 60 adult patients scheduled for abdominal surgeries were enrolled in this study. Prior to anesthesia induction, indwelling lumbar epidural catheters were placed in all patients who then received general anesthesia with inhalation anesthetic without narcotic analgesics. In the postoperative period, when the patients first complained of pain, they were divided into 2 equal groups of 30 patients each in a randomized and double blinded fashion with Group I receiving Ep butorphanol 0.5 mg and Group II receiving Ep butorphanol 0.5 mg plus clonidine 75 micrograms. All patients were observed for pain relief, sedation, vital signs, arterial blood gas studies and adverse effects for 12 h.; Onset of pain relief with epidural butorphanol began at 5 min and peaked at 20-30 min with a duration of action lasting 4-6 h. The combination of butorphanol and clonidine had numerically superior pain relief than that of butorphanol for the first 30 min but it did not attain statistical significant difference. The duration of action with the combination group was similar to that of butorphanol alone. Incidence of adverse effects were similar in both groups except that hypotension and more pronounced sedation were observed in Group II.; Our study showed that the addition of clonidine to epidural butorphanol did not enhance its analgesic effect in any significant manner nor did it reduce the adverse effects. This combination does not seem to offer any advantage for clinical use.",E,E

Many patients with severe CNMBP suffer not because their pain is untreatable but because their pain and personhood have not been validated by doctors and nurses who are opioiphobic. Such ignorances fears, beliefs and biases not only deny some CNMBP patients adequate pain relief but also puts their lives at risk as it has long been recognised that chronic pain can lead to immunosuppression, affecting morbidity and mortality. Beyond the effects on patients, CNMBP treated with long term opioids (LTO) has a profound impact on families, whose pain and suffering is rarely addressed in practice. There is an urgent need to change current practice if CNMBP patients treated with LTO are to maximise their health potential and become responsible consumers of health care.",E,E

Opioids remain the mainstay of the analgesic medications for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain. Controlled release preparations of morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl and long acting opioid agents such as methadone and levorphanol have been medically and ethically accepted in managing chronic cancer pain. However, the continued use of these medications for patients with chronic noncancer pain has been fiercely debated. This article attempts to reconcile the medical and ethical dilemma of using opioid medications for chronic noncancer pain. Growing clinical experience in the field of pain medicine has helped to clarify: (1) the misunderstanding of addiction, physical dependence and analgesic tolerance, (2) the misconception that chronic opioid therapy inevitably causes personality changes, depression, and impairment of cognitive and physical function, (3) the lack of information on the correct use of opioid analgesics with regard to titration and management of related side effects. The behavioral management of pain patients undergoing chronic opioid therapy is also discussed. A protocol for optimal patient management is proposed. Particular emphasis is given to the consent form, behavioral contracting, and the consequences of noncompliance. The importance of psychologic evaluation before a long-term opioid trial, to minimize future complications, is stressed. Although most patients on the opioid regimen do well, special attention must be given to patients with current addiction, a past history of addiction, or current misuse of opioid medications. Pharmacologic and conservative interventions are often warranted in those patients with significant behavioral problems. If such strategies fail, and chronic opioid therapy is deemed necessary, some treatment guidelines are offered.",E,E

Magnesium is the physiological blocker of the NMDA-receptor-complex-associated calcium ionophore. The aim of this study was to determine if a pre-, intra- and postoperative infusion of magnesium would reduce postoperative pain.; In a prospective, randomised, double-blinded and placebo-controlled study, 24 patients undergoing elective hysterectomy in standardised general anaesthesia received a 5 h infusion of either placebo or magnesium laevulinate (initial bolus 8 mmol: then 8 mmol/h) starting with induction of anaesthesia. Postoperative analgesia was by PCA morphine for the first 48 h and patients were followed for 5 d with regular assessment of pain and side-effect scores.; Overall, pain scores were similar with magnesium and placebo infusion, although patients in the magnesium group experienced more episodes of severe or unbearable pain (placebo = 6%, magnesium = 16%, P = 0.02). Median pain scores were higher in the magnesium group only at 3 h postoperatively (P = 0.04): afterwards there were no significant differences.

There is a scarcity of data on the analgesic effects of variations of the dose of local anaesthetic drug admixed to a fixed dose of opioid.; Twenty-four patients were investigated after elective upper abdominal surgery. During closure of the abdomen, 2% mepivacaine (8 ml) with buprenorphine 0.1 mg (0.5 ml) was given extradurally. After extubation, patients were randomly allocated to receive continuous extradural infusion of a fixed dose of buprenorphine (0.017 mg/h) in combination with 2% lignocaine at either 2.1 ml/h (low rate group, n = 14) or 6.3 ml/h (high rate group, n = 10). Postoperative pain at rest was assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS) scores and pain at movement by Prince Henry Pain Scale (PHPS) scores. Venous plasma lignocaine concentrations were measured.; VAS scores at rest were similar in the two groups at 3 h postoperatively, whereas at 6-24 h postoperatively, VAS scores were higher in the low rate group than in the high rate group. PHPS scores were similar in the two groups at 3 h and at 18 h postoperatively, whereas at 6, 9, 12 and 24 h postoperatively, PHPS scores were higher in the low rate group than in the high rate group.

Patient ratings of pain and side-effects on visual analog scales were gathered daily from the start of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) therapy until the discontinuation of opioid treatment either because of resolution of oral mucositis pain, intolerable side-effects, inadequate pain control, or complications related to transplantation. Of the 119 enrolled subjects, 100 met the evaluable criteria of developing oral mucositis and remaining on the study for at least 2 days. Multivariate analysis of the outcome measures indicated that the analgesia achieved in all three opioid groups was nearly equivalent, while measures of side-effects, especially for the combination of sedation, sleep and mood disturbances, were statistically lower in the morphine group than in hydromorphone or sufentanil groups. Patients in the hydromorphone group exhibited the most variability in pain control. Event analysis also indicated significant differences in time to treatment failure between the three groups, with the morphine arm exhibiting clear superiority. The proportion of patients discontinued because of inadequate pain relief was much higher in the sufentanil group (7/36) as compared to the hydromorphone (0/34) or the morphine group (1/30). The daily opioid consumption pattern showed a continual dose escalation during the first week of therapy for all groups, coincident with worsening mucositis. Morphine consumption reached a plateau by day 5, whereas hydromorphone and sufentanil consumption continued to rise until days 7 and 9, respectively. Sufentanil dose requirement increased by approximately 10-fold compared to morphine and hydromorphone, whose requirements increased only 5-fold, suggesting the possibility of development of acute pharmacological tolerance in some patients with this phenylpiperidine opioid. This study provides support for the recommendation that morphine is the opioid of first choice when patient-controlled analgesia is employed for the treatment of severe oropharyngeal pain in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients.",E,E

Ischaemia, impaired wound healing, stump and phantom limb pain often require a complex analgesic regimen. Invasive measures such as spinal or epidural catheters can be very helpful but carry the risk of infection, as shown by this case report. A 53-year-old woman with a ten-year history of diabetes developed arterial vascular disease. Her right lower leg had been amputated two years previously. She was now admitted with necroses of the left forefoot. A bypass operation was performed under general anaesthesia. Because of intractable ischaemic pain, she was provided with an epidural catheter by the acute pain service. The bypass occluded, however, and a few days later her left lower leg also had to be amputated, this operation being performed under epidural anaesthesia with bupivacaine. The catheter was subsequently used for postoperative pain control and as a means to prevent phantom limb pain. When signs of superficial catheter infection were noticed days later, the catheter was immediately removed. Intractable pain then developed in the left leg which could not be sufficiently controlled with opioids and NSAIDs, and so a second epidural catheter was inserted one segment rostrally. Several days later the infected vascular prosthesis had to be removed followed by amputation of the thigh, this operation also being performed in epidural anaesthesia. Eleven days after insertion of the first epidural catheter, the patient complained of low back pain and headache. Examination by a neurologist revealed no signs of intraspinal infection. The second epidural catheter dislocated at this point in time and it was decided to introduce a third one, this being the only means to treat the otherwise intractable stump pain. Ten days later meningism, Kernig's sign and leucocytosis developed. NMR tomography detected intraspinal fluid in the epidural space at the dorsal border of the spinal canal. A hemilaminectomy was performed. The spinal epidural space showed signs of inflammation of the adipose tissue, but no pus. A little necrotic material and residues of an old haematoma were removed and the epidural space was lavaged. Specimens taken from the epidural material revealed colonisation with staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the broad spectrum antibiotics formerly given to the patient to treat the infection in the left stump. By the next day, all signs of epiduritis had disappeared and the patient recovered completely.",E,E

Because the thecal sac is readily available during these procedures, the addition of a single injection of morphine before wound closure can be done with technical ease. If its efficacy and safety can be verified, then it could serve as a useful adjuvant to the postoperative analgesia regimen.; Sixty-eight consecutive patients undergoing posterolateral lumbar fusion were randomly assigned to two groups. The experimental group was injected intrathecally with morphine 30 minutes before wound closure, and the control group was similarly injected with a placebo of normal saline solution. All patients were connected to an on-demand patient-controlled analgesia pump to provide any additional necessary analgesia. Their use of the patient-controlled analgesia pump was tabulated by counting the number of demands and the actual amount of morphine delivered. Additionally, a visual analog scale was used to assess pain levels at pre-established regular intervals.; The visual analog scale measurements were significantly lower for the intrathecal morphine group initially, but they surpassed those of the control group after 24 hours. Likewise, the number of patient-controlled analgesia pump demands and the amount of narcotic delivered initially were significantly lower in the experimental patients, but again reversed after the first postoperative day.

All patients received epidural lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine (1:200,000) followed by light general anaesthesia for surgical anaesthesia. They were assigned to four groups according to the combinations of each epidural opioid: 2 mg morphine alone, 2 mg morphine + 100 micrograms fentanyl, 4 mg morphine alone, and 4 mg morphine + 100 micrograms fentanyl. Morphine and fentanyl were given epidurally approximately 60 and 15 min, respectively, before the completion of surgery.; Addition of epidural fentanyl to both doses of morphine not only decreased intensity of pain associated with coughing during the early postoperative period, but also prolonged the time until the first analgesic request at each morphine dose studied. Of the combination doses, 4 mg morphine + 100 micrograms fentanyl provided the longest time to the first request for analgesic, and was associated with least amount of postoperative analgesic supplement and best patient satisfaction without increasing incidence of side effects.; The addition of 100 micrograms fentanyl to 2 mg or 4 mg epidural morphine provides clinical advantages over morphine alone for post-gastrectomy analgesia.",E,E

Nine patients had 11 tumors before 1980; 5 children had 9 tumors up to 1987. There were no new children with pheochromocytomas at our hospital from 1988 to 1995. Hypertension, sweating, headache, and visual blurring were the most common symptoms and signs (average 5 months). The most reliable biochemical investigations were the urinary catecholamines and norepinephrine. Before 1980, intravenous pyelography and angiography were most successful in localizing the tumor, but since then ultrasonography and computerized tomography have been the radiological investigations of choice. Early involvement of the anesthesiologist in the preoperative control of the hypertension is essential; blood pressure (BP) control was achieved with phenoxybenzamine. The main anesthetic drugs used were: sodium thiopental, fentanyl, methoxyflurane, isoflurane, nitrous oxide, and metocurine. Sixteen tumors were adrenal and 4 were extra-adrenal (1 intrathoracic and 1 extradural). All except 2 tumors were completely resected; they ranged in size from 1.3 to 14 cm. Ligation of the tumor's venous drainage was usually associated with a sudden, temporary fall in systemic BP. There were 2 children with malignant tumors. Four patients had five recurrences (second pheochromocytoma) within 6 years, and all were heralded by a return of their original symptoms and signs. One girl was left with no adrenal tissue. The only complication was in a boy with a large, partly-resected malignant right adrenal tumor who had a subphrenic abscess drained and was left with a temporary bile fistula, cirrhosis, and chronic pain. All children were normotensive when discharged from hospital and remain alive and well with a follow-up of 7 to 36 years. There were no deaths. Long-term follow-up is essential.

Patients received continuous morphine drips to ameliorate pain caused by a sickle cell vasoocclusive crisis (range, 10-40 micrograms/kg.h). Control subjects were randomized into those receiving acetaminophen with either 8 mg (n = 13) or 30 mg (n = 5) of codeine. All participants fasted at least 2 hours before sample collection.

The use of naloxone infusion concomitant with intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) has not been evaluated, probably because of an expected direct antagonism of the systemic opioid effect. The authors compared the incidence of morphine-related side effects and the quality of analgesia from two small doses of naloxone infusion.; Sixty patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1, 2, or 3 who were scheduled for total abdominal hysterectomies were enrolled in the study. Patients received a standardized general anesthetic. In the postanesthetic care unit, patients received morphine as a PCA. They were randomized to receive either 0.25 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) naloxone (low dose), 1 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) (high dose), or saline (placebo) as a continuous infusion. Verbal rating scores for pain, nausea, vomiting, and pruritus; sedation scores; requests for antiemetic; and morphine use were recorded for 24 h. Blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxyhemoglobin saturation were also monitored.; Sixty patients completed the study. Both naloxone doses were equally effective in reducing the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and pruritus compared with placebo (P < 0.05 by the chi-squared test). There was no difference in the verbal rating scores for pain between the groups. The cumulative morphine use was the lowest in the low-dose group (42.3 +/- 24.1 mg; means +/- SD) compared with the placebo (59.1 +/- 27.4 mg) and high-dose groups (64.7 +/- 33.0 mg) at 24 h (P < 0.05 by analysis of variance). There was no incidence of respiratory depression (<8 breaths/min) and no difference in sedation scores, antiemetic use, respiratory rate, and hemodynamic parameters among the groups.; Naloxone is effective in preventing PCA opioid-related side effects. Naloxone infusion at 0.25 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) not only attenuates these side effects but appears to reduce postoperative (beyond 4-8 h) opioid requirements. This dosing regimen can be prepared with 400 microg naloxone in 1,000 ml crystalloid given in 24 h to a patient weighing 70 kg.",E,E

Fifty-five postoperative patients, stratified into 'older' and 'younger' patients by median age, received morphine or pethidine or fentanyl patient-controlled analgesia. A strong inverse relationship was found between age and fentanyl and morphine use but not between age and pethidine use. Study II was a retrospective study of the medical records of 199 patient-controlled analgesia patients who had received morphine or pethidine patient-controlled analgesia; there were insufficient patients who had used fentanyl for a reasonable sample. There was a difference in morphine use with the younger patients using significantly more morphine than the older patients (< 60 years). Findings were less clear for patients receiving pethidine but there was an inverse correlation between age and pethidine use as well. Overall, the findings of these two studies supported the common clinical belief that older patients require less opioids than younger patients.",E,E

After litration to levels corresponding to current oral opioid use, each patient was maintained on transdermal fentanyl for one month. Oral opioid therapy was then resumed. Their experience was assessed with the a visual analogue scale for pain intensity, a numerical pain score, the Oswestry disability questionnaire, the pain disability index, and the Verran Snyder-Halpern sleep scale. Significant improvement in pain relief and disability was found with transdermal fentanyl compared with oral opioids. Mild opioid side effects were common, but easily controlled.

It is used to control moderate pain in chronic pain settings such as osteoarthritis and postoperative cases. Used in therapy as a racemic mixture, the (+)-enantiomer weakly binds to the mu-opioid receptor, and both enantiomers inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tramadol's major active metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol (ODT), shows higher affinity for the mu-opioid receptor and has twice the analgesic potency of the parent drug. The synergism of these effects contributes to tramadol's analgesic properties with the (+)-enantiomer exhibiting 10-fold higher analgesic activity than the (-)-enantiomer. Although tramadol was initially thought to exhibit low abuse potential, Ortho-McNeil, the drug's manufacturer, recently reported a large number of adverse events attributed to tramadol including abuse by opioid-dependent patients, allergic reactions, and seizures. The high number of adverse reactions has prompted the company to update the prescribing information for the drug. An analytical method using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) without derivatization for the determination of tramadol and its metabolites is reported. An n-butyl chloride extraction is followed by GC-MS analysis using a 5% phenylmethylsilicone column (30 m x 0.32-micron i.d.). Analysis of 12 blood samples from tramadol-related deaths and four nonfatal intoxications involving tramadol revealed concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 22.59 mg/L for tramadol, from 0.02 to 1.84 mg/L for ODT, and from 0.01 to 2.08 mg/L for N-desmethyltramadol.

High dose polydrug abuse for the purpose of getting high is readily recognized as a significant social problem. Inappropriate chronic benzodiazepine use is more subtle but relatively common: for anxiolytics, 36% of past-year users (3% of the adult population in the US) report using these drugs for 4 consecutive months or longer. The risks of such long-term use are much better documented than the benefits. This paper provides a current review of various problems that have been identified with the long-term use and the recreational abuse of benzodiazepines, including memory impairment, risk of accidents, falls and hip fractures in the elderly, a withdrawal syndrome, brain damage, overuse in the elderly, overuse by chronic pain patients, overuse by alcoholics and recreational abuse among alcoholics and polydrug abusers. A comprehensive review of the literature on benzodiazepine reinforcing effects in humans and laboratory animals is also provided. Drug self-administration studies in humans and laboratory animals provide models of both types of problematic benzodiazepine use. Recreational abuse of benzodiazepines has been modeled in human research with polydrug abusers and in laboratory animal studies, which show that the reinforcing effect of benzodiazepines is intermediate relative to other sedative compounds and is increased in subjects with histories of previous sedative drug self-administration. The problem of inappropriate long-term use of benzodiazepines by people without histories of drug abuse has been partially modeled in human studies showing that benzodiazepines function as reinforcers in subjects with anxiety, insomnia, and histories of moderate alcohol consumption, and in preclinical studies showing stable, low-rate benzodiazepine self-injection with concurrent physical dependence under conditions of continuous availability.

The best route of administration is by mouth, because it is simple, safe, convenient, inexpensive and effective. Non-oral modes of administration should be only considered if (a) the oral route becomes unavailable or (b) there is documentation of failure of maximal doses of oral morphine and coanalgesic drugs. Recent developments have made new routes of morphine administration fashionable--in the absence of supportive pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data--even when departure from established practice is not justified. It is important for clinicians to be familiar with the practicalities and problems that limit the utility of the non-oral routes, and the state of current understanding of these options will be reviewed.",E,E

To blind the study using available tablet strengths, the dose ratio of oxycodone to morphine was set at 2:3. A daily telephone contact was maintained between the patient and the investigator. The patients were asked to assess pain intensity four times a day and acceptability of therapy twice daily, and to record possible adverse effects. Pharmacodynamic evaluations were performed at the end of each double-blind period. The patients were allowed to use escape analgesic (respective opioid as oral solution) as needed. Twenty-seven patients were evaluable for both safety and efficacy. Pain was well-controlled during both stable phases. When the period effect was taken into account the two opioids provided comparable analgesia. If the results of the two periods were combined, the patients consumed significantly more escape doses and the mean pain intensities were significantly greater with CR oxycodone. The total opioid consumption ratio of oxycodone to morphine was 2:3 when oxycodone was administered first, and 3:4 when oxycodone was administered after morphine.

Non-noxious stimuli during these periods of hyperalgesia may expose preterm neonates to established or chronic pain. Acute physiologic changes caused by painful or stressful stimuli can be implicated as important factors in the causation or subsequent extension of early intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or the ischemic changes leading to periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). Therapeutic interventions that provide comfort/analgesia in preterm neonates were correlated with a decreased incidence of severe IVH.

They include vulvodynia, orchialgia, urethral syndrome, penile pain, prostatodynia, coccygodynia, perineal pain, proctodynia and proctalgia fugax. The etiology of these focal pain syndromes is not known. A specific secondary cause can be identified in a minority of patients, but most often the examination and work-up remain unrevealing. Although these patients are often depressed, rarely are these pain syndromes the only manifestation of a psychiatric disease. This review article presents an overview of the neuroanatomy of the pelvis, which is a prerequisite to trying to understand the chronic pain syndromes in this region. We then discuss the clinical presentation, etiology and differential diagnosis of chronic pain syndromes of the urogenital and rectal area and review treatment options. The current knowledge of the psychological aspects of these pain syndromes is reviewed. Patients presenting with these pain syndromes are best assessed and treated using a multidisciplinary approach. Currently available treatment options are empirical only. Although cures are uncommon, some pain relief can be provided to almost all patients using a multidisciplinary approach including pain medications, local treatment regimens, physical therapy and psychological support, while exercising caution toward invasive and irreversible therapeutic procedures. Better knowledge of the underlying pathophysioloigical mechanisms of the urogenital and rectal pain syndromes is needed to allow investigators to develop treatment strategies, specifically targeted against the pathophysiological mechanism.",E,E

The patients in the wound group (n = 14) received 1 ml of saline into an arm before surgery and 10 mg of morphine in 30 ml of saline into the wound at skin incision. Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with i.v. morphine was used after surgery. Repeated blood samples were obtained from the day before the surgery until 3 days later and analysed for cortisol and interleukin-6 (IL-6). There were no differences between the groups either in pain relief or in the consumption of PCA morphine. The wound group used 47 +/- 15 mg of i.v. morphine and the control group used 50 +/- 16 mg. Peak values for IL-6 and cortisol appeared at 4 h. The area under the curve (AUC) of cortisol at 0-6, 0-10 and 0-20 h was significantly lower in the control group than in the wound group (P < 0.05). High doses of i.v. morphine reduced cortisol and IL-6 levels in the early hours after surgery. The injection of morphine into the wound did not improve pain relief or reduce the consumption of i.v. morphine after surgery.

Hypnosis is also known to alleviate acute and chronic pain. We therefore compared the effectiveness of these two psychological approaches for reducing perioperative discomfort during conscious sedation for plastic surgery. Sixty patients scheduled for elective plastic surgery under local anesthesia and intravenous sedation (midazolam and alfentanil upon request) were included in the study after providing informed consent. They were randomly allocated to either stress reducing strategies (control: CONT) or hypnosis (HYP) during the entire surgical procedure. Both techniques were performed by the same anesthesiologist (MEF). Patient behavior was noted during surgery by a psychologist, the patient noted anxiety, pain, perceived control before, during and after surgery, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Patient satisfaction and surgical conditions were also recorded. Peri- and postoperative anxiety and pain were significantly lower in the HYP group. This reduction in anxiety and pain were achieved despite a significant reduction in intraoperative requirements for midazolam and alfentanil in the HYP group (alfentanil: 8.7 +/- 0.9 microg kg(-1)/h(-1) vs. 19.4 +/- 2 microg kg(-1)/h(-1), P < 0.001; midazolam: 0.04 +/- 0.003 mg kg(-1)/h(-1) vs. 0.09 +/- 0.01 mg kg(-1)/h(-1), P < 0.001). Patients in the HYP group reported an impression of more intraoperative control than those in the CONT group (P < 0.01). PONV were significantly reduced in the HYP group (6.5% vs. 30.8%, P < 0.001). Surgical conditions were better in the HYP group. Less signs of patient discomfort and pain were observed by the psychologist in the HYP group (P < 0.001). Vital signs were significantly more stable in the HYP group. Patient satisfaction score was significantly higher in the HYP group (P < 0.004). This study suggests that hypnosis provides better perioperative pain and anxiety relief, allows for significant reductions in alfentanil and midazolam requirements, and improves patient satisfaction and surgical conditions as compared with conventional stress reducing strategies support in patients receiving conscious sedation for plastic surgery.",E,E

Patients rated their mood and clinical pain on visual analog scales (VAS). Experimental pain reactions were quantified by ratings on categorical scales and evoked cerebral potentials (LEP) in response to standardized laser stimuli. A standard auditory oddball task provided reaction time (RT), errors, N1 and P2 of late auditory evoked potentials (AEP), and a P300 component. It was used to measure vigilance and cognitive performance. In parallel with clinical pain reduction, laser pain ratings and LEP amplitudes were significantly reduced. In contrast, auditory P2 and P300 amplitude were found to be even enlarged under morphine. RT and mood also failed to indicate any sedation. It is concluded that LEP indicated the analgesic morphine effects whereas late potentials and P300 from auditory stimuli reflected the perceptual-cognitive status which, instead of being deteriorated by morphine-induced sedation, improved probably due to the removal of pain as a mental stressor.",I,E

Mean pain severity was 71.6 (SD = 18.5) on the VAS scale. Forty-two percent reported poor quality of sleep. HRQL was evaluated with the Medical Outcome Study-Short Form (SF-36), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) and the Psychological General Well-Being Scale (PGWB). Compared with the normal population (NP) both SF-36 scores and PGWB scores were significantly reduced (P < 0.001) indicating that physical, psychological and social well-being were severely reduced. On the HAD scale 58% were found to have a depressive or anxiety disorder. Statistically significant but modest correlations were found between pain severity and HRQL. Psychological and social well-being was closely correlated. Sixty-three percent of the referred patients had neurogenic pain conditions. Of these, only 25% were treated with antidepressants or anticonvulsants at referral. Seventy-three percent were treated with opioids at referral. Mean opioid consumption was 64 mg of morphine per day (range 1-280 mg). Compared with the NP the chronic pain patients had used the health care system five times more often in the years prior to referral (P < 0.001).

The combination was also more effective during movement than either drug alone, but only for the first 24 h. The consumption of morphine and ketorolac was significantly lower when the two drugs were administered together. The incidence of urinary retention was highest in the group given morphine alone. The combination of half-doses of morphine and ketorolac is more effective in controlling postoperative pain than either drug alone.

Furthermore, morphine increases the secretion of CRH, ACTH and glucocorticoids, i.e. substances with inhibitory effects on the immune system. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that endogenous morphine production is increased as part of the antiinflammatory response to cardiac surgery. Sixteen patients submitted to elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery were randomized to either thoracic epidural analgesia combined with general anaesthesia (group I) or high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia (group II). Patients in group I did not receive morphine while patients in group II received systemic morphine for postoperative pain relief. From each patient 18 blood samples were taken perioperatively and tested for morphine. Furthermore, monocyte function with respect to motility and shape was determined by computer-assisted image analysis. A steep increase in plasma morphine concentrations was demonstrated on the first postoperative day in patients in group I (not given morphine). Plasma morphine levels remained significantly elevated during the following five postoperative days. Patients in group II given morphine as pain treatment showed a larger and earlier morphine peak related to the morphine administration. Computer-assisted image analysis of leukocyte behaviour revealed a biphasic increase in cell motility. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that endogenous morphine levels increase after the trauma of surgery. We surmise that morphine is part of the antiinflammatory response to cardiac surgery.",E,E

All subjects presented for emergency treatment with moderate to severe pain and had a posterior tooth with a clinical diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis. Twenty subjects randomly received either 10 micrograms fentanyl citrate or saline placebo via the periodontal ligament injection in a double-blind manner. The subjects rated their pain prior to injection and rated pain intensity and pain half gone for 59 min postinjection. Low-dose fentanyl delivered via the periodontal ligament injection in inflamed teeth provided significantly greater analgesia than the saline placebo (P < 0.05). Since the dose of fentanyl used was less than the dose required to provide analgesia by a central mechanism, the results of this study may be consistent with a peripheral opioid mechanism of action.",E,E

Many anaesthesiologists are reluctant to use thoracic epidural analgesia on general surgical wards. Therefore, we investigated in a prospective randomised study the efficacy of intercostal blocks (ICB) or interpleural analgesia (IPA) compared to PCA with systemic opioids (PCA). Following ethics committee approval and informed consent, 45 thoracotomy patients were randomised for postoperative pain management: group 1: intravenous PCA with piritramide (PCA-control), group 2: intercostal blocks of the segments concerned with 5 ml bupivacaine 0.5% at the end of surgery and 6 hours thereafter (ICB), group 3: interpleural analgesia with 20 ml bupivacaine 0.25% applied every 4 hours using a catheter placed during surgery near the apex of the pleural space (IPA). Patients in the ICB and IPA groups were able to obtain additional pain relief by PCA with piritramide. Alternative medication for all groups in case of insufficient analgesia was metamizol. Both regional analgesia groups used significantly less piritramide up to the 3rd (IPA) or 7th (ICB) postoperative day than the control group (p < 0.05). The consumption of metamizol was lower as well (n. s.). No significant differences between the study groups were observed with regard to pain scores (visual analogue scale VAS) at rest, during deep inspiration, coughing or mobilisation. Respiratory parameters as forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume (1 sec) and peak flow (FVC; FEV1; PF) were reduced significantly following thoracotomy and showed a slow restitution in all three study groups without major inter-group differences. Intercostal blocks and interpleural analgesia significantly reduce opioid demand following thoracotomy and are effective means of postoperative pain management. Nevertheless, in contrast to epidural analgesia, both methods have to be supplemented by, or combined with, systemic analgesics in most patients. On the other hand, compared to epidural analgesia, ICB and IPA are less invasive and easier to manage on general surgical wards.",E,E

We tested the hypothesis that the rapid change in blood morphine concentration associated with PCA bolus delivery contributed to PONV, and that prolonging its delivery to a brief infusion would result in decreased PONV.; Patients, who were receiving morphine for pain relief via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) after total abdominal hysterectomy, received 1 mg morphine sulphate incremental doses either over 40 s with a 5 min lockout interval or over 5 min delivery with a 1 min lockout interval. Episodes of nausea, retching and vomiting, along with the use of morphine and the pain relief obtained, were recorded.; Data from 20 patients in each group were analysed. Contrary to expectations, most patients in both groups reported nausea postoperatively. Those patients receiving morphine over 5 min experienced more episodes of emesis (36) than those receiving the dose over 40 s (17). Most patients receiving the 40 s doses vomited in the first 12 h (median time 8 h), while those receiving the 5 min doses vomited between 12 and 24 h (median time 19 h) (P = 0.01). There were no differences between groups in the visual analogue pain scores or use of morphine between groups.; Reasons for these unexpected findings remain speculative. The high incidence of PONV appears to be inherently high in gynaecological surgery patients and standard antiemetic medication regimens appear to be poorly efficacious. Reasons for the differences in the time-course of emetic episodes between the two groups may be related to differences in the time-course of central opioid receptor occupancy.",E,E

He was treated with an intravenous continuous infusion of ketorolac 120 mg in 250 mL of NaCl 0.9% infused over 24 hours. The ketorolac was given via a central line for 14 days in addition to fentanyl patient-controlled analgesia. Over this time period the patient reported his pain to be well controlled. His requests for bolus doses of fentanyl decreased dramatically and the dose of the continuous intravenous fentanyl was reduced by 22%. In addition, the total daily dose of ketorolac was reduced following a change from intermittent bolus dosing to a continuous infusion.; The management of cancer pain secondary to bone metastasis is a difficult and challenging problem frequently encountered by the healthcare team. The use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as adjuvant therapy is a common practice. However, many terminally ill patients are unable to take oral medications, thus limiting NSAID treatment options. Ketorolac tromethamine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a parenteral NSAID. As with other NSAIDs, the risk of adverse drug reactions must be considered when using this class of medication. The FDA has approved ketorolac for the short-term (< or = 5 d) management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in the postoperative setting. However, certain patients may benefit from long-term use exceeding the FDA-recommended guidelines of 5 days of maximum therapy.; A prolonged central intravenous ketorolac continuous infusion was successful in treating a cancer patient with intractable bone pain secondary to widely metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.",E,E

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent with analgesic and antipyretic activity and is an effective, primarily peripheral-acting antiinflammatory analgesic. The objective of this clinical trial was to determine the additive analgesic effect of the combination of 15 mg hydrocodone bitartrate with 400 mg ibuprofen, relative to 400 mg ibuprofen alone and placebo, in the treatment of postoperative pain. The single-dose analgesic efficacy of the combination of hydrocodone bitartrate with ibuprofen was compared with ibuprofen alone and placebo in 120 patients with moderate or severe postoperative pain after abdominal surgery. Analgesia was measured during the 6-hour period after dosing based on onset of relief, hourly and summary variables, and duration of effect. A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with the hydrocodone/ibuprofen combination reported onset of relief compared with ibuprofen or placebo; however, the distribution functions for time to onset of relief did not differ among treatments. Hydrocodone with ibuprofen and ibuprofen alone were significantly more effective than placebo for all measures of analgesia. The combination of hydrocodone with ibuprofen was significantly superior to ibuprofen for all hourly analgesic evaluations, weighted sum of pain intensity differences (SPID), total pain relief (TOTPAR), and global rating of study medication. No patients in the hydrocodone with ibuprofen group required analgesic remedication during the 6-hour study period, compared with 25% and 82% in the ibuprofen and placebo groups, respectively.

Although neuropathic pain is usually believed to be only slightly responsive to opioids, several studies show that satisfactory analgesia can be obtained if adequate doses are administered. In the present study, we tested the effectiveness of buprenorphine in 21 patients soon after thoracic surgery (nociceptive postoperative pain) and 1 month after surgery in the same 21 patients who developed postthoracotomy neuropathic pain with a burning, electrical and shooting quality. According to a double-blind randomized study, the analgesic dose (AD) of buprenorphine needed to reduce the long-term neuropathic pain by 50% (AD50) was calculated and compared to the AD50 in the immediate postoperative period. We found that long-term neuropathic pain could be adequately reduced by buprenorphine. However, the AD50 in neuropathic pain was significantly higher relative to the AD50 in the short-term postoperative pain, indicating a lower responsiveness of neuropathic pain to opioids. We also found a strict relationship between the short-term and long-term AD50, characterized by a saturating effect. In fact, if the AD50 soon after surgery was low, the AD50 increase in the long-term neuropathic pain was threefold. By contrast, if the AD50 soon after surgery was high, the AD50 in neuropathic pain was only slightly increased. This suggests that, though neuropathic pain is indeed less sensitive to opioids, in some neuropathic patients a large amount of opioid resistance is already present in other painful conditions.",E,E

Analgesic and adverse effect outcomes were summarised, and synthesised qualitatively.; In 26 trials (2225 analysed patients), 8 different NSAIDs were tested in 58 comparisons. Fifteen trials (58%) compared the same drug by different routes. Drugs were given by intravenous, intramuscular, intrawound, rectal and oral routes in postoperative pain (14 trials), renal colic (4), acute musculoskeletal pain (1), dysmenorrhoea (1), and rheumatoid arthritis (6). Five of the 15 direct comparisons were invalid because they reported no difference between routes but without evidence of internal sensitivity. In all 3 direct comparisons in renal colic, intravenous NSAID had a faster onset of action than intramuscular or rectal. In 1 direct comparison in dysmenorrhoea, oral NSAID was better than rectal. In the 5 direct comparisons in postoperative pain, results were inconsistent. In 1 direct comparison in rheumatoid arthritis, intramuscular NSAID was better than oral. Injected and rectal administration had some specific adverse effects.; In renal colic there is evidence that NSAIDs act quickest when given intravenously. This may be clinically relevant.

Information about the patient, the diagnosis, and the analgesic treatment used by the emergency teams were drawn from the patient's chart.; A total of 462 patients were included in the study. The mean pain score on arrival of the emergency team was 64 points; 36.5% of the patients were treated with analgesics. In 28.1% the emergency team tried to reduce pain through external measures (i.e., setting of fractures). In 35.3% there was no therapeutic intervention. In cases in which analgesic therapy was initiated, a definite reduction in pain was achieved during emergency care. Visual analogue scores decreased from 70 points at the beginning to 29 points at arrival to the hospital's emergency department. Analgesics were most frequently used for patients with cardiopulmonary diseases (47.2%), followed by patients with traumatic accidents (35.5%) and patients with acute abdominal pain (25.2%). Of the analgesics, opioids were given most frequently (87.0%). Nonopioid analgesic agents were used in 32.1%. The results of our investigation demonstrate that in many cases the administration of analgesics is not individualized to the patients needs.; During the prehospital period of emergency care many patients suffer from severe pain. The development of patient-oriented concepts concerning pain management could contribute to improvement of pain therapy in prehospital emergency medicine.",E,E

In a prospective, randomized study, 50 patients with clinical signs of medial meniscal injury were allocated to two groups, A and B. The patients in group A received 40 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine while the same dose of bupivacaine combined with 1 mg of morphine sulphate was administered in group B. Pain was estimated using the visual analogue scale (VAS) during surgery and at 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after the operation was completed.

Key components of the study examined the effects of long-term TENS therapy on pain-related medications and physical/occupational therapy (PT/OT) use.; From a population of 2,(X)3 chronic pain patients (CPPs) who acquired a TENS device (Epix XL, Empi, Inc., St. Paul, MN, U.S.A.) for pain management, a randomly selected sample of 376 patients who used TENS were interviewed by telephone by an independent research firm. The survey assessed a variety of outcome variables including changes in medication use, number of pain-related medications, and use of PT/OT prior to TENS and after a minimum 6 months of TENS treatment. The data were subjected to a paired t test analysis. A cost simulation model was then applied to the medication and PT/OT data.; The mean duration of pain, for which TENS was prescribed, was 40 +/- 60 months. As compared with the period prior to TENS use, this long-term TENS user group reported a statistically significant reduction in the following types of pain medications: opiate analgesics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and steroids. PT/OT use was also significantly reduced. Cost simulations of pain medications and PT/OT are presented.; Long-term use of TENS is associated with a significant reduction in the utilization of pain medication and PT/OT. In this study population, cost simulations of medication and PT/OT indicate that with long-term TENS use, costs can be reduced up to 55% for medications and up to 69% for PT/OT. The potential for TENS associated improvement, combined with reduced medication-related complications and costs, are important points that clinicians should consider when constructing a treatment plan for chronic pain patients. Finally, cost simulation techniques provide a useful tool for assessing outcomes in pain treatment and research.",E,E

Postoperative sensations of pain were realized in a visual analogous pain score, with consideration given to individual experiences of subjective pain. In addition, circulatory and hemopoiesis parameters were controlled. Results showed that the postoperative analgesic effect of Diclofenac was significantly less than that of Tramadol-retard and Naproxen. Diclofenac monotherapy after tonsillectomy was only sufficient in cases involving an individual's low pain sensation. In cases with moderate or stronger pain the tonsillectomy patient requires an effective postoperative analgesia, as achieved with combined therapy using Tramadol retard and Naproxen.

Global efficacy of treatment was rated significantly better by patients receiving the combination propacetamol + PCA morphine (87% of ""good""/""excellent"" ratings vs 65%; P = 0.01). Tolerability was comparable in the two groups. Eight patients in the propacetamol and 4 patients in the placebo group reported adverse events, of mild/moderate intensity, most commonly nausea/vomiting.

The venous retention of drug was maintained for 1 min, followed immediately by tourniquet release and propofol 100 mg i.v. injection over 20 s.; Both fentanyl and lidocaine treatments (Groups B and C) were significantly better than placebo (Group A) in reducing pain on propofol injection (p < 0.005). Lidocaine 60 mg was more effective than fentanyl 150 micrograms in reduction of pain associated with i.v. propofol (p < 0.001). Injection of fentanyl itself caused pain in 28% of patients as compared to 2% in the lidocaine group. Mild local skin erythema was noted in 14% of patients with fentanyl venous retention versus 0% of patients with lidocaine venous retention.; Intravenous retention of fentanyl 150 micrograms, although less effective than that of lidocaine (p < 0.001), showed local analgesic effect in reducing the pain on propofol injection.

Breakthrough pain is usually treated with short-acting oral opioids, most of which provide some relief after 15-20 minutes, with peak effects after 30-45 minutes. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC), a unique formulation of the opioid fentanyl, has been shown to provide meaningful pain relief within 5 minutes in patients following surgery. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of OTFC for cancer-related breakthrough pain.; Patients who were 18 years of age or older, receiving the equivalent of at least 60 mg oral morphine or at least 50 microg transdermal fentanyl per day for chronic cancer-related pain, and experiencing at least one episode of breakthrough pain per day were studied. After titration to an effective OTFC dose, subjects were given 10 randomly ordered treatment units (seven OTFC units and three placebo units) in the form of identical lozenges. If acceptable pain relief was not achieved within 30 minutes, subjects were instructed to take their previous breakthrough pain medication (i.e., rescue medication). Pain intensity, pain relief, and use of rescue medication were evaluated at 15-minute intervals over a 60-minute period.; Eighty-nine of 92 patients who received the randomized treatment were assessable (i.e., treated with at least one unit of OTFC and one unit of placebo). OTFC produced significantly larger changes in pain intensity and better pain relief than placebo at all time points (two-sided P<.0001). Episodes treated with placebo required the use of rescue medication more often than episodes treated with OTFC (34% versus 15%; relative risk = 2.27; 95% confidence interval = 1.51-3.26; two-sided P<.0001).; OTFC appears effective in the treatment of cancer-related breakthrough pain.",E,E

The transdermal therapy was performed for 158 days (range, 15-855 days). The need for increasing dosages of transdermal fentanyl was caused by the progression of the underlying cancer disease (mean initial dose, 69.5 micrograms fentanyl/hr; mean final dose, 167.7 micrograms fentanyl/hr). The transdermal system was changed every third day. Application intervals had to be shortened in 23.5% of the patients. Pain reduction was good throughout the study. Severe side effects did not occur. Constipation and the need for laxatives occurred less frequently than with previously administered oral morphine. Skin tolerance of the transdermal system was good. The treatment of cancer pain with transdermal fentanyl can be performed as a long-term therapy and result in good pain relief. Considering its specific pharmacokinetic properties, it is an alternative medication on step III of the World Health Organization's guidelines for cancer pain management.",E,E

To our knowledge, no cases of glaucoma have been reported so far. Because pain perception involves both serotonergic and noradrenergic mechanisms, venlafaxine also may be useful in neuropathic pain therapy. We report on two patients with narrow angle glaucoma affected by chronic pain. When venlafaxine treatment was begun, their ocular pressure was steadily around 17-18 mmHg. Venlafaxine was chosen (daily dose 75 mg) because this drug is claimed not to bind on muscarinic cholinergic receptors. However, 4 days later the ocular pressure of the first patient increased to 22 mmHg, which led to suspension of the drug. The ocular pressure of the second patient was 18.5 mmHg after a week, 21 mmHg after 2 weeks, and 23 mmHg after 16 days. One week after suspension, ocular pressure of the patients was 17 and 18 mmHg, respectively. Possible explanations of this ocular effect are offered: pharmacokinetic interference on the drugs used in glaucoma treatment, in vivo action on the muscarinic receptor, indirect effect via dopaminergic receptors, or direct effect on the ocular sympathetic postganglionic neurones. In any case, from a clinical viewpoint, caution should be used when giving venlafaxine to patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, and ocular pressure must be monitored.",E,E

The authors studied the change in mood during the 48-h period of epidural morphine and epidural fentanyl in 47 patients after elective hip or knee joint arthroplasty.; An epidural catheter was inserted at the L2-L3 or L3-L4 interspace. Anesthesia was induced with thiopenthal and maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide. One hour before the conclusion of the operation, patients received an epidural bolus injection of 2 mg morphine (n = 23) or 100 microg fentanyl (n = 24), followed by the same opiate (125 microg/ml morphine or 25 microg/ml fentanyl) epidurally delivered by a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump in the postoperative period for 48 h. Mood was assessed using the bipolar form of the Profile of Mood States before operation and 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after operation.; There was no significant difference in pain intensity between the groups during epidural PCA. Mood states became more positive over time in the patients who received morphine (P < 0.01 at 48 h) and negative in those who were given fentanyl (P < 0.01 at 24 and 48 h, respectively) compared with those before the operation, and they were more positive in the morphine than in the fentanyl group at 24 h, 48 h (P < 0.05), and 72 h (P < 0.01). Patients in the morphine group were more composed, agreeable, elated, confident, energetic, and clearheaded than were those in the fentanyl group (P < 0.05). There was no correlation between mood scores and pain scores in either group. There was an inverse correlation at 48 h between mood scores and plasma fentanyl concentrations (r = -0.58, P < 0.05).; Mood states are significantly more positive during epidural morphine PCA than they are during epidural fentanyl PCA.",E,E

For example, it is widely recognized, albeit with little empirical evidence, that placebo analgesia is more likely to occur after a successful analgesic therapy. On the basis of this assumption, we tested the placebo response in a population of patients who were treated with buprenorphine the day before for relieving postoperative pain. However, due to the high variability of opioid responsiveness, buprenorphine was effective in some patients and poorly effective in some others. Similarly, buprenorphine produced respiratory depression with a large variability, ranging from mild depression to no effect. We found that the placebo analgesic response depended on the buprenorphine analgesic effectiveness of the previous day. Analogously, we found that a placebo respiratory depressant response was more pronounced in those patients with a respiratory depressant response to buprenorphine on the day before, irrespective of the analgesic effectiveness. These specific effects suggest that (1) the placebo effect is experience-dependent; (2) the mechanisms underlying placebo analgesia and placebo respiratory depression are independent from each other and, by considering the role of endogenous opioids in placebo analgesia, might involve different subpopulations of opioid receptors.",E,E

Two hundred and ninety-one consecutive patients were included in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients in each group received midazolam 5 mg pre-operatively as premedication. The subjects then received either placebo (group 1), buprenorphine 0.3 mg (group 2) or the combination buprenorphine 0.3 mg plus ketoprofen 100 mg and propacetamol 2 g (group 3) intravenously (i.v.) at a constant rate.

Tramadol 3 mg kg-1 (n = 20) was administered intravenously at the beginning of wound closure, and was compared with saline (n = 20). Post-anaesthetic shivering did not occur in any patient who received tramadol, whereas it occurred in 60% of the control group (P < 0.001). There were no adverse effects on time to extubation and sedation, and discharge-ready time was shorter in the tramadol group (P < 0.05 compared with control). Pain scores in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) were statistically not different between the two groups, but significantly more supplemental medication was administered in the control group to treat shivering and/or pain.

A rare but devastating complication of this therapy is the development of spinal cord compression secondary to the formation of intrathecal granulomas.; We report three cases of intrathecal granuloma formation in the thoracic subarachnoid space, associated with intrathecal morphine pumps. These three patients were receiving high doses of morphine to control their pain (25 mg/d, 28 mg/d, and 45 mg/d, respectively) when they presented with signs and symptoms of thoracic spinal cord compression. Myelography and postmyelographic computed tomography of the spine revealed masses causing spinal cord compression.; Two patients underwent thoracic laminectomies for resection of these masses, and the other patient had the intrathecal catheter removed. A pathological examination revealed sterile granulomas in the resected masses.; Intrathecal granulomas are likely to occur with increasing frequency as the use of chronic intrathecal morphine delivery increases in patients with nonmalignant pain. The cause of intrathecal granulomas is unknown, although it is likely that morphine plays a major role in their formation.

To support these clinical data, analgesic and intestinal effects of both opioids were compared in rats. After subcutaneous injection, analgesia in the tail withdrawal reaction test was obtained at a peak effect dose of 0.032 mg/kg with fentanyl and 8.0 mg/kg with morphine. This analgesic dose exceeded the ED50 for inhibition of castor oil-induced diarrhea only slightly (1.1 x) in the case of fentanyl (0.028 mg/kg) but markedly (36 x) in the case of morphine (0.22 mg/kg). To reverse completely the antidiarrheal effect of equivalent analgesic doses of the opioids (their ED50S for analgesia lasting 2 hours), much more naloxone was required in the case of morphine (5.4 mg/kg) than in the case of fentanyl (0.19 mg/kg). After oral administration, the difference between both opioids was less pronounced. Analgesia was obtained at 0.85 mg/kg with fentanyl and 32 mg/kg with morphine. This analgesic dose only slightly (1.7 x) exceeded the antidiarrheal dose in the case of fentanyl (0.49 mg/kg) but significantly (6.2 x) in the case of morphine (5.2 mg/ kg). To reverse completely the antidiarrheal effect of equivalent analgesic oral doses of the opioids (their ED50S for analgesia lasting 2 hours), more naloxone was required in the case of morphine (11 mg/kg) than in the case of fentanyl (2.0 mg/kg). Rapid penetration of fentanyl into the brain is thought to be responsible for small dissociation between the analgesic and intestinal effect of this lipophilic opioid.

It is concluded that patients with chronic pain using narcotic analgesics are at considerable risk of developing analgesic use disorders. Assessment of the use of analgesics should be offered to pain patients taking narcotic drugs.",I,E

Twelve patients (11 females, one male) were treated according to a double-blind crossover experimental design. Each patient, after signing informed consent, was randomly allocated to either tramadol (100 mg ampul in 100 ml given intravenously in 15 min doses) or placebo for a single dose treatment. At the second visit, patients crossed over to the other drug for a further single dose treatment. There was a wash-out period of 1 week. Nine patients completed the study, while in three cases (two tramadol, one placebo) the study was discontinued due to the onset of side effects. The assessment of efficacy, carried out at the baseline and 15 min and 2 hours after administration of each dose, involved the use of a visual analog scale (VAS 100 mm) for spontaneous pain and pressure dolorimetry (kg/cm2) at 12 ""symptomatic"" tender points and nine ""control"" tender points for fibromyalgic pain. During the first treatment cycle effective control of spontaneous pain was achieved with tramadol, which determined a reduction of 20.6% while with the placebo spontaneous pain increased by 19.8%. With pressure dolorimetry there were no clinically important differences observed after either active treatment or placebo. The contrasting results found in the present study could be a stimulus for the organization of new projects, which may lead to the identification of an optimal therapeutic approach for fibromyalgic patients, also using tramadol for long periods.",E,E

The duration of paravertebral block could theoretically be prolonged by using neurolytic agents.; We retrospectively analyzed the results of neurolytic paravertebral blocks performed in 7 patients suffering from intense cancer-related thoracic pain. Thirty-seven spinal nerve roots were blocked during 20 visits. Nerve roots were identified by eliciting paresthesia radiating to the painful area. Each root was blocked separately. After test block using 0.5% bupivacaine, the paravertebral blocks were performed with 1-4 ml of 7% phenol in aqua.; No technical failures or complications were recorded in the patient files. Pain relief lasted over 2 months after 4 visits (20%), from 1 week to 1 month after 5 visits (25%), and less than 1 week after a single visit (5%). After 9 visits (45%), the results were poor with no significant pain relief.; Neurolytic paravertebral block with phenol doses used in our patients appears to have only limited use. Some patients with pain restricted to a small number of thoracic segments may benefit from its use. Because of complication risks, this technique should be limited to intractable pain in cancer patients with poor prognosis.",E,E
9606614,Optimal treatment of phantom limb pain in the elderly.,"Amputation Stumps; Animals; Humans; Pain, Postoperative; Phantom Limb","Baron, R; Wasner, G; Lindner, V","Phantom limb and stump pain is a common sequela of amputation. In geriatric patients with an amputated limb and multiple other illnesses, drug therapy may be problematic and invasive techniques may be risky. Interactions between pathophysiological mechanisms in the peripheral and central nervous systems may be responsible for the initiation and maintenance of chronic phantom limb and stump pain. These mechanisms include: (i) peripheral damage to nociceptive fibres and dorsal root ganglion cells, which acquire abnormal sensitivity to mechanical, thermal and chemical stimuli; (ii) the prolonged sensitisation of central nociceptive 'second order' neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, which become hyperexcitable and start responding to nonnoxious stimuli; and (iii) the degeneration of nociceptive neurons, which may trigger the anatomical sprouting of low threshold mechanosensitive terminals to form connections with central nociceptive neurons. This may subsequently induce functional synaptic reorganisation in the dorsal horn. The provision of a pain-free perioperative interval using regional anaesthetic techniques is likely to reduce the incidence of phantom limb pain. The therapy of manifest pain is difficult, and treatment should start as soon as possible to prevent chronic pain. In the acute state, the infusion of calcitonin and oral opioid analgesics have proven to be helpful, while established phantom limb pain may respond to antidepressants, anticonvulsants and drugs that mimic or enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid function. Pharmacological treatment should be combined with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, sympathetic blockade and psychotherapy. In addition, new therapeutic strategies are now being tested; examples include capsaicin, new anticonvulsants and N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists. Patients with severe pain should be referred to a pain specialist to ensure optimal and timely interventional pain management.",E,E

We studied 64 children, aged 6-108 months, undergoing bilateral correction of vesicoureteral reflux which was expected to last more than 90 min. Patients were allocated to one of four groups: group O received 1 ml kg-1 of a mixture of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine and 1% lidocaine in equal parts; group F received the same mixture of local anaesthetics in addition to fentanyl 1 microgram kg-1; group C received the same mixture of local anaesthetics in addition to clonidine 1.5 micrograms kg-1; and group C + F received the same mixture of local anaesthetics in addition to fentanyl 0.5 microgram kg-1 and clonidine 0.75 microgram kg-1.

Global assessment of anaesthesia, defined as the time from caudal injection to the first administration of analgesic (either during or after surgery), was significantly longer in the three groups of children who received additives compared with local anaesthetics alone (P = 0.035), but there were no differences between the three additive groups. Vomiting was observed only in children who received fentanyl. Addition of clonidine or fentanyl to local anaesthetics prolonged the duration of surgical analgesia of caudal block, allowing single shot caudal anaesthesia to be recommended for surgery lasting 90-150 minutes. Clonidine had some advantages over fentanyl as it did not produce clinically significant side effects.",E,E

The changes in physiology and homeostasis associated with multimorbidity and increasing age and the immature metabolism of neonates all increase the risk of toxicity from analgesics. Altered pharmacokinetics and metabolism influence drug pharmacodynamics and therapeutic windows. Imbalances in local homeostatic mechanisms increase local toxicity. The gastrointestinal organs and the kidney have a major role in the absorption, metabolism and excretion of analgesics and changes in their function predispose individuals to adverse effects. Knowledge of such compromise should influence the choice of analgesic, the administration regimen and the mode of application. The mainstay of chronic pain treatment are 3 classes of drugs: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids and a host of so-called adjuvant drugs, which are used to enhance the analgesic action of the classic analgesics. In each class a wide range of drugs are available, that differ in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. These differences can be exploited to either increase analgesic efficacy and reduce toxicity, or to minimise the interference of pain therapy with daily life. Clinically important differences in analgesic and toxic effects between drugs in each analgesic class will be discussed in this article from the perspective of reducing adverse effects. New knowledge concerning the mechanism of action of analgesics and their metabolites is making the specific selection of NSAIDs and opioids to reduce adverse effects in multimorbid, chronic pain patients possible.",E,E

The primary criterium of efficacy was the number of responders defined as patients with a pain reduction of at least 20 on VAS after 40 min. In case of pain, responders were allowed to continue with the double-blind drug up to six hours. The non-responders were treated with morphine as the rescue analgesic. The secondary criterium was the incidence and severity of side-effects. Six patients terminated the study prematurely. One patient was excluded because of an allergic reaction to morphine, one patient could not be treated sufficiently with morphine, four were excluded because of protocol violations. There were 8 responders in the (+)-tramadol-,6 in the (-)-tramadol- and 6 in the racemate group, 16* (P < 0.05) in the morphine group, and 5 in the placebo group. Pain intensity after 40 min was reduced by 20 (p < 0.05), 17 (p < 0.05), 17 (p < 0.05), 36 (p < 0.01 vs placebo, p < 0.05 vs (+)-,(-)-tramadol, and racemate group) and 5 mm on the VAS in the (+)-, (-)-, (+/-)-tramadol-, morphine- and placebo-group, respectively. Thirty eight adverse events like nausea, vomiting, PCO2-increase, and urinary retention occurred in 20 patients, most frequently in the (+)-tramadol- and morphine group. Sedation was significantly less profound in the (-)-tramadol group 1-4 h postoperatively. There were no side-effect in the tramadol racemate group. The enantiomers were equal to the racemate in analgesic potency, but inferior by far to morphine. They showed more adverse events and, hence, can not be preferred to the racemate in postoperative pain therapy.",E,E

Analgesic effects are principally due to the production of opioid peptides and catecholamines by chromaffin cells. Clinical trials have been reported with allografts consisting of whole-tissue fragments implanted into the subarachnoid space of the lumbar spinal cord (14,19,36). In the present study, allogeneic grafts were successfully used to control chronic pain in two patients over a period of 1 yr based on patient reported pain scores, morphine intake, and CSF levels of Met-enkephalin. Macroscopic examination at autopsy located the transplanted tissue fragments in the form of multilobulated nodules at the level of the spinal axis and cauda equina. Immunocytochemical microscopy showed neuroendocrine cells are positive for chromagranin A (CGA), and enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DbetaH). The results suggest that there is a relationship between analgesic effect, Met-enkephalin levels in CSF, and the presence of chromaffin cells surviving in spinal subarachnoid space.",E,E

We wanted to determine if colonoscopy can be successfully completed without sedation and to assess patient tolerance and acceptance. One hundred nine consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy were examined. The risks and benefits of colonoscopy with or without sedation were explained in a standard format. Patients were then given the option of having colonoscopy without premedication. After the procedure, as well as 2 to 5 days later, patients rated on an analog scale (0, no pain; 5, severe) the severity of pain and willingness to undergo colonoscopy in the future without sedation. Eighty patients underwent colonoscopy without prior sedation. Only 6% (n=5) required sedation to complete the examination. When questioned, 5% experienced no pain, 41% slight or mild pain, 34% moderate pain, and 20% severe pain. Seventy-three percent (n=58) were willing to undergo repeat colonoscopy without sedation, 10% (n=8) were undecided, and 18% (n=14) would request sedation. Pain severity was a strong predictor (p=0.001) of future sedation preference. Colonoscopy without sedation may be completed successfully in most patients and does not undermine many patients' willingness to undergo a similar procedure in the future. Sedation by choice is more cost-effective, may be safer, and should be offered as an alternative to routine intravenous sedation.",E,E

The PCA group received a continuous infusion of 1.5 mg h-1 piritramide, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, with incremental doses of 1.5 mg (lock-out interval = 15 min). The i.m. group received 0.3 mg kg-1 piritramide i.m. when requested by the patient with a minimum interval of 5 h. Pain intensity, sedation and the functional recovery of the patients were followed for 72 h post-operatively. The sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) was used as a measure of analgesic efficiency. Equipment and drug costs, and the demand on nursing time were recorded over 3 days post-operatively. The costs of PCA and i.m. therapies per patient were used to calculate the cost-benefit (cost of treatment vs. nursing time) and cost-effectiveness (cost of treatment vs. SPID) analyses. Both treatments initially provided comparable analgesia, but PCA was more efficient after 16 h and significantly reduced nursing time for pain treatment (PCA = 61 +/- 4 min, i.m. = 88 +/- 5 min; P < 0.001). Functional recovery was not different for either treatment. Cost analysis indicated a better cost-benefit ratio for the i.m. treatment (0.35 vs. 1.1 for PCA treatment), but a similar cost-effectiveness for both treatments (PCA = 1.9 Belgian Francs (BEF) unit-1 SPID; i.m. = 1.7 BEF unit-1 SPID).",E,E

A questionnaire was mailed to selected anaesthesiologists in 105 European hospitals from 17 countries. Depending on the population, between five and ten representative hospitals from each country were selected by a country coordinator. A total of 101 (96.2%) completed questionnaires were returned. A majority of respondents were dissatisfied with pain management on surgical wards. Pain management was better in post-anaesthesia care units (PACUs); however, 27% of participating hospitals did not have PACUs. There were no organized APS in 64% of hospitals, although anaesthesiologists from chronic pain centres were available for consultation. In the hospitals that had APS, the responsible person for the APS was either: (1) a junior anaesthesiologist (senior anaesthesiologist available for consultation); or (2) a specially trained nurse (supervised by consultant anaesthesiologists). Many anaesthesiologists were unable to introduce techniques such as PCA on wards because of the high equipment costs. Although 40% of hospitals used a visual analogue scale (VAS) or other methods for assessment of pain intensity, routine pain assessment and documenting on a vital sign chart was rarely practised. There was a great variation in routines for opioid prescription and documentation procedures. Nursing regulations regarding injection of drugs into epidural and intrathecal catheters also varied considerably between countries. This survey of 105 hospitals from 17 European countries showed that over 50% of anaesthesiologists were dissatisfied with post-operative pain management on surgical wards. Only 34% of hospitals had an organized APS, and very few hospitals used quality assurance measures such as frequent pain assessment and documentation. There is a need to establish organized APS in most hospitals and also a need for clearer definition of the role of anaesthesiologists in such APS.",E,E

Relative to codeine, tramadol has similar analgesic properties but may have fewer constipating, euphoric, and respiratory depressant effects. A two-center randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial was performed to assess the analgesic efficacy and reported side effects of tramadol 100 mg, tramadol 50 mg, codeine 60 mg, aspirin (ASA) 650 mg with codeine 60 mg, and placebo. Using a third molar extraction pain model, 200 healthy subjects were enrolled in a 6-hour evaluation after a single dose of drug.

Using standard measures of analgesia, including total pain relief score (TOTPAR), maximum pain relief score (MaxPAR), sum of pain intensity difference scores (SPID), peak pain intensity difference (Peak PID), remedication, and global evaluations, all active treatments were found to be numerically superior to placebo. ASA/codeine was found to be statistically superior to placebo for all measures of efficacy. Tramadol 100 mg was statistically superior to placebo for TOTPAR, SPID, and time of remedication, whereas tramadol 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo onlyfor remedication time. Codeine was not found to be statistically superior to placebo for any efficacy measure.

One hospital from each of the former health regions of England and Wales was selected for inclusion in the project. Hospitals included representatives of different size units (university, large and small district general hospitals). As a result of the study, there was an overall reduction in the percentage of patients who experienced moderate to severe pain at rest from 32% to 12%. The incidence of severe pain on movement decreased from 37% to 13% and moderate to severe pain on deep inspiration from 41% to 22%. Similar decreases were seen in the incidence of nausea and vomiting. There was also a slight reduction in the incidence of postoperative complications. This study shows that simple techniques for the management of postoperative pain are effective in reducing the incidence of pain both at rest and during movement and should form part of any acute pain management strategy.",E,E

The importance of the dihydromorphine metabolites for analgesia in poor metabolizers is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the importance of the dihydromorphine metabolites of dihydrocodeine in analgesia by investigating the effects of dihydrocodeine on somatic and visceral pain thresholds in extensive and quinidine-induced poor metabolizers.; Eleven healthy subjects participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, four-way cross-over study comparing the effects of single doses of placebo and slow-release dihydrocodeine 60 mg with and without premedication with quinidine sulphate 50 mg on electrical, heat and rectal distension pain tolerance thresholds. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of dihydrocodeine and dihydromorphine were measured.; In quinidine-induced poor metabolizers the plasma concentrations of dihydromorphine were reduced between 3 and 4 fold from 1.5 h to 13.5 h after dosing (P < 0.005) and urinary excretion of dihydromorphine in the first 12 h was decreased from 0.91% to 0.28% of the dihydrocodeine dose (P < 0.001). Dihydrocodeine significantly raised the heat pain tolerance thresholds (at 3.3 h and 5 h postdosing, P < 0.05) and the rectal distension defaecatory urge (at 3.3 h and 10 h postdosing, P < 0.02) and pain tolerance thresholds (at 3.3 h and 5 h postdosing, P < 0.05) compared with placebo. Premedication with quinidine did not change the effects of dihydrocodeine on pain thresholds, but decreased the effect of dihydrocodeine on defaecatory urge thresholds (at 1.5 h, 3.3 h and 10 h postdosing, P < 0.05).; In quinidine-induced poor metabolizers significant reduction in dihydromorphine metabolite production did not result in diminished analgesic effects of a single dose of dihydrocodeine. The metabolism of dihydrocodeine to dihydromorphine may therefore not be of clinical importance for analgesia.

Blood pressure, heart rate, oxyhemoglobin saturation, and temperatures from the body core and skin of the calf and ipsilateral great toe were recorded. Cold and pin prick sensation, motor block, and visual analogue scores for sedation, pruritus, and nausea also were assessed. Current perception thresholds using the Neurometer current perception threshold instrument (Neurotron, Inc., Baltimore, MD) were determined for three frequencies (2,000, 250, and 5 Hz, corresponding to stimulation of Abeta, Adelta, and C fibers, respectively) on the upper and lower extremities.; Pruritus and sensory changes to pin prick and cold occurred in the sufentanil group but not the saline group. Neither group had a significant change in blood pressure, heart rate, oxyhemoglobin saturation, sedation, or core temperature. There was a clinically insignificant difference in the calf minus toe temperature index between the saline and sufentanil groups. There was a small increase in the current perception thresholds at 250 Hz in the sufentanil group.; Intrathecally administered sufentanil did not affect blood pressure in male volunteers. The other effects of sufentanil, however, were similar to those observed in women undergoing labor. This suggests that the hypotension occurring in these women after intrathecally administered sufentanil is secondary to relief of pain, rather than to a sympathectomy.",E,E

It is tempting to speculate that these characteristics will make remifentanil an easy drug to titrate, and that clinicians will not need to consider patient covariates such as advanced age when choosing a dosing regimen. However, the rapid onset of drug effect may be accompanied by rapid onset of adverse events such as apnea and muscle rigidity. The rapid offset of drug effect can result in patients who are in severe pain at a time when the anesthesiologist is ill equipped to deal the problem, for example when the patient is in transit to the recovery room. It is thus important that when treating elderly patients anesthesiologists understand the proper dose adjustment required for the elderly. By adjusting the bolus and infusion doses, the anesthesiologist can hope to avoid the peaks and valleys that might expose these patients to risk. When the proper adjustment is made, the variability in remifentanil pharmacokinetics is considerably less than for any other intravenous opioid. This makes remifentanil the most predictable opioid for treatment of the elderly.",E,E

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether such an abnormal response to morphine challenge is entirely dependent on opioid receptor activation. A role for excitatory amino acids and gamma-aminobutyric acid has been proposed on the basis of the effect of diazepam. As opposed to naloxone, this gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist was found to inhibit the adverse effects of low doses of morphine in migraine sufferers, while at the same time being able to almost abolish morphine-induced miosis in subjects who underwent a short-lasting chronic pretreatment. The capacity of diazepam either to control the adverse effects of morphine or to induce well-being in subjects known to suffer from a central neurogenic pain such as migraine, is noteworthy even regarding the clinical treatment of other painful conditions, such as deafferentation pain, which is known to be not satisfactorily treated by using morphine.",E,E

A total of 50 adults were admitted (31 males, 19 females, mean age 48 years) to undergo hemorrhoidectomy or traumatological or abdominal surgery. Following a randomization list, each patient was given one ampul of tramadol (100 mg/2 mL) or pentazocine (30 mg/mL) by intramuscular injection at 8-h intervals for 3 days. Efficacy was assessed on both the basis of severity of pain (rated using a visual analog scale in the 6th h after the first injection and during the 3 days of treatment), and quality of sleep (rated using a five-point scale). Local reactions at the injection site (pain, skin reactions) were also assessed, as were systemic reactions (vital parameters, blood and biochemistry tests), and any untoward events were reported. Both drugs had good antalgic activity, significantly relieving pain in the 3 days of treatment (p < 0.01 from baseline). The first dose of tramadol was significantly more effective than pentazocine after the 1st h and throughout the subsequent 5 h. Final judgments on efficacy and acceptability were in favor of tramadol (p < 0.01 from pentazocine). Local and systemic safety were good, with no reactions at the injection site and no changes in vital parameters or laboratory findings. No patient reported any adverse reactions.",E,E

In a 24 h open label phase, patients took 100 mg of tramadol followed by 50 mg every 6 h (total 250 mg) in addition to their daily NSAID regimen. Supplemental analgesics were prohibited. Patients who met entry criteria and were willing to continue therapy were randomized to a 13 day double blind phase of adjunctive therapy with tramadol (50-100 mg every 4-6 h as needed for pain) or placebo; NSAID therapy was continued. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to exit from the study because of therapeutic failure (i.e., insufficient pain relief or an inability to perform activities of daily living).; The time to exit from the study because of insufficient pain relief tended to be longer in the tramadol group (250 mg/day) compared with the placebo group (p = 0.066). At the end of the double blind phase, pain at rest was significantly less severe in tramadol treated patients (p = 0.046).

Recent evidence has show that surgical trauma induces processes of nervous system sensitisation that contributes to and enhances postoperative pain and leads to chronic pain. This knowledge provides a rational basis for pro-active, pre-operative and post-operative analgesic strategies which can reduce the neuronal barrage associated with tissue damage. As well as a reduction or elimination of post-operative pain, an improvement in physiological variables, such as neuroendocrine stress responses and post-operative pulmonary function can be expected. Complete pain control cannot be achieved with a single agent or technique without significant serious adverse effects, a problem which is compounded in the elderly patient due to a combination of slower drug metabolism, decreased organ function and physiological changes in cardiovascular and respiratory reserves. A balanced analgesic regimen that includes an effective afferent block (regional analgesia) is more appropriate.

We prospectively compared the effects, on postoperative pain and narcotic use, of intraarticular preoperative injections of 1) placebo with epinephrine, 2) bupivacaine with epinephrine, and 3) bupivacaine and morphine with epinephrine. Thirty patients (10 in each group) underwent arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft under general anesthesia. Pain was assessed with a 10-point visual analog scale pre- and postoperatively, and postoperative narcotic pain medication use was recorded. Postoperative pain was significantly greater in group 1 (placebo) than in the preemptive-treatment groups (groups 2 and 3), and in group 2 than in group 3. The differences became less apparent with time, and after 1 hour, no significant differences in pain scores existed between the groups. However, intravenous narcotic pain medication was administered in the recovery room to patients with pain scores greater than 5, equalizing pain scores. Group 3 used significantly less postoperative narcotic medication than group 1.

In order to assess optimum anesthesia for each patient undergoing a standardized ESWL protocol, pain measurement and scoring were carried out. We attempted to determine the individual type and amount of analgesia prior to treatment.; Patients (n = 95) with urolithiasis underwent pain measurement and scoring prior to ESWL. 'Threshold of pain' (TP) and 'maximal tolerable pain (MTP) were assessed by inducing ischemia pain with the submaximum effort tourniquet technique. Pain intensity was assessed by a verbal rating scale (VRS). The results of pain measurement and amount of analgosedation were correlated in two phases. Patients were administered an oral premedication of 0.1 mg/kg midazolam. Phase 1: 60 patients were randomized into three groups: (1) piritramide (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) and midazolam (1-3 mg) i.v. (2) Lidocaine/prilocaine cream topically (30 g) to skin and diclofenac supp. 100 mg. (3) No analgesia. Phase 2: Based on the data of phase 1, cut-off points for TP and MTP were set for female and male patients. In accordance with these results, 35 patients comprised group 1 for anesthesia with piritramide/midazolam, group 2 with lidocaine/prilocaine cream and diclofenac supp. and group 3 for no analgesia at all. The electromagnetic shockwave sources Modulith SLX and Lithostar Plus were utilized.; Phase 1: All patients randomized for group 1 (intravenous analgosedation) were treated in accordance with the protocol. 65% of group 2 (cream/suppository) tolerated treatment as planned. 35% of patients selected for ESWL without analgesia (group 3) remained within this group. Patients requiring additional analgosedation displayed lower TP and MTP. The cut-off points for females and males were TP >/=25/35 s and MTP >/=45/60 s, respectively.

The determined parameters are suitable for patient preselection and individual assessment of anesthesia prior to ESWL. It may be assumed that 50% of patients administered intravenous opioids are overtreated. Routine pain measurement for patient depends on the individual pain tolerance level.

Effective management of acute pain enhances early rehabilitation and recovery. Given the importance of inflammatory mediators in pain generation and the adverse effects associated with opioids, it is logical to expect that a non-opioid agent with antiinflammatory and analgesic properties would provide excellent analgesia with fewer adverse effects. This double-blind, randomized, multicenter clinical trial, performed in six university and community hospital EDs, compares the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of ketorolac to those of acetaminophen-codeine in ED patients with acute musculoskeletal low back pain. Our hypothesis was that ketorolac would provide superior analgesia with fewer adverse effects. One hundred twenty-three patients with acute low back pain were randomized to receive ketorolac (KET, N = 63) or acetaminophen-codeine (ACOD, N = 60). Most (79%) were males, and the mean age was 34.5 years. After baseline clinical assessment, patients were treated with ketorolac (10 mg every 4 to 6 h as needed, up to four daily doses) or acetaminophen-codeine (600 mg-60 mg, respectively, every 4 to 6 h as needed, up to six daily doses) and followed for one week. Pain intensity was assessed on visual analogue and categorical scales. Functional capacity, overall pain relief, and overall medication rating were assessed on categorical scales. Adverse events were documented. Primary outcomes included: 1) Pain intensity differences, based on visual analogue scores, for the 0 to 6 h treatment phase. 2) Incidence of adverse events. Secondary outcomes included analgesic efficacy, functional capacity, and overall subjective drug evaluation at one week. Both drugs provided substantial pain relief, with maximal effect 2.2 h after oral dosing. There were no significant differences in analgesic efficacy, functional capacity, or overall pain relief between the two groups. Sixteen patients (10 KET vs. 6 ACOD, NS) withdrew prematurely because of drug inefficacy. Patients in the ACOD group reported significantly more adverse drug events and serious adverse drug events. Seven patients--all in the ACOD group--withdrew from the study because of adverse drug events. Based on comparable efficacy and a superior adverse event profile, ketorolac was preferable to acetaminophen with codeine for the treatment of acute low back pain in the ED.",E,E

We selected patients that required at least two successive increments of morphine to maintain pain relief. A possible pharmacokinetic interaction between nimodipine and morphine was also studied in 14 patients by assaying steady-state serum levels of morphine and its 3- and 6-glucuronides. A total of 30 patients completed the study, 14 and 16 in the nimodipine and placebo groups, respectively. Nimodipine controlled the escalation of the morphine dose in 9 patients (65%), and placebo in 4 (28%), the difference being statistically significant (P=0.03). The dose of morphine was reduced from 313+/-52 to 174+/-33 mg/day (P < 0.001) in the nimodipine group, and from 254+/-26 to 218+/-19 mg/day (not significant) in the placebo group. The percentages of reduction in the daily dose of morphine also showed significant differences between both groups (P=0.02). One week after introducing nimodipine or placebo, while the dose of morphine remained similar to that of the pre-test week, the serum levels of morphine and its glucuronides were not modified significantly. We conclude that the introduction of nimodipine in patients chronically treated with morphine may be a safe alternative to reduce the daily requirements of the opioid. It is suggested that interference with Ca2+-related events may attenuate the development and/or expression of tolerance to morphine in a clinically relevant way.",E,E

The cytochrome P-450 enzyme CYP2D6 catalysing the formation of morphine exhibits a genetic polymorphism. Two distinct phenotypes, the extensive (EMs) and poor metabolisers (PMs), are present in the population. The prevalence of PMs in the Caucasian population is 7% to 10%. Since PMs do not express functional CYP2D6, they have a severely impaired capacity to metabolise drugs which are substrates of this enzyme. Provided the analgesic effect and the adverse events of codeine are mediated by its metabolite morphine, large phenotype-related differences are to be expected and PMs, as they form only trace amounts of morphine, can serve as a model to test the hypothesis whether the analgesia and adverse events of codeine are mediated by the parent drug or its metabolite morphine. Therefore we have studied in a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind trial the analgesic effect of 170 mg codeine (p.o.) compared to 20 mg morphine (p.o.) and placebo in 9 EMs and 9 PMs using the cold pressor test. The duration and intensity of the side effects were assessed using visual analogue scales (VAS). Codeine and morphine concentrations were measured in serum and urine. Compared to placebo, 20 mg morphine caused a significant increase in pain tolerance in both phenotypes, EMs and PMs (16.2+/-27.4 vs. -0.66+/-27.4 s x h, n=18). However, following administration of codeine, analgesia was only observed in EMs but not in PMs (EMs: 54.9+/-42.2 vs. 1.7+/-4.2 s x h, P < 0.01; PMs: 9.6+/-10.9 vs. 3.3+/-23.7 s x h, not significant). Adverse events were significantly more pronounced after morphine and codeine compared to placebo in both EMs and PMs. In contrast to the phenotype-related differences in the analgesic effect of codeine, however, no difference in adverse events between the phenotypes could be observed. In the pharmacokinetic studies, significant differences between the two phenotypes in the formation of morphine after codeine administration could be observed. Whereas morphine plasma concentrations were similar in PMs (Cmax: 44+/-13 nmol/l: AUC: 199+/-45 nmol x h/l) and EMs (Cmax: 48+/-17 nmol/l); AUC: 210+/-65 nmol x h/l) after morphine administration, following 170 mg codeine, morphine plasma concentrations comparable to those after morphine application were only observed in EMs (Cmax: 38+/-16 nmol/l; AUC: 173+/-90 nmol x h/l). In PMs only traces of morphine could be detected in plasma (Cmax: 2+/-1 nmol/l; AUC: 10+/-7 nmol x h/l). The percentage of the codeine dose converted to morphine and its metabolites was 3.9% in EMs and 0.17% in PMs. The interindividual variability in analgesia of codeine which is related to genetically determined differences in the formation of morphine clearly indicate that this metabolite is responsible for the analgesic effect of codeine. In contrast to the analgesic effect, frequency and intensity of the adverse events did not present significant differences between the two phenotypes. These findings have implications for the clinical use of codeine. Since side effects occurred in both EM and PM subjects, the use of codeine as an analgesic will expose 7% to 10% of patients who are PMs to the side effects of the drug without providing any beneficial analgesic effects.",E,E

These effects are most prominent under localized inflammatory conditions. The clinical use of such peripheral analgesic effects of opioids was soon investigated in numerous controlled clinical trials. The majority of these have tested the local, intraarticular administration of morphine in knee surgery and have demonstrated potent and long-lasting postoperative analgesia. As the direct application of morphine into the pain-generating site of injury and inflammation appears most promising, we examined direct morphine infiltration of the surgical site in a unique clinical model of inflammatory tooth pain. Forty-four patients undergoing dental surgery entered into this prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Before surgery they received, together with a standard local anesthetic solution (articaine plus epinephrine) a submucous injection of either 1 mg of morphine (group A) or saline (group B). Postoperative pain intensity was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) and numeric rating scale (NRS) at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h after surgery. In addition, patients recorded the occurrence of side effects and the supplemental consumption of diclofenac tablets. Results of 27 patients were analyzed (group A: n=14, group B: n=13). Pain scores which were moderate to severe preoperatively were reduced to a similar extent in both groups up to 8 h postoperatively. Thereafter, pain scores in group A were significantly lower than those in group B for up to 24 h, demonstrating the analgesic efficacy of additional morphine. The time to first analgesic intake and the total amount of supplemental diclofenac were less in group A than in group B. No serious side effects were reported. Our results show that 1 mg of morphine added to a local anesthetic for dental surgery results in significant improvement of postoperative analgesia. Since the majority of dental surgeries is accompanied with an inflammatory reaction, supplemental morphine may be of benefit for the relief of postoperative dental pain.",E,E

Chronic ischemic pain due to lower extremity arteriosclerosis obliterans often responds poorly to analgesics, and the pain-generating mechanisms are not well understood.; Eight patients with rest pain in the lower extremity due to arteriosclerosis obliterans were given sub-dissociative doses of 0.15, 0.30, or 0.45 mg/kg racemic ketamine and morphine 10 mg as a 5-min infusion on four separate days in a cross-over, double-blind, randomised protocol. Plasma levels of (S)- and (R)-ketamine and their nor-metabolites were analysed with an enantioselective high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Pain levels were evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS).; Individual pain levels were highly variable during and after all the infusions but the pooled pain levels showed a dose-dependent analgesic effect of ketamine with a transient but complete pain relief in all the patients at the highest dose (0.45 mg/kg). Side-effects, mainly disturbed cognition and perception, were pronounced and dose-dependent. Morphine 10 mg had an analgesic peak at 20 min and 5/8 patients had complete pain relief. These 3 patients also had high baseline pain scores, indicating a higher analgesic potency for the 0.30 and 0.45 mg/kg ketamine doses than for morphine 10 mg.; We have demonstrated a potent dose-dependent analgesic effect of racemic ketamine in clinical ischemic pain. Due to a narrow therapeutic window, this analgesic effect is probably best utilised in combination with other analgesics.",E,E

A 27-g Quinke needle was used for SA and a 18-g Tuohy needle for EA. Patients, operating team and postoperative ward personnel were all blinded to the anaesthetic given and so was an independent observer responsible for follow-up after 5-7 days. The occurrence of headache, backache and other complaints was recorded. Headache was classified as PPDPH or non-PPDPH, and duration and intensity of the headache was registered. The quality of anaesthesia was directly evaluated by the surgeon using a VAS scale from 1 (excellent) to 10 (very poor) and indirectly by the supplemental use of opioid analgesia and general anaesthesia in the two groups.; 212 patients, 103 SA and 109 EA, with a mean age of 36.7 years, could be fully evaluated. The groups were comparable with regards to age, sex and surgical procedure performed. Headache occurred in 44 patients postoperatively. PPDPH was diagnosed in 16 patients (15.5%) in the SA group and 2 (1.8%) in the EA group (P = 0.0014). Non-PPDPH occurred in 13 patients in each group. PPDPH had significantly greater mean intensity and duration than non-PPHPH. More patients in the EA group had postoperative backache (31.2%) than in the SA group (22.3%), but this difference was not statistically significant. More patients in the EA received general anaesthesia and opioid analgesia than in the SA group, and the surgeon's rating was on average 1.3 in the SA group compared to 2.5 in the EA group (P = 0.0003).; SA gave more headache but superior quality of surgical anaesthesia compared with EA.

Therefore, the need for sufficient pain management and symptomcontrol is obvious. Throughout the last decades new drugs and techniques for the management of cancer-pain have been developed. Most cancer-patients should experience sufficient pain-management if existing recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of cancer-pain (e.g. WHO-guidelines) are followed consequently.

To treat cancer pain patients appropriately, an interdisciplinary setting is essential. In the eyes of experienced pain specialists as well as physicians in palliative medicine invasive procedures are only of minor importance. Their use has been steadily decreasing while neuromodulatory (e.g. intraspinal opioids) or stimulatory (e.g. TENS, DBS, SCS) methods gained wider acceptance. The only neurolytic procedure which still has some importance is the neurolysis of the celiac ganglion for alleviation of pain in the upper abdomen mostly due to pancreatic cancer. This approach seems to be highly effective and tends to be afflicted with only minor complications. Other neurolytic blocks have shown solely local and temporal efficacy. In their majority they are unprecise and often accompanied by severe complications. Therefore these procedures should be scheduled only after carefully weighing risk versus benefit. Where suitable, the use of neurolytics is replaced by radiofrequency thermocoagulation, to a lesser degree by cryoanalgesia. Both procedures normally do not yield better analgesia but do result in fewer complications. Physicians tend to treat pain as a completely somatic disorder, but chronic pain states are always bio-psycho-social in nature. In order to achieve an effective pain treatment all influencing variables have to be taken into account. Anesthesiological and neurosurgical procedures are only a part of the possible and necessary treatment options. Especially before using one of the invasive methods described here, it seems imperative to involve the patient in the process of decision making more closely than currently practiced.",E,E

Thus, binding experiments were performed on spinal cord membranes from rats, guinea pigs, monkeys and humans. We found that kappa2 receptors were approximately ten times more abundant than kappa1 receptors in all species tested.

In autologous BMT patients (n = 87) glutamine was associated with significantly less mouth pain by self report and by opiate use (5.0+/-6.2 days of morphine for glutamine vs 10.3+/-9.8 days for placebo; P= 0.005). Matched sibling BMT patients had no effect by self report and an increased duration of opiate use (23.2+/-5.7 days for glutamine vs 16.3+/-8.3 days for placebo) (P = 0.002). However, day 28 survival of allogeneic patients was improved by glutamine. No significant differences in TPN use, rate of relapse or progression of malignancy, parenteral antibiotic use, acute or chronic GVHD, or days of hospitalization were observed in either autologous or allogeneic recipients. No toxicity of glutamine was observed. We conclude that oral glutamine can decrease the severity and duration of oropharyngeal mucositis in autologous BMT patients but not in allogeneic BMT patients, possibly due to interaction with methotrexate.",E,E

However, PCA-controlled patients required significantly less diamorphine than CI controlled patients (mean, 131 +/- 23 mg for PCA vs 296 +/- 40 mg for CI; P = 0.001), and PCA required fewer days of diamorphine than CI (mean, 7.17 +/- 0.66 days for PCA, 9.00 +/- 0.65 days for CI; P = 0.03). Side-effects were minimal and equivalent in the two arms. The findings suggest that PCA and CI offer equivalent control of the pain of BMT-associated mucositis, but PCA requires less total consumption and duration of diamorphine therapy.",E,E

The mainstay of analgesic intervention for cancer and AIDS pain of moderate to severe intensity continues to be the appropriate use of opioid analgesics. There is, however, a growing appreciation for the role of adjuvant analgesics, such as antidepressants and other psychotropic medications, at each step of the WHO Analgesic Ladder, particularly in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Knowledge of the indications and usefulness of psychotropic analgesic drugs in cancer and AIDS pain populations will be most important to clinicians practicing in psycho-oncology/AIDS settings, particularly since these drugs are useful not only in the treatment of psychiatric complications of cancer and AIDS, but also as adjuvant analgesic agents in the management of pain. This paper reviews the literature on the use of antidepressants, psychostimulants, neuroleptics, anticonvulsants and other psychotropic analgesics in the management of cancer and AIDS pain. Mechanisms of analgesia, drug selection, and recommendations for clinical usage are discussed. The appropriate and timely use of psychotropic adjuvant analgesic drugs represents an opportunity for active psychiatric contribution to the multidisciplinary management of cancer and AIDS pain.",E,E

It should prompt efforts to identify and treat the causative disease. A minority of patients experience persistent pain not related to neoplasm. This pain may last for years, but is usually not severe. A small subset of these patients experience persistent severe pain, which may be debilitating. The pain may be owing to various causes. Diagnosis and treatment should be individualized and directed toward the causes believed to be present. First-line pharmacologic therapies include NSAIDs, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics, and low-dose opioids. Some patients require more sophisticated treatment from multidisciplinary pain-management clinics. This treatment may include nerve blocks, physical therapy, sympathectomy, cryoneurolysis, or long-term neuromodulation with epidural analgesia or spinal cord stimulation. Because of the severe pain these patients may experience and the difficulty and expense associated with treatment, prevention may be the best strategy for dealing with this problem. Recent laboratory and clinical studies indicate that minimizing perioperative pain can suppress certain alterations in the nervous system that may prevent the genesis and maintenance of chronically painful conditions. This suggests that strategies for avoiding PTPS may begin with aggressive perioperative anesthetic and analgesic techniques. More effective application of knowledge already available from laboratory studies awaits further clinical trials. New drugs such as NMDA inhibitors hold promise for more effective treatment in the future.",E,E

Parturients at 2- to 5-cm cervical dilation received either 5 microg sufentanil plus 30 microg clonidine or 5 microg sufentanil intrathecally, followed by 5 mg bupivacaine epidurally. The primary outcome was time until first request for additional analgesia. Visual analog pain scores, sensory changes, blood pressure, heart rate, ephedrine requirements, motor blockade, sedation, pruritus, and nausea were also recorded.; All parturients but one had effective analgesia in both groups, with similar sensory levels never exceeding T2. The duration (mean +/- SD) of analgesia was longer in the sufentanil-clonidine group: 125+/-46 versus 97+/-30 min (P = 0.007). The incidence of hypotension and the ephedrine requirements (median with range) were higher in the sufentanil-clonidine group: 63% versus 12% (P < 0.001) and 7.5 mg [range, 0-25.5 mg] versus 0 mg [range, 0-6 mg] (P < 0.0001). The incidence of fetal heart rate abnormalities during the first 30 min after intrathecal injection was similar in both groups (17% vs. 19%). No parturient had motor blockade.; The addition of 30 microg clonidine to 5 microg intrathecal sufentanil extended the duration of labor analgesia without producing motor blockade. However, as previously reported with 100-200 microg clonidine, the incidence of hypotension and the ephedrine requirements were also increased, even when 30 microg clonidine only was added.",E,E

9750799,[Prevention of postoperative pain].,"Analgesia; Analgesics; Anesthetics, Local; Humans; Pain, Postoperative","Fletcher, D","The pre-emptive analgesia concept suggests that pre-administration of analgesics may enhance the efficacy of these drugs. This review has selected the data from the literature according to two types of methodological criteria: Sackett's criteria, and those specific of pre-emptive analgesia studies. Infiltration, spinal and peripheral nerve blocks using local anaesthetic drugs do not seem to produce pre-emptive analgesia. The few positive results have limited clinical significance. The results concerning opioids are contradictory and the clinical significance is limited. Preoperative oral administration of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) offers no benefit. Intravenous pre-administration has a limited advantage, but enhances perioperative bleeding. Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, may have some pre-emptive analgesic properties according to the few studies available. In conclusion, pre-administration of analgesic drugs represents the usual strategy for the anaesthesiologist (spinal or peripheral block, infiltration, opioids). In other cases (NSAIDs, ketamine), pre-administration represents a change in usual practice. This is not justified for NSAIDs; NMDA receptor antagonists may offer an interesting research area. Data concerning pre-emptive analgesia for chronic pain syndrome such as phantom limb pain are quite limited.",E,E

The great majority of patients can be helped by simple treatments. The prescription of morphine (M) must be preceded by some explanations. In order to verify the reality of these explanations, a study was done in a 230 comprehensive beds Cancer Centre, with 129 patients, randomized between all the patients hospitalized. In an open questionnaire, different aspects were studied. One hundred answers were studied: 63 patients did not have M at any time: group M-; 37 patients had M (19) or have had M (18): group M+; 97% of the patients in group M+ thought that M decreased pain, for 85% patients in group M-. Morphine treatment was effective in 92% of patients M+, and not very effective in 5%; 67% of patients M- thought that M is efficient but 17% did not know; 76% of patients M+ did not worry about M; 13% worried et 11% did not know. For patients M- only 48% did not worry; 41% worried and 11% did not know. The side effect known by the patients, and spontaneously quoted were constipation (12 patients in M+ group). For 14 patients there was no problem and 2 did not know. In M- group 49 patients did not know. Only 8% of M+ group were afraid by addiction, but 44% in group M-; 97% patients M+ said that they could stop without problem against only 38% of the patients in M- group. For 16% of M+ group, the use of M had a bad signification about their disease, but 52% of M- group thought that if morphine was used in their cases, the meaning would be very bad. The differences between the two groups allow to think that the prescription of M in this study is explained, and that the patients receiving M are rather well informed. Patients with cancer but without M do not have good information and their knowledge is similar than general population. The use of recommended therapy and explanations allowed patients with M therapy to be comfortable with this prescription.",E,E

Epidural catheters were inserted by a team that supervised catheter care and infusion rates in the postoperative period. The nonepidural group received intramuscular injections on a regular basis. Patients filled out visual analog scales to measure levels of pain ( 1 = minimal, 10 = maximal) every eight hours. Patient activity, bowel, and urinary function were recorded by the nursing staff. Control of pain (as measured by the daily average visual analog score) was more effective in Group 1 (P < .001) on postoperative days 1-3 (1.3 vs 3.6 on day 1, 0.7 vs 2.6 on day 2, 0.9 vs 3 on day 3).

Measures of efficacy were observational distress scores and self- and parental-report. Measures of safety were frequency of abnormalities in and need for support of cardiopulmonary function and other adverse effects.; During FR, K/M subjects (n = 130) had lower distress scores and parental ratings of pain and anxiety than did F/M subjects (n = 130). Although both regimens equally facilitated reductions, deep sedation, and procedural amnesia, orthopedists favored K/M. Recovery was 14 minutes longer for K/M.

In epidemiological studies, sex differences are also noted in the prevalence of a number of pain syndromes, with females reporting more severe pain, more frequent pain, and pain of longer duration. Complicating the interpretation of pain differences between men and women in clinical samples are reports of sex differences in response to pain-reducing medications. Studies in human subjects suggest that women respond better to certain opioid analgesics than men following third molar extraction, but few studies have assessed sex effects in effectiveness of topical anesthetics. The purpose of this study was to test for sex differences in response to a topical anesthetic, Lidocaine, using double blind, placebo controlled experimental methodology, in combination with a magnitude matching psychophysical protocol using a pressure algometer. The subjects were 21 female and 23 male adult volunteers. Twenty-four subjects (12 males and 12 females) were randomly assigned to the Lidocaine condition and 20 subjects were randomly assigned to the placebo control condition (9 males and 11 females). The effect size across sex for subjects in the Lidocaine treatment condition on the response bias variable was large indicating the males rated the stimuli as less painful than the females. Sex differences were not observed for discriminability in the Lidocaine treatment condition. This study did not show sex differences in the placebo condition. These results are particularly interesting in light of previous work that has shown similar pain stimuli (pressure pain) to be the stimulation most sensitive to sex differences. Results of this study suggest that the protocol employed (pressure pain stimulus with magnitude matching task) is sensitive to both anesthetic treatment and sex differences and represents an improvement in pain assessment methodology for use in experimental studies and in the clinic.",E,E

The remifentanil infusion rate was reduced by 50%, 5 min after tracheal intubation. Intraoperative stresses were treated with a remifentanil bolus (1 microgram kg-1) followed by an increase in the remifentanil infusion rate. At the insertion of the last suture, the remifentanil infusion and concomitant anaesthetic were switched off simultaneously. Times to spontaneous respiration, adequate respiration and tracheal extubation were significantly shorter in group I compared with group P (6.4 min vs 7.6 min, P < 0.01; 7.6 min vs 9.3, P < 0.003; 7.8 min vs 9.5 min, P < 0.015). Overall mean systolic blood pressures during surgery were greater in group P compared with group I (P < 0.05) but the absolute differences were clinically insignificant (4-5 mm Hg).",E,E

Our clinical experience with such a mixture in a thoracic epidural infusion after major surgery confirms this. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the effects on postoperative pain intensity, pain relief and side effects when removing adrenaline from this triple epidural mixture.; A prospective, randomised, double-blind, cross-over study was carried out in 24 patients after major thoracic or abdominal surgery. Patients with only mild pain when coughing during a titrated thoracic epidural infusion of about 10 ml.h-1 of bupivacaine 1 mg.ml-1, fentanyl 2 micrograms.ml-1, and adrenaline 2 micrograms.ml-1 were included. On the 1st and 2nd postoperative days each patient was given a double-blind epidural infusion, at the same rate, with or without adrenaline. The effect was observed for 4 h or until pain when coughing became unacceptable in spite of a rescue analgesic procedure. Rescue analgesia consisted of up to two epidural bolus injections per hour and i.v. morphine if necessary. All patients received rectal paracetamol 1 g, every 8 h. Fentanyl serum concentrations were measured with a radioimmunoassay technique at the start and end of each study period. Main outcome measures were extent of sensory blockade and pain intensity at rest and when coughing, evaluated by a visual analogue scale, a verbal categorical rating scale, the Prince Henry Hospital pain score, and an overall quality of pain relief score.; The number of hypaesthetic dermatomal segments decreased (P < 0.001) and pain intensity at rest and when coughing increased (P < 0.001) when adrenaline was omitted from the triple epidural mixture. This change started within the first hour after removing adrenaline. After 3 h pain intensity when coughing had increased to unacceptable levels in spite of rescue analgesia (epidural bolus injections and i.v. morphine). Within 15-20 min after restarting the triple epidural mixture with adrenaline, pain intensity was again reduced to mild pain when coughing. Serum concentration of fentanyl doubled from 0.22 to 0.45 ng.ml-1 (P < 0.01), and there was more sedation during the period without adrenaline.; Adrenaline increases sensory block and improves the pain-relieving effect of a mixture of bupivacaine and fentanyl infused epidurally at a thoracic level after major thoracic or abdominal surgery. Serum fentanyl concentrations doubled and sedation increased when adrenaline was removed from the epidural infusion, indicating more rapid vascular absorption and systemic effects of fentanyl.",E,E
9773443,Pathophysiological mechanisms of central neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury.,"Animals; Humans; Pain, Intractable; Spinal Cord Injuries","Eide, P K","After spinal cord injury (SCI), between 10% and 20% of the patients may develop central neuropathic pain. This type of chronic pain usually is a very bothersome sequel and represents a major therapeutic challenge since conventional medical and surgical pain therapies generally are ineffective. This review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of this pain syndrome. Important clinical features of central neuropathic pain after SCI include loss of sensations mediated by spinothalamic pathways combined with development of abnormal pain perception (spontaneous continuous pain and abnormally evoked pain). Up-regulation of neuronal activity leading to spontaneous and evoked neuronal hyperactivity/hyperexcitability, may be the neurophysiological substrate for development of abnormal pain perception. This paper describes some neurochemical changes that may be important for the induction and maintenance of neuronal hyperactivity and abnormal pain perception: Increased excitatory glutaminergic activity involving N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, may trigger the intracellular cascade reaction leading to upregulation of neuronal activity/excitability. Changes in voltage-sensitive Na+ channels may contribute to changes in nerve membrane excitability. Other important mechanisms may be loss of endogenous inhibition, including reduced gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)ergic, opioid and monoaminergic inhibition. These various mechanisms may provide new targets for treatment of a pain syndrome that traditionally has been so difficult to handle.",E,E

Fifty-two children aged between 1 and 12 years were randomly selected to receive caudal morphine, either 25 micrograms.kg-1 (Group A) or 50 micrograms.kg-1 (Group B) with 0.5 ml kg-1 of 0.25% plain bupivacaine immediately before surgery. They were monitored for 24 hours in a high dependency area for known complications of epidural morphine. There was no significant difference in postoperative analgesia between the two doses of caudal morphine. Clinically significant respiratory depression or sedation was not detected in either group. The occurrence of vomiting and pruritus was similar in both groups. Urinary retention was not recorded as all children had an indwelling catheter as required by the surgical procedure. We concluded that 25 micrograms.kg-1 of caudal morphine is as effective as 50 micrograms.kg-1 for providing postoperative analgesia in children undergoing urogenital surgery.",E,E

The intensity of pain before, during, and after the switching period was assessed through a four-point verbal Likert scale. The relationship between previous morphine dose and the final equianalgesic methadone dose, dose ratio between morphine and methadone, and the number of days required to achieve equianalgesia have been examined by means of Pearson's correlation coefficient, scatter plots, and Cuzick's test for trend respectively.; Before the switch, the median oral equivalent daily dose of morphine was 145 mg/d; after the switch, the median equianalgesic oral methadone dose was 21 mg/d. A median time of 3 days (range, 1 to 7 days) was necessary to achieve the equianalgesia with oral methadone; the lower the preswitching morphine dose, the fewer days necessary to achieve equianalgesia with oral methadone (P < .001). Dose ratios ranged from 2.5:1 to 14.3:1 (median, 7.75:1), which indicated that, in most cases, the dose ratio was much higher than that suggested by the published equianalgesic tables. A strong linear positive relationship between morphine and methadone equianalgesic doses was obtained (Pearson's correlation coefficient, 0.91). The dose ratio increased with the increase of the previous morphine dose with a much higher increase at low morphine doses.; The results of our study confirm that methadone is a potent opioid, more potent than believed. Caution is recommended when switching from any opioid to methadone, especially in patients who are tolerant to high doses of opioids.",3,E

To blind the study using available tablet strengths, the dose ratio of oxycodone to morphine was set at 1:1.5. On day 8, patients were crossed over to the alternate drug for 7 days. Pain intensity was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS 0 to 100 mm) and a categorical scale (CAT 0 to 4). Side effects were assessed using a checklist (four-point categorical severity) and a nondirected questionnaire. Patients and investigators made blinded global ratings of efficacy and treatment preference.; Twenty-three patients completed the study (10 men, 13 women).

Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) is undergoing investigation as a new treatment for breakthrough pain. The primary purpose of the study was to demonstrate that a single-unit dose of OTFC can safely and effectively treat breakthrough pain. A secondary goal was to determine appropriate dosing guidelines.; This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, dose-titration study in 62 adult cancer patients using transdermal fentanyl for persistent pain. Consenting patients provided 2 days of baseline data to evaluate the performance of their usual breakthrough pain medication. Patients then randomly received 200 microg or 400 microg OTFC in double-blind fashion. (Patients were always assigned, rather than randomized, to 200 microg if 400 microg represented > 20% of around-the-clock medication.) Pain intensity (PI), pain relief (PR), and global satisfaction scores were recorded. OTFC was then titrated until the patient received adequate PR for each episode using one OTFC unit. Orders to titrate up were ignored one third of the time to improve the blind. Two days of baseline data were compared with 2 days of OTFC data after titration identified an effective dose of OTFC.; Most patients (76%) found a safe and effective dose of OTFC. There was no meaningful relationship between the around-the-clock opioid regimen and the effective dose of OTFC. In open-label comparisons, OTFC produced a faster onset of relief and a greater degree of PR than patients' usual breakthrough medication. Somnolence, nausea, and dizziness were the most common side effects associated with OTFC.; Most patients find a single OTFC dosage that adequately treats breakthrough pain. The optimal dose is found by titration and is not predicted by around-the-clock dose of opioids.",E,E

The surgical minimally invasive alternative is thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy. In 7 patients pain was scored on a scale from 1 (no pain) to 10 (maximal pain) before and after surgery and weekly thereafter. Five bilateral and 2 left-sided thoracoscopic splanchnicectomies were performed. Operation time was 17 +/- 3 min for each side.

Pharmacokinetics of sustained release morphine.,"Administration, Oral; Administration, Rectal; Analgesics, Opioid; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Child; Delayed-Action Preparations; Food-Drug Interactions; Humans; Morphine; Pain","Gourlay, G K","There are a number of modified release formulations of morphine with recommended dosage intervals of either 12 or 24 hours, including tablets (MS Contin, Oramorph SR), capsules (Kapanol, Skenan), suspension and suppositories. Orally administered solid dosage forms are most popular but significant differences exist in the resultant pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence status of morphine after both single doses and at steady state. Following single doses, the plasma morphine concentrations showed pronounced differences in the 0- to 12-hour period with a 4- to 5-fold difference in the mean peak concentration (Cmax) for morphine and the time to Cmax (tmax) The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 24 hours for the 4 formulations show greater similarity. None of the formulations were shown to be bioequivalent according to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria. At steady state, fluctuations in plasma morphine concentrations throughout a 12-hour dosage interval were greatest for MS Contin and least for Kapanol. In fact, the relatively small fluctuations in plasma morphine concentrations following Kapanol administration suggested the same formulation could successfully be used with a 24-hour dosage interval. The pharmacokinetic parameters of morphine following Kapanol once daily were similar to MS Contin (12 hours) with the obvious exception of the longer tmax. There is also another once daily oral morphine preparation (MXL) which has been shown to be bioequivalent to Kapanol under fasting conditions only in a single dose study in volunteers. Food has been shown to have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of morphine following doses of immediate release solution and the modified release preparations. However, bioequivalence is generally maintained between the fed and fasting states for most preparations. MS Contin tablets have been administered rectally, but morphine pharmacokinetic parameters show greater variability compared with oral administration and the 2 routes are not bioequivalent. The results suggest a slower rate but greater extent of morphine adsorption. Somewhat similar results were obtained when Kapanol granules are administered rectally. The morphine pharmacokinetics following administration of a specifically formulated controlled release suppository showed less variability (rectal bioavailability was 42%). The pronounced differences in morphine pharmacokinetics between the various formulations are not translated into measurable differences in the pharmacodynamic effects of pain relief and adverse effects. The lack of bioequivalence between some of the formulations suggests that care should be exercised if physicians change modified release formulations as dosage adjustments may be necessary in some patients.",E,E

Fast frame renography is a non-invasive means of imaging ureteric peristalsis and renal drainage. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of each of these drugs on the drainage pattern of the upper tracts. Twelve normal male volunteers were studied. All underwent a standard fast frame renogram using 75 MBq of technetium-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine, and were then administered either 100 mg pethidine or 75 mg diclofenac by intramuscular injection. Fast frame renography was then repeated. Peristalsis was determined from the condensed image of each ureter and the renogram curves were analysed to obtain standard parameters and deconvolution analysis. Diclofenac caused a profound disruption to both ureteric peristalsis and the renogram curve. This effect was not seen after the administration of pethidine. Deconvolution analysis suggests the effects of diclofenac are mediated via a direct effect on drainage rather than by any alteration of blood flow to the kidney. This study suggests that pethidine is the analgesic of choice prior to renography and that inferences about alterations of drainage in the presence of diclofenac should be interpreted with care.",E,E

J. Hazucha, D. V. Bates, and P. A. Bromberg. J. Appl. Physiol. 67: 1535-1541, 1989). If this were so, pain suppression or inhibition by opioid-receptor agonists should partially or fully reverse O3-induced symptomatic and lung functional responses. The objectives of this study were to determine whether O3-induced pain limits maximal inspiration and whether endogenous opioids contribute to modulation of the effects of inhaled O3 on lung function. The participants in this double-blind crossover study were healthy volunteers (18-59 yr) known to be ""weak"" (WR; n = 20) and ""strong"" O3 responders (SR; n = 42). They underwent either two 2-h exposures to air or two 2-h exposures to 0. 42 parts/million O3 with moderate intermittent exercise. Immediately after post-O3 spirometry, the WR were randomly given either naloxone (0.15 mg/kg iv) or saline, whereas SR randomly received either sufentanil (0.2 microgram/kg iv) or saline. O3 exposure significantly (P < 0.001) impaired lung function. In SR, sufentanil rapidly, although not completely, reversed both the chest pain and spirometric effects (forced expiratory volume in 1 s; P < 0.0001) compared with saline. Immediate postexposure administration of saline or naloxone had no significant effect on WR. Plasma beta-endorphin levels were not related to an individual's O3 responsiveness. Cutaneous pain variables showed a nonsignificant weak association with O3 responsiveness. These observations demonstrate that nociceptive mechanisms play a key role in modulating O3-induced inhibition of inspiration but not in causing lack of spirometric response to O3 exposure in WR.",E,E

Pain intensity was recorded using verbal rating pain scales (VRPS). Cases without adequate analgesia (VRPS > 4) or could not tolerate the pain, additional bolus of fentanyl 25 micrograms were given until adequate analgesia was achieved. Side effects were recorded as well.; No significant differences were found among groups in demographic data, VRPS, number of total shock waves, cases with supplementary fentanyl, mean dose of supplementary fentanyl or the incidence of dizziness.

All patients received a fast-track cardiac anesthetic regimen. Patients underwent a structured interview by a research nurse 18 h after extubation. A standard set of questions was asked during this interview to determine if the patient had explicit memory of any event from induction of anesthesia to recovery of consciousness.; Nine patients did not complete a postoperative interview because of death (n = 7) or postoperative confusion (n = 2). The last memory before surgery reported in 420 (69.1%) patients was waiting in the holding area at the operating suite, and in the remaining 188 (30.9%) patients it was lying on the operating table before induction of anesthesia. Two patients (0.3%) had explicit memory of intraoperative events. One of the two patients also had explicit memory of pain. Neither patient reported adverse psychological sequelae.; The authors report an incidence of awareness in fast-track cardiac anesthesia of 0.3%. This is the lowest incidence of awareness currently reported during cardiac surgery.

Recently, denervation of sympathetic pain afferents from the pancreas by surgical splanchnicectomy has shown promise in relieving pain while preserving residual pancreatic function. However, results from surgical splanchnicectomy have been mixed in large part because of patient selection. Differentiating actual pancreatic pain from ""pancreatic"" pain caused by drug-seeking behavior, psychogenic diseases, or various somatically innervated conditions is clinically challenging at best. Between 1992 and 1996, twenty-two patients with 20 prior pancreatic operations, ""small duct"" chronic pancreatitis, and ""pancreatic"" pain requiring narcotics were evaluated. Each underwent differential epidural analgesia (DEA) using the following standard techniques: placebo, low-dose (sympathetic), and high-dose (somatic) blocks. Pain perceptions were recorded before and after DEA using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Six demonstrated a greater than 50% decrease in VAS pain after placebo injection and were eliminated from further study. In the remaining 16 patients, pain relief only occurred with sympathetic or somatic blockade. Greater and lesser splanchnicectomy (surgical splanchnicectomy) was performed 27 times in these 16 patients (11 bilateral, 6 synchronous) (5 unilateral; 2 right and 3 left) using thoracoscopic techniques in 14 patients and open thoracotomy in two. No significant surgical or anesthetic complications were encountered. Surgical splanchnicectomy resulted in an overall significant reduction in preoperative VAS scores (8.25 to 4.18; P <0.05). Ten of 13 patients with DEA-predicted sympathetic pain experienced a greater than 50% decrease in VAS after surgical splanchnicectomy, but only two had complete relief. None of the three patients with DEA-predicted somatic pain were benefited by splanchnicectomy. During an average follow-up of 23.3 months, initial good results from surgical splanchnicectomy were maintained in 8 of 10 patients. The following conclusions were reached: (1) surgical splanchnicectomy is a safe, often effective technique for amelioration of intractable pain from ""small duct"" chronic pancreatitis and (2) DEA is a promising approach for identifying patients most likely to respond to surgical splanchnicectomy.",E,E

Patients received CR oxycodone tablets every 12 hr in a manner that reflected typical clinical practice. Supplemental immediate-release (IR) oxycodone was available PRN for breakthrough pain. Patients recorded medication use, adverse events, and evaluations of pain intensity and acceptability of therapy in a daily diary. Forty-four patients (51%) completed all 12 weeks of study; 43 patients (49%) discontinued participation. At baseline and throughout the study period, the overall mean pain-intensity score was slight to moderate. A comparison of initial and final doses showed a significant but modest increase in total daily CR oxycodone dose. An increase or decrease in titration of the oxycodone dose occurred for 66 patients (84%) at least once during the 12-week study period, primarily for increased pain. Forty-four patients (56%) did not undergo dose titration when the latter was indicated. Half of the patients used IR oxycodone rescue almost daily; the mean number of rescue doses per day was 1.5. Despite stable pain control and an increasing total daily CR oxycodone dose, the percentage of patients reporting common opioid-related adverse events decreased over the course of the study. CR oxycodone tablets administered every 12 hr were successfully used to manage cancer pain over a 12-week period.

Patients were randomized to receive either intramuscular ketorolac supplemented by oral oxycodone, or intravenous morphine via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device, for postoperative analgesia. Patients were monitored for 2 hours in the recovery room, then every 4 hours until discharge, for the presence of complications of nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, pruritus, and dizziness. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) on the morning of postoperative day one. All patients were discharged by 24 hours after surgery. Ten (20%) of the patients receiving ketorolac/oxycodone versus 31 (79%) of those receiving PCA morphine experienced postoperative complications (P < .05). Postoperative nausea, vomiting, and urinary retention were each significantly more common in the PCA morphine group (P < .05). The incidence of pruritus and dizziness was low overall. There was no significant difference between groups in the severity of postoperative pain as assessed using a VAS. We conclude that ketorolac/oxycodone may provide comparable analgesia with fewer undesirable side effects than PCA morphine in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

All patients then were assigned to a titrated dose of opioids for 16 weeks and then gradually tapered off their medication for 12 weeks. Finally, all participants were monitored for a 1-month posttreatment washout period. Each patient was called once a week for a report on pain, activity, mood, medication, hours awake, and adverse effects and was monitored carefully for signs of abuse and noncompliance.; Weekly reports during the experimental phase showed the titrated-dose group to have less pain (P < 0.001) and less emotional distress (P < 0.001) than the other two groups. Both opioid groups were significantly different from the naproxen-only group. During the titration phase, patients also reported significantly less pain and improved mood. Few differences were found in activity or hours asleep, or between average pretreatment and posttreatment phone-interview and questionnaire variables.

Epidural local anesthetics may contribute to an increase in operative deliveries by decreasing perineal sensation and causing motor weakness. Operative delivery rates might be reduced with CSE, by avoiding or delaying administration of local anesthetics. This study compares the operative delivery rates associated with a CSE technique and those associated with intravenous meperidine for labor analgesia.; Healthy parturients at full term were assigned randomly to receive CSE or intravenous meperidine analgesia. The CSE group received 10 microg intrathecal sufentanil, followed by epidural bupivacaine and fentanyl at their next request for analgesia. Parturients receiving intravenous meperidine had 50 mg on demand (maximum, 200 mg in 4 h). Labor and delivery outcomes in both groups were recorded and compared.; An intent-to-treat analysis of 1,223 women indicated that CSE does not increase the rate of cesarean delivery for dystocia in nulliparous and parous women (CSE, 3.5% vs. intravenous meperidine, 4; P=not significant) or in nulliparous women alone (CSE, 7% vs. intravenous meperidine, 8%; P=not significant).

A neurologic assessment of breast-fed neonates was made at 2 and 48 h of life. Plasma fentanyl concentrations were determined in a subset of patients at intervals after treatment.; Patients receiving fentanyl alone made more attempts at patient-controlled analgesia (P < 0.01), required a greater total dose of fentanyl (P < 0.01), reported more pain (P < 0.003) and less satisfaction (P < 0.003), and had more nausea and urinary retention (P < 0.05) than all other groups.

Motor blockade or orthostatic hypotension did not develop in any patient, and all patients could ambulate without difficulty. Neurobehavioral scores, which were similar among all neonates, were within the normal range. Plasma concentrations of fentanyl increased after epinephrine-containing solutions were discontinued.; During the conditions of this study, the addition of epinephrine and bupivacaine to a 3-microg/ml epidural fentanyl solution for postcesarean section pain relief provided superior analgesia compared with fentanyl alone or fentanyl with epinephrine.

Doses were adjusted to provide satisfactory analgesia in both treatment groups. Pain at rest and with movement, functional recovery, drug side effects, and patient satisfaction were measured using rating scales and questionnaires. The costs of PCA and intramuscular therapy were calculated based on personnel time and drug and material requirements.; Comparable analgesia was observed with the two treatment methods, with no significant differences in the incidence of side effects or patient satisfaction. The medication dosage had to be adjusted significantly more frequently in the intramuscular group than in the PCA patients. The PCA did not favor a faster recuperation time compared with intramuscular therapy in terms of times to ambulation, resumption of liquid and solid diet, passage of bowel gas, or hospital discharge. The results of the economic evaluation, which used a cost-minimization model and sensitivity analyses, showed that PCA was more costly than regular intramuscular injections despite the fact that no costs for the pump were included in the analyses. Cost differences in nursing time favoring PCA were offset by drug and material costs associated with this type of treatment.; Compared with regularly scheduled intramuscular dosing, PCA is more costly and does not have clinical advantages for pain management after hysterectomy.

Preemptive analgesia is a priority trend in the treatment of acute postoperative pain. The most prevalent method of postoperative analgesia is prolonged opioid epidural analgesia carried out in intensive care wards and other wards by an acute pain management team. For treating patients with chronic painful syndromes, protocols of initial clinical and diagnostic evaluation are developed, permitting the choice of individual treatment strategy. Differentiated complex drug therapy planned with consideration for individual course of the painful syndrome is the basis of treating patients with phantom pain syndrome. Algorithms of differentiated therapy of radicular and spondylogenic pain are designed. Stage-by-stage analysis of treatment efficacy is carried out using modern electrophysiological methods. Realization of the proposed organization principles improved the efficacy of postoperative analgesia to 88.2%, prevented the development of postoperative painful syndrome in 35.6% cases, decreased the incidence of phantom pain syndrome after amputation of the limb from 63.3 to 31.6% and increased the efficacy of this syndrome treatment to 70.1%, and increased the efficacy of treating vertebrogenic painful syndromes to 82.3%.",E,E

We describe a case of severe cancer pain where these medications were used successfully by continuous intrathecal infusion and patient controlled intrathecal analgesia.",E,E

Different types of placebo analgesic responses were evoked by means of cognitive expectation cues, drug conditioning, or a combination of both. Drug conditioning was performed by means of either the opioid agonist morphine hydrochloride or the nonopioid ketorolac tromethamine. Expectation cues produced placebo responses that were completely blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone. Expectation cues together with morphine conditioning produced placebo responses that were completely antagonized by naloxone. Morphine conditioning alone (without expectation cues) induced a naloxone-reversible placebo effect. By contrast, ketorolac conditioning together with expectation cues elicited a placebo effect that was blocked by naloxone only partially. Ketorolac conditioning alone produced placebo responses that were naloxone-insensitive. Therefore, we evoked different types of placebo responses that were either naloxone-reversible or partially naloxone-reversible or, otherwise, naloxone-insensitive, depending on the procedure used to evoke the placebo response. These findings show that cognitive factors and conditioning are balanced in different ways in placebo analgesia, and this balance is crucial for the activation of opioid or nonopioid systems. Expectation triggers endogenous opioids, whereas conditioning activates specific subsystems. In fact, if conditioning is performed with opioids, placebo analgesia is mediated via opioid receptors, if conditioning is performed with nonopioid drugs, other nonopioid mechanisms result to be involved.",E,E

We have conducted a randomized, double-blind trial to assess the morphine-sparing effect of intravenous lignocaine in patients with acute pain. After major abdominal surgery, patients were treated with post-operative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia in two groups: group M (n = 25, morphine 0.2 mg mL-1) and group ML (n = 25, morphine 0.2 mg mL-1 plus lignocaine 3.2 mg mL-1). The patient-controlled analgesia system was programmed to deliver a 5 mL bolus with a 50 mL per 4 h limit; the lockout time was 10 min. Both groups closely resembled each other in terms of demographic data, pain intensity, cumulative morphine dose and the morphine-associated nausea, vomiting and pruritus. However, the sedation scores in group ML patients during the first post-operative day were significantly greater than those in group M. The incidence of lignocaine-related lightheadedness and dry mouth was also significantly greater in group ML than in group M. It was concluded that the addition of lignocaine 3.2 mg mL-1 to morphine 0.2 mg mL-1 given via patient-controlled analgesia system does not provide a post-operative morphine-sparing analgesic effect.",E,E

For combined spinal-epidural analgesia 1 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% with 25 micrograms of fentanyl were injected into the subarachnoid space. For both groups subsequent top-ups of 10 ml of bupivacaine 0.1% with fentanyl 20 micrograms were given using a lightweight patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) pump with a lockout time of 30 min. We assessed analgesia and the degree of motor blockade and found no significant differences in pain or maternal satisfaction scores between the two groups. The time to first top-up was significantly longer in the epidural group than in the CSE group (p = 0.01). The combined spinal-epidural group had significantly greater motor blockade at 30 min than the epidural group (p = 0.01), but there was no difference after this. The PCEA machine failed completely twice and temporarily many times. We conclude that the combined spinal-epidural technique confers no advantages in early active labour.

Children, ASA 1-2 between 2 and 10 years, presenting for inguinal surgery were studied. Once a steady state for halothane was reached, baseline recordings of end-tidal carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute volume, blood pressure and pulse rate were recorded. Intravenous tramadol 1 mg.kg-1 (T1) or 2 mg.kg-1 (T2) or pethidine 1 mg.kg-1 (PE) or placebo (PL) was then given according to a computer-generated randomisation. Further sets of recordings were taken at 5-min intervals for 20 min prior to commencement of surgery. The rate of recovery was assessed according to Aldrete scoring and the time and need for further analgesia were noted. The postoperative pain intensity was scored by means of a five-point verbal rating scale hourly for 6 h. Eighty-eight children, 22 per group, were studied. The mean age, weight and height were similar in each group. There was a statistically significant difference between the maximum decrease in respiratory rate and increase in end-tidal carbon dioxide between group PE and groups T1/T2 (p < 0.001). Thirteen episodes of apnoea occurred in the PE group, 11 requiring naloxone. The mean respiratory rate was lowest 5 min after injection in all groups. There was a slow increase in respiratory rate until incision in groups T1 and T2. Respiratory rate remained almost unchanged in PL until incision. The decreases in respiratory rate were reflected by increases in end-tidal carbon dioxide, the highest being recorded in the PE group. A lower intensity of pain in the first 2 h was noted in the three opioid groups. During the first 6 h, the proportion of patients requiring a further dose of analgesia was highest in PL and lowest in T2. Tramadol appears safe for use in children.",E,E

Participants were volunteer ED patients with a diagnosis of ureterolithiasis confirmed by intravenous pyelogram. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive a single intramuscular injection of either 60 mg ketorolac or 100 to 150 mg meperidine, based on weight. Of the 70 patients completing the trial, 33 received ketorolac and 37 received meperidine. Demographic characteristics and baseline pain scores of both groups were comparable (P = NS, Mann Whitney U). Ketorolac was significantly (P < .05) more effective than meperidine in reducing renal colic at 40, 60, and 90 minutes as measured on a 10-cm visual analogue scale. Similar proportions of patients in each group were given rescue analgesia and admitted. Of patients who were discharged home without rescue, those treated with ketorolac left the ED significantly earlier than those treated with meperidine (3.46 v 4.33 h, P < .05). These results show that intramuscular ketorolac as a single agent for renal colic is more effective than meperidine and promotes earlier discharge of renal colic patients from the ED.",E,E

The present study surveys 593 cancer patients treated by a pain service following the WHO guidelines for relief of cancer pain. Of these, 380 presented with nociceptive, 32 with neuropathic and 181 with mixed (nociceptive and neuropathic) pain. In patients with nociceptive, mixed and neuropathic pain, the average duration of evaluated pain treatment was 51, 53 and 38 days, respectively. Non-opioid or opioid analgesics were given to 99%, 96% and 79%, antidepressants to 8%, 25% and 19%, anticonvulsants to 2%, 22% and 38% and corticosteroids to 26%, 35% and 22% of patients, respectively. Systemic analgesia was supported by palliative antineoplastic treatment (48%, 56% and 38% of patients), nerve blocks (3%, 6% and 6%), psychotherapy (3%, 7% and 3%), physiotherapy (6%, 12% and 13%) and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (1%, 6% and 6%). Analgesic treatment resulted in a significant pain relief in all groups of patients, as the mean pain intensity (NRS) decreased from 66 (nociceptive), 65 (mixed) and 70 (neuropathic) on admission to 26, 30 and 28 after 3 days and 18, 17 and 21 at the end of survey. The total outcome of pain treatment was not predicted by the designation to nociceptive, mixed or neuropathic pain. In conclusion, neuropathic cancer pain is not intractable and can be relieved in the majority of patients by treatment following the WHO guidelines.",E,E

We developed another pain model, postpartum resection of the fallopian tubes for sterilisation, in which each patient serves as her own control when one side is infiltrated with the active drug (in this study sufentanil 5 mg) and the contralateral side with normal saline. In the control group both sides are infiltrated with plain saline. After 30 min from the end of anaesthesia onwards, 26 out of 30 patients observed significant pain relief on the side of the sufentanil infiltration, which in 11 patients lasted until the end of the observation period 24 h postoperatively; no difference was observed in the control group. In our pain model with a high assay sensitivity, the infiltration of one side with the lipophilic test drug, sufentanil, caused local analgesia in primarily non-inflamed tissue. The use of each patient as her own control excluded inter-subject bias.; The capability of opioid receptor agonists to reduce postoperative sterilization pain was investigated in 30 women who underwent postpartum tubal ligation (Pomeroy method) at Tampere (Finland) University Hospital.  Using each patient as her own control eliminated inter-subject bias.  One side of the fallopian tube was infiltrated with 5 mg of sufentanil and the contralateral side was infiltrated with physiologic saline.  The results confirmed the importance of inflammation in the development of the peripheral antinociceptive action of opioid receptor agonists.  The analgesic effect of sufentanil was not yet evident in some patients 15 minutes after the end of anesthesia administration.  However, after 30 minutes from the end of anesthesia, 26 out of 30 women reported significant pain relief on the side of the sufentanil infiltration.  In 11 of these women, pain relief lasted for at least 24 hours.",E,E
9929793,Analgesia for trauma and burns.,Analgesia; Analgesics; Burns; Critical Care; Humans; Multiple Trauma; Pain,"Hedderich, R; Ness, T J","This article has described the physiologic impact of trauma- and burn-related pain as well as the effect of a clinician's choice of analgesic method, using the specific example of regional analgesia for pain caused by chest trauma. It has been observed that trauma exerts a holistic influence upon the organism, marshalling reflexes, multi-system physiologic stress responses, and psychologic responses--some adaptive and others maladaptive. There is reason to consider that timely analgesia can intervene in this dynamic process and interdict the establishment of a debilitated state. A key finding of these studies is that a report of pain relief may not be the best outcome measure since the choice of analgesic method(s) has a significant impact on the secondary effects of pain. Although extrapolated from studies of perioperative pain, findings do suggest that there may be a critical period of time during which the secondary effects of a painful stimulus may be attenuated or reversed. How long this period of reversibility exists has not been determined, so planning for the level and goals of analgesia intervention should occur early on. Analgesia should be viewed not only as a humanitarian gesture, but also a therapeutic maneuver with the goal being the early restoration of function and the mitigation of a chronic debilitated state. There is scattered evidence that regional analgesic techniques using local anesthetics have some advantages over other analgesic modalities, particularly in the trauma patient with pulmonary compromise; however, as with other medical interventions, one should develop a strategic plan of application which includes consideration of potential complications and side effects, in addition to the potential therapeutic effects. The traumatized body, as well as the attending physician, must deal with inflammation, the neurohumoral reaction, musculoskeletal reflex responses, and numerous other reactions designed to stabilize an acutely destabilized systemic entity. Multimodal analgesia, with the balanced use of systemic and regional medications, has given the best short- and long-term results in studies of postthoracotomy pain. The use of a similar combined plan for posttraumatic analgesia seems logical; however, many questions remain as yet unanswered. In particular, what are the optimal combinations of techniques/medications to employ to maximize analgesia and minimize secondary effects of trauma? Can an aggressive multimodal approach intervene effectively in the development of chronic pain states, and if so, for how long? What are the long-term benefits to be derived from making a significant impact on the stress response? Last, but not least, can analgesic interventions be shown to be cost-effective according to current societal pressures to reduce the cost of health care? These and other questions are not easy to answer. Trauma strikes, in a variable fashion, patients of all ages, with all forms of comorbidity, and is treated by a technology that continues to evolve. Previous research related to the effects of analgesic treatments has been hampered by the limitations that arise when isolated groups embark on vast projects with limited numbers of patients available. It is time for investigators at multiple centers to embark on coordinated efforts to address long-term questions related to trauma and the therapeutic efficacy of analgesia.",E,E

The severity of pain was assessed with physiological parameters, a behavioral pain scale, and stress hormone concentrations before and 2 and 24 hours after the start of treatment.; The analgesic effect was similar in both groups, as judged by the pain scale. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations decreased significantly from 0 to 24 hours in both groups. Median adrenaline decrease was 0.5 nmol/L (interquartile range [IQR] 1.1;0.0) in the fentanyl and 0.7 nmol/L (IQR 1.3;0.1) in the morphine group, noradrenaline 2.1 nmol/L (IQR 9.0;0.2), and 3.0 nmol/L (IQR 7. 5;0.3), respectively. beta-endorphin decreased significantly only in the fentanyl group ( 14 pmol/L (IQR 28; 7), P <.05). Decreased gastrointestinal motility was less frequent in the fentanyl group (23% vs 47%, P <.01).; With at least as effective analgesia as with morphine, fentanyl had fewer side effects.

Thirty participants reported successful pain relief during trial and were implanted with an intraspinal delivery system. Standardized measures of pain and functional status were assessed before treatment was begun and at defined intervals during the subsequent 24 months. Intrathecal opioid use and pharmacological and device-related complications were also monitored.; The participants had a mean age of 58 +/- 13 years and a mean pain duration of 8 +/- 9 years. Fifty-three percent of the study participants were women. Pain type was characterized as mixed neuropathic-nociceptive (15 of 30 patients, 50%), peripheral neuropathic (10 of 30 patients, 33%), deafferentation (4 of 30 patients, 13%), or nociceptive (1 of 30 patients, 3%). Forty-seven percent of the patients were diagnosed with failed back surgery syndrome. Significant improvement over baseline levels of visual analog scale pain was measured at each follow-up examination after implant. Overall, 50% (11 of 22 patients) of the population reported at least a 25% reduction in visual analog scale pain after 24 months of treatment. In addition, the McGill Pain Questionnaire, visual analog scale measures of functional improvement and pain coping, and several subscales of the Chronic Illness Problem Inventory showed improvement throughout the follow-up period.

Sixty-four patients rated as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 1 to 3 who underwent MRM surgery were included in the study. In TEA group patients, 2% lidocaine (15-20 ml) was administered via the epidural route as primary anesthesia, in conjunction with midazolam (5-10 mg) and fentanyl (<250 microg) for amnesia. The GA patients were maintained with isoflurane and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen. After operation the patients were given pethidine (1 mg/kg IM) as required for pain relief. The time to first pethidine requirement, total pethidine consumption, worst pain score, bed rest time, satisfaction score, and anesthesia-related side effects were recorded for 2 days after surgery. The results show that TEA provided a more prolonged analgesic effect than GA after operation. A longer time to first pethidine requirement (19.2 +/- 1.5 vs. 7.6 +/- 2.5 hours) (p < 0. 001) and decreased pethidine consumption (17.2 +/- 7.0 vs. 76.3 +/- 17.4 mg) (p < 0.001) were observed in the TEA group than in the GA group, respectively. A worse visual analog scale (VAS) pain score was observed in the GA group (5.7 +/- 0.6) than in TEA patients (4.3 +/- 0.4) (p < 0.01). The average bed rest time was significantly shorter in the TEA group (16.9 +/- 0.9 hours) (p < 0.01) than in the GA group (27.1 +/- 4.1 hours). Overall satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the TEA group (4.4 +/- 0.1) (p < 0.01) than in the GA group (3.5 +/- 0.2). Side effects were observed at a higher frequency in the GA group (16/32) (p < 0.0001) than in the TEA group (3/32).

This retrospective study reports the analgesic effects of intrathecal morphine sulfate by implanted infusion pumps in nine patients with unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.; Nine patients were implanted over a 2-year period. Preoperative morphine i.v. equivalents were a mean of 81.51 mg/day, with a range of 20-140 mg/day. Patients were hospitalized for a trial dose of 1-2 mg of intrathecal Duramorph, 1 mg/ml, via lumbar puncture to assess whether adequate pain relief could be achieved and whether there would be drug-related side effects.; All patients who received a trial dose experienced excellent pain relief, and subsequently underwent implantation of a lumbar subarachnoid catheter and infusion pump during the same hospitalization. The mean number of days from diagnosis to pump implant was 119, with a range of 3-587 days. The mean maximum daily dose was 21.28 mg, with a range of 3-73.10 mg. No patient experienced respiratory depression or excess sedation which prevented achievement of pain control. Minor supplemental narcotic use was documented in three of the nine patients. Assessment of pain control was made by the level of activity and the analog pain scale, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable. All of the patients experienced good to excellent relief of pain. The mean duration of intrathecal morphine sulfate use until death was 137.3 days, with a range of 52-354 days.; This series of nine patients indicates that long-term administration of intrathecal morphine via implanted infusion pump in patients with pancreatic cancer is both efficacious and safe.

Only 12% admitted to having enough background to treat chronic pain. Sixty-five percent of the respondents admitted to know no method at all for pain evaluation, while 82% had never applied any in their clinical practice. About half the respondents (42%) did not know any guidelines for the management of pediatric pain, although 75% considered they would be very useful. A high percentage of pediatricians answered that analgesia was required before performing certain diagnostic or therapeutic procedures (lumbar puncture, venous canalization, arterial puncture and others), but differences in relation to age, sex and clinical setting of the physicians were detected in these responses. The most used drug for the treatment of moderate acute pain is acetaminophen (88%), for severe acute pain metamizol (58%) and for severe chronic pain acetaminophen-codeine (37%). Only 48% admitted to having used opioids.; Pediatricians in this society seem to be too confident about the topic of acute pain management in their patients, even though they report a lack of training which could influence the quality of the care they are offering to their patients.
