10067807,"Migraine: a ""woman's disease?"".",Female; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Sex Factors; Women's Health,"Warshaw, L J; Lipton, R B; Silberstein, S D","Migraine, a chronic disorder characterized by episodes of headache, has a profound effect on the well-being and general functioning of its victims, not only during the acute attacks, but also in terms of impairment of school achievement, work performance, and family/social relationships. Despite staggering social and economic costs, it remains under-diagnosed and under-treated worldwide. Migraine has been labeled a ""woman's disease"" because it is three times more common in women than men, the attacks tend to be more severe and disabling among women and, in some women, they seem to be modulated by such hormonal ""milestones"" as menarche, menstruation, pregnancy and menopause. After a brief review of the diagnosis of migraine, this article will examine the nuances responsible for that label and their implications for treatment.",E,E

Because the efficacy and tolerability of abortive and prophylactic treatment options for menstrual migraine have generally not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials, treatment choices are often made on the basis of personal experience and anecdotal reports. This article reviews evidence from retrospective analyses and prospective studies showing that sumatriptan injection and tablets are effective and well tolerated in menstrual migraine. (1) Sumatriptan injection 6 mg was as effective in the treatment of menstrual migraine attacks as it was for nonmenstrual attacks in a retrospective analysis of data from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials (n = 1104). In the menstrual migraine group, 80% of women treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg compared with 19% of placebo-treated patients reported headache relief 1 h postdose (p < 0.001). (2) Sumatriptan injection 6 mg was effective in the acute treatment of menstrual migraine attacks in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, two-attack study (n = 226). Across the two attacks, 70-71% of patients treating menstrual migraine attacks with sumatriptan injection 6 mg compared with 22-24% of placebo-treated patients reported headache relief 1 h postdose (p < 0.001). (3) Sumatriptan tablets 100 mg were effective in the acute treatment of menstrual migraine attacks in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in women diagnosed with menstrual migraine (n = 115). For menstrual migraine attacks, headache relief 4 h postdose was reported by 67% of sumatriptan-treated patients compared with 33% of placebo-treated patients. Sumatriptan injection and tablets were generally well tolerated in these studies, in which adverse events were characteristic of those typically observed in sumatriptan acute migraine clinical trials. These data demonstrate that sumatriptan injection and tablets are effective and well tolerated in the treatment of menstrual migraine.",E,E
10160470,Comparing dihydroergotamine mesylate and sumatriptan in the management of acute migraine. A retrospective cost-efficacy analysis.,Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Dihydroergotamine; Humans; Middle Aged; Migraine Disorders; Retrospective Studies; Sumatriptan; Vasoconstrictor Agents,"Payne, K; Kozma, C M; Lawrence, B J","The annual cost of managing migraine totals billions of US dollars. This retrospective economic analysis of a clinical trial comparing subcutaneous dihydroergotamine mesylate (DHE) with subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of acute migraine is appropriate because, although each product has been shown to be efficacious, the acquisition cost of sumatriptan is over 3 times that of DHE. Total costs in each treatment group were calculated and applied independently to 11 clinical trial efficacy measures. Three of the efficacy measures showed no statistically significant difference between treatment arms, leading to a decision to use the less expensive DHE. In 4 of the efficacy measures. DHE was the obvious choice because it is more efficacious and less expensive. For the final 4 efficacy measures, where sumatriptan is more efficacious and more expensive, incremental cost-efficacy ratios were calculated to determine the additional expenditure required to achieve outcomes associated with quick relief. Depending on the efficacy variable chosen and the assumptions used in the model, the incremental cost-efficacy ratios ranged from $US4000 to $US6700 per year (1993 dollars) for each additional patient who is successfully treated with sumatriptan compared with DHE. Therefore, in a population of 100 migraineurs, an additional 13 to 22 patients would achieve these short term benefits of sumatriptan, although it would cost an additional $US88 395 annually, given the assumptions made. Because each product has unique advantages, we conclude that the more cost-efficacious product is dependent on the outcome of interest and the amount that the patient or provider is willing to pay to achieve that outcome.",2,E
10166407,The impact of drug therapy on quality of life in headache and migraine.,Headache; Health Care Costs; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Quality of Life,"Solomon, G D; Litaker, D G","Although headache is among the most common and costly disorders in primary care, our understanding of its direct impact on the quality of life of affected individuals is incomplete. While studies evaluating the role of headache on health-related quality of life and healthcare economics are starting to appear in the medical literature, the effect of pharmacotherapy in improving quality of life is only beginning to be studied. At present, studies evaluating health-related quality of life in patients with migraine who are undergoing treatment are limited to 3 agents: sumatriptan, flurbiprofen and diclofenac. Several studies have consistently indicated that these drugs benefit patients by improving key dimensions of health-related quality of life or patients' sense of well-being to a significant extent. Given the magnitude of functional and emotional impairment associated with chronic headache disorders, assessing patients' perceptions of their quality of life makes a useful contribution to the evaluation of therapeutic interventions and should supplement traditional clinical endpoints in determining the effectiveness of new drugs.",I,E
10168035,Sumatriptan. A pharmacoeconomic review of its use in migraine.,"Economics, Pharmaceutical; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Sumatriptan","Coukell, A J; Lamb, H M","Migraine is a common illness characterised by severe, often throbbing and/or unilateral headache, which may be accompanied by sensitivity to light or noise. A minority of migraine attacks are preceded by transient visual or sensory disturbances. Migraine is associated with reductions in health-related quality of life both during and between attacks. Despite methodological limitations in cost-of-illness studies, it is clear that the cost of migraine to society is substantial. Indirect costs (primarily workplace productivity losses) make up 75 to 90% of total costs. Direct costs, such as the cost of drug treatment, physician consultation, hospitalisation and emergency room treatment, make up most of the remainder. Sumatriptan is an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of migraine. Its main advantage over other agents used in the acute management of migraine appears to be its rapid onset of action. Sumatriptan reduces headache severity within 2 hours of oral administration in 50 to 67% of patients and within 1 hour of subcutaneous administration in 70 to 80% of patients. Headache recurs in approximately 40% of patients who initially respond to oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan; however, a second dose of the drug is effective against the symptoms of recurrence in a majority of patients. Some patients experience relief of non-headache migraine symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia. Adverse events reported after sumatriptan are generally mild and transient. Data from studies of patients who used their usual therapies and sumatriptan in nonblinded, sequential phases indicate that both workplace and nonworkplace productivity losses were reduced during sumatriptan therapy. A cost-benefit analysis applied to some of these workplace productivity data indicated that, including direct costs and productivity savings, sumatriptan was associated with a net reduction in total cost of migraine. In retrospective cost analyses, sumatriptan was associated with increased prescription costs: the effect of the drug on other direct treatment costs was less clear. A retrospective pharmacoeconomic model suggested that the cost-effectiveness of subcutaneous sumatriptan versus subcutaneous dihydroergotamine depended on which outcome measure was of greatest interest. For measures of rapid relief of migraine, sumatriptan was superior, but the cost of achieving rapid relief was substantial. Sumatriptan improved global quality-of-life scores compared with patients' usual therapy in a randomised crossover trial and appeared to do the same when the drugs were administered in nonblinded, sequential phases in trials which used general and migraine-specific quality-of-life instruments. Thus, sumatriptan is associated with a fast onset of action and improvements in health-related quality of life in patients with migraine. However, the cost of achieving rapid relief of migraine symptoms may be substantial. Compared with patients' usual treatments, sumatriptan appeared to reduce workplace and non-workplace productivity losses. However, few economic data from well controlled prospective comparisons of sumatriptan with other available agents are available to quantify the effect of sumatriptan on the overall cost of migraine.",2,E

Adult patients with moderate to severe migraine initially received customary therapy for migraine episodes for 12 weeks, followed by 24 weeks' treatment with self-administered subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg. Demographic, baseline, health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction rating data were collected during visits to the clinic. Data relating to migraine symptoms, migraine therapy, work productivity and non-work activity time were collected on diary cards filled out by the patients. 749 patients were recruited to the study and 637 received at least 1 dose of sumatriptan. Overall, 75.5% of migraines were successfully treated within 2 hours with sumatriptan compared with 31.9% with customary therapy; 36% of patients reported complete relief at 2 hours with sumatriptan treatment compared with 1% of patients receiving customary therapy. 69% of patients successfully treated 70% of their migraines with sumatriptan within 2 hours, compared with 12% of patients with customary therapy. No serious adverse events were reported; 50% of patients reported an adverse event during the 12-week customary therapy phase and 89% of patients during the 24-week sumatriptan phase. These clinical results, which are consistent with those reported in randomised blinded studies of subcutaneous sumatriptan, suggest that relief of migraine symptoms occurs more often, and in less time, in patients receiving subcutaneous sumatriptan rather than customary therapy as their primary medication.",I,E

A questionnaire was conducted at the end of each study phase, or retrospectively at the end of the study, to assess patient satisfaction with customary therapy and sumatriptan. Sumatriptan was considered by most patients (67 to 85%) to be dependable and fast-acting, and to have a long duration of effect, allowing a quick return to normal activities. By comparison, 15 to 32% of patients considered that their customary therapy possessed the same attributes. However, customary therapy was considered to be easy/very easy to use by 82% of patients compared with 62% for subcutaneous sumatriptan. 89% of patients indicated that they would use sumatriptan again in the future.

Of these, 203 met the inclusion criteria and 164 (81%) completed our telephone survey. The main outcome measures were healthcare costs to the HMO and number of days free of migraine-related disability before and after sumatriptan treatment. Before sumatriptan treatment, 89% of patients reported severe migraine, compared with 63% after sumatriptan treatment. The number of monthly migraine disability days decreased from 6.5 days per month before sumatriptan to 3.9 days per month after sumatriptan. Healthcare utilization rates (ie, number of hospitalizations, emergency department visits) and costs were lower after the patients began taking sumatriptan. The number of different over-the-counter medicines and prescription medications (other than sumatriptan) taken for migraine disabilities decreased. Although total drug expenditures per month increased, the total migraine healthcare expenditure was 41% lower after sumatriptan was initiated. The cost-effectiveness ratio was 47% more favorable after patients started taking sumatriptan. Overall, patients reported fewer migraine-related disabilities, had lower migraine severity scores, and used fewer healthcare resources when taking sumatriptan. These changes resulted in a better cost-effectiveness ratio for migraine treatment.",I,E

The objective of this research was to further investigate the number of dimensions as well as the items contained in each dimension through principal components factor analysis of clinical trial data. Secondary objectives were to determine whether the factor structure changed in post-treatment visits compared with screening visits, to make recommendations for coding the MSQ when the patient did not have a migraine in the previous 4 weeks, and to modify the MSQ if so indicated by this research. Results supported the existence of 3 distinct factors which agreed strongly with the hypothesised dimensions. The analysis of post-treatment data suggested that the underlying factor structure of the MSQ varies as a result of treatment. Based on evaluations of the 'did not have a migraine' response, it was concluded that it be dropped from the MSQ. All these changes have been incorporated into MSQ (Version 2.0) which is being evaluated in studies to determine if its psychometric properties are different than the properties of the previous version.",E,E

Cortical auditory evoked responses were recorded for 500 msec poststimulus. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan and a 17-lead quantitative EEG were assessed at the same timepoints. Relative to placebo, zolmitriptan reduced the maximum absolute amplitude, amplitude difference (from nontarget tone noise) and area under the curve of the cortical auditory target tone event-related potential (P300 ERP). The most dramatic effect of zolmitriptan was to diminish the point estimate of noise during the 200-400 msec poststimulus epoch. The effect of zolmitriptan appeared concentration dependent. The latency of the P300 ERP was unaffected by zolmitriptan and there was no clinically significant effect on the EEG. Modification by zolmitriptan of the cortical electrical activity evoked by auditory stimuli confirms a central action of this drug in humans, which appears to affect cortical information processing without global alteration of the quantitative EEG.",E,E

10235690,Systematic review and guide to selection of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.,Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors,"Edwards, J G; Anderson, I","A meta-analysis of 20 short term comparative studies of 5 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline) has shown no difference in efficacy between individual compounds but a slower onset of action of fluoxetine. There were suggestions that fluoxetine caused more agitation, weight loss and dermatological reactions than the other SSRIs. More patients discontinued fluvoxamine and fewer patients stopped sertraline because of adverse effects than their comparator SSRIs. The most common adverse reactions to the SSRIs were gastrointestinal (especially nausea) and neuropsychiatric (particularly headache and tremor). Data from the Committee on Safety of Medicines showed more reports of suspected reactions (including discontinuation reactions) to paroxetine, and of gastrointestinal reactions to fluvoxamine and paroxetine, than the other SSRIs during their first 2 years of marketing. Prescription-event monitoring revealed a higher incidence of adverse events related to fluvoxamine than its comparators. There were higher incidences of gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, sedation and tremor during treatment with fluvoxamine and of sedation, tremor, sweating, sexual dysfunction and discontinuation reactions with paroxetine. Fluoxetine was not associated with a higher incidence of suicidal, aggressive and related events than the other SSRIs. Patients have survived large overdoses of each of the compounds, but concern has been expressed over 6 fatalities following overdoses of citalopram. Drug interactions mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes are theoretically less likely to occur during treatment with citalopram and sertraline, but there is a sparsity of clinical data to support this. Methodological difficulties and price changes do not allow choice for recommendations on the choice of SSRI based on pharmacoeconomic data. Taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of the methods used to compare drugs, guidelines to the selection of individual SSRIs in clinical practice are proposed. Citalopram should be avoided in patients likely to take overdoses. Fluoxetine may not be the drug of first choice for patients in whom a rapid antidepressant effect is important or for those who are agitated, but it may have advantages over other SSRIs in patients who are poorly compliant with treatment and those who have previously had troublesome discontinuation symptoms. Fluvoxamine, and possibly paroxetine, should not be used as first choice in patients especially prone to SSRI-related adverse reactions, while paroxetine should be avoided if previous discontinuation of treatment was troublesome. When in doubt about the risks of drug interactions, citalopram or sertraline should be considered given the lower theoretical risk of interactions.",3,E

However, given the relatively low spatial resolution of PET, regional indices of neural activity can be influenced by signals from nonneural elements in the intracranial space. We have used PET to study the functional neuroanatomy of headache syndromes, such as cluster headache and experimental headache, by observing activation in brain that is due to synaptic activity. In these studies we noted a bilateral activation in midline structures over several planes that, based on its anatomy, is likely to arise from bilateral large intracranial arteries in the region of the cavernous sinus. We have observed this activity in two different group studies and in 11 of 17 single-subject studies. The most likely explanation for this ""activation"" is the increased volume of space occupied by dilated large vessels containing H215O. We further defined the anatomy of the PET findings using magnetic resonance angiography, which showed bilateral vasodilatation of the internal carotid artery and the basilar artery in nitroglycerin-induced cluster headache attacks. While the fact that vascular structures can contaminate PET-based blood flow studies may be well known to methodological experts, the issue is less well recognized outside the immediate field.",E,E

Changes predictably occur in association with menarche, menstrual cycling, the use of oral contraceptives, pregnancy, and menopause. These predictable headache changes are linked to changing levels of sex hormones. This article describes important relationships between estradiol and neurotransmitters involved in the pathogenesis of headache, such as serotonin. Treatment of headache in women includes the use of acute care and preventive treatments. The effectiveness of both medication and nonmedication treatments is reviewed. Also, unique aspects of treating headache with menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause are described.; This document presents the primary care diagnosis and management of headache in women.  The varying patterns of chronic headache among females during their reproductive years are related to the changing hormonal levels.  Migraine occurs in 25% and tension-type of headache occurs in 88% of women.  These changes occur during menarche, menstrual cycling, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy and menopause as a result of the changes in sex steroid levels.  The physiological relationship between estradiol and other neurotransmitters that causes headache is described.  Diagnosis of headache includes physical and neurologic examinations.  Treatment of headache depends on the woman's reproductive stage.  Acute-care headache treatments include analgesics, opioids, ergotamines, and the triptans for 2-3 days a week.  Chronic or tension-type headaches require preventive therapy, which includes the daily use of antidepressants, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and antiepilepsy medications.  Menstrual migraine medication includes serotonin and prostaglandin active agents during chronic headaches and beta-blockers, antidepressants, calcium channel blockers or valproic acid.  Nonpharmacologic treatment of headache is preferred for pregnant women.",E,E

Although also sometimes used to treat migraine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials, particularly in comparison with the newer drug sumatriptan. Sumatriptan is a specific migraine treatment which has recently become among the most widely prescribed acute migraine therapies. However, while effective, it has low oral bioavailability and some problematic adverse effects. Diclofenac-potassium is a potent NSAID available as a fast-acting oral tablet, which has been shown to be safe and effective in several other acute pain indications. In the clinical trial reported here, the efficacy and safety of diclofenac-potassium in the acute treatment of migraine attacks has been tested in comparison with oral sumatriptan and placebo.; Single oral doses of 50 mg and 100 mg diclofenac-potassium were compared to a single oral dose of 100 mg sumatriptan and placebo in a double-blind randomized crossover trial in 156 adult patients suffering from migraine attacks, with or without aura, selected according to the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria. The primary efficacy criterion was migraine headache pain recorded on a visual analog scale at 2 h after dosing. Secondary endpoints included pain at other time points up to 8 h and the presence of accompanying symptoms (nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia).; Diclofenac-potassium was more effective than placebo in reducing migraine headache pain at 2 h after dosing, which was the primary endpoint. Secondary analyses showed that diclofenac-potassium provided significant pain relief from 60 min after dosing and for all remaining endpoints in the 8-h observation period. Both 50 and 100 mg doses of diclofenac-potassium were similarly effective. A similar effect was shown with sumatriptan; however, significant superiority to placebo was seen only from the 90-min time point. Diclofenac-potassium was generally superior to placebo or sumatriptan in reducing accompanying symptoms, particularly nausea. Diclofenac-potassium seemed to be as well tolerated as placebo, with fewer adverse events reported than after sumatriptan treatment and with more patients assessing the overall tolerability of diclofenac-potassium better than that of sumatriptan.; Compared with placebo and the reference therapy sumatriptan, diclofenac-potassium is an effective, fast-acting, and well-tolerated acute oral therapy for migraine attacks, with advantages over oral sumatriptan in terms of onset of analgesic effect, reduction of accompanying symptoms, and tolerability profile. It may therefore be useful as an alternative oral therapy for migraine attacks.",I,E

Symptoms and ECGs were also monitored.; Sumatriptan 6 mg s.c. altered oesophageal motility in all subjects. This was reflected by a significant increase in the amplitude of oesophageal body contractions (change from pre- to 1 h post-injection: sumatriptan 9.9 (2.8, 17.1) mmHg vs. placebo -0.8 (-4.2, 2.6) mmHg, difference 10.8 (4.4, 17.1) mmHg; P=0.003) and a transient increase in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (change from pre- to 5 min post-injection: sumatriptan 10.9 (5.2, 16.6) mmHg vs. placebo 5.1 (1.8, 8.4) mmHg, difference 5.8 (-0.7, 12.3) mmHg; P=0.08). Sumatriptan had no effect on the velocity of propagation of oesophageal contractions (change from pre- to 1 h post-injection: sumatriptan -0.1 (-0.3, 0.1) cm/s vs. placebo -0.1 (-0.3, 0.0) cm/s, difference 0.1 (-0.1, 0.2) cm/s; P = 0.40). One subject experienced chest symptoms following sumatriptan and, although motility was altered, this did not reach pathological levels. No ECG abnormalities were observed.; Sumatriptan (6 mg s.c.) significantly alters oesophageal motor function without affecting the ECG.

Diclofenac-potassium was developed as an immediate-release tablet with the aim of providing rapid onset of action after oral administration. This formulation has been investigated in the acute treatment of migraine. Data from available placebo-controlled clinical trials indicate that diclofenac-potassium 50 or 100mg as an immediate-release tablet is more effective than placebo and as effective as oral sumatriptan 100mg and ergotamine plus caffeine at reducing pain intensity in patients with migraine 2 hours after initial administration. Duration of pain relief is similar for the 3 drugs but onset appears to be faster with diclofenac-potassium than with oral sumatriptan or ergotamine plus caffeine. Diclofenac-potassium appears to have favourable effects on some accompanying symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. The frequency of these symptoms was significantly lower with diclofenac-potassium than with sumatriptan in 1 study, although only a few patients had vomiting at baseline. Effects on phonophobia or photophobia did not differ between diclofenac-potassium, sumatriptan and ergotamine plus caffeine. The need for rescue medication is consistently less with diclofenac-potassium than with placebo. Data are inconsistent or scarce regarding the effects of diclofenac-potassium versus placebo on other measures such as headache recurrence and working ability. Diclofenac-potassium was generally well tolerated in clinical trials in patients with migraine. Adverse events reported most frequently (abdominal pain, tiredness and fatigue and nausea) were typically mild to moderate.; Diclofenac-potassium provides rapid pain relief (within 60 to 90 minutes), is well tolerated and reduces the frequency of some of the accompanying symptoms in patients with migraine. Available trials indicate that diclofenac-potassium provides similar pain relief to sumatriptan and is at least as effective as ergotamine plus caffeine, but appears to have a greater effect on nausea and vomiting than sumatriptan and a faster onset of action than both drugs. Comparisons with other NSAIDs are lacking. Diclofenac-potassium is likely to find a role as a useful first-line option in the acute treatment of migraine.",E,E

Its primary route of metabolism is via monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A). Antidepressants such as the MAO-A inhibitor moclobemide may be used in patients with chronic headache syndromes. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the interactions between rizatriptan and moclobemide.; In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period cross-over study 12 healthy, young volunteers (six males, six females) were treated with moclobemide (150 mg twice daily) or placebo for 4 days. On the fourth day, a single dose of rizatriptan (10 mg) was administered, and subsequently blood and urine samples were collected for assay of rizatripan and N-monodesmethyl rizatriptan. Plasma concentrates of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), a marker of MAO-A inhibition, were also assessed. Supine and standing blood pressure were measured regularly.; Both treatments were well tolerated. During moclobemide, the increase in supine diastolic blood pressure following rizatriptan administration was augmented. Inhibition of MAO by moclobemide was inferred from a persistent decrease in DHPG level (43% on average). When rizatriptan was coadministered with moclobemide, the area under the plasma drug concentration-time profiles for rizatriptan and its N-monodesmethyl metabolite increased 2.2-fold (90% CI, 1.93-2.47) and 5.3-fold (90% CI, 4.81-5.91), respectively, when compared with placebo.

Some case reports suggest that even the new serotonergic antimigraine drugs such as sumatriptan can lead to overuse and subsequent drug-induced headache. We performed a controlled study to identify the rate of sumatriptan overuse and sumatriptan-induced headache and compared it to the rate of ergotamine overuse and ergotamine-induced headache. Two thousand sixty-five consecutive heachache patients, all experienced in intake of sumatriptan (n = 631) or ergotamine (n = 620), were enrolled over a three-year study period. The rates of overuse and drug-induced headache and the clinical features of the subgroups were compared. Risk factors for sumatriptan overuse were identified. The rates of ergotamine and sumatriptan overuse were 14.2% and 3.5%, respectively (p < 0.001). Drug-induced headache could be found more frequently in cases of ergotamine overuse than in cases of sumatriptan overuse (68% versus 32%; p < 0.01). Development of sumatriptan overuse was most common in patients with previous drug-induced headache (68%), combined headache as the primary headache type (45%), and subcutaneous application of sumatriptan (45%). We conclude that sumatriptan intake can lead to overuse and subsequent drug-induced headache. The risk for overuse and drug-induced headache is significantly lower than in patients with ergotamine intake. This might be caused in part by the relatively short period of sumatriptan availability on the market. The new generation of serotonin-1B/D-receptor agonists in the treatment of headache should have a potential for overuse similar to that of traditional headache drugs.",I,E

Two-hundred-and-seventy-five of them fulfilled the criteria for efficacy analysis, corresponding to 119 patients treated with lysine acetylsalicylate (L-ASA), 114 with sumatriptan and 42 with placebo injections. Both treatments were highly effective compared to placebo (p < 0.0001) in decreasing headache from severe or moderate to mild or none (verbal rating scale, VRS, placebo = 23.8%). Sumatriptan showed a significantly (p = 0.001) better response (91.2%) compared to L-ASA (response 73.9%). Of the patients in the L-ASA-group, 43.7% were pain-free after 2 h; 76.3% after sumatriptan and 14.3% after placebo. It took patients on average 12.6 (L-ASA), 8.2 (sumatriptan), and 19.4 h (placebo) to be able to work again. There was no significant difference between treatment groups in recurrence of headache in responders within 24 h (18.2% L-ASA, 23.1% sumatriptan, 20% placebo). Accompanying symptoms (nausea, vomiting; photophobia, phonophobia, and visual disturbances) improved with both verum treatments to a similar extent. L-ASA was significantly better tolerated than sumatriptan (adverse events L-ASA 7.6%, sumatriptan 37.8%). In conclusion, subcutaneous sumatriptan and lysine acetylsalicylate i.v. are effective treatments for patients suffering from migraine attacks.

A wide variety of agents are available for the symptomatic treatment of migraine headache, including over-the-counter analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), combination products, opiates, ergot alkaloids, corticosteroids, dopamine antagonists, and triptans. In the stepped-care approach, simple analgesics and NSAIDs are the recommended first step for the treatment of mild-to-moderate migraine headaches. Patients who do not respond to first-step treatments may be given ergots, combination products, dopamine antagonists, or triptans as the second step. Corticosteroids or opiates may be used as rescue treatment in patients who do not respond to second-step treatment. A stratified approach to care individualizes treatment based on the severity of the headache and other patient-specific factors. In a stratified approach, dihydroergotamine or triptans may be the first-step treatment for patients who present with a history of severe migraines that have responded poorly to previous treatments. Sumatriptan was the first triptan approved for the symptomatic treatment of migraine headache; newer triptans include zolmitriptan, naratriptan, and rizatriptan. Since sumatriptan is rapidly absorbed by the subcutaneous route, its time to onset of effect is shortest. Among triptan drugs that are administered orally, the relative time to onset may be shorter with rizatriptan than sumatriptan. Naratriptan has a longer time to onset but is associated with a lower rate of migraine recurrence than other triptans. graine headache, ergot alkaloids, triptans,",E,E

Its efficacy and tolerability have been assessed in a number of randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in large numbers of adults with moderate to severe migraine attacks. Oral zolmitriptan 2.5 and 5mg has a rapid onset of action (significant headache relief is observed at 45 minutes) and efficacy is sustained in most patients who respond at 2 hours. The drug is significantly more effective than placebo as measured by a number of parameters including 2-hour headache response rates and pain-free response rates. Other symptoms of migraine, including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia are also alleviated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is effective in the treatment of migraine associated with menses and migraine with aura. There is some evidence to support the use of zolmitriptan in patients with migraine who have had a poor response to previous therapy. The efficacy of zolmitriptan appears to be maintained, with no tachyphylaxis, following repeated administration for multiple attacks of migraine over a prolonged period of time, with high headache response rates reported over all attacks. In comparison with placebo, the incidence of persistent migraine headache is reduced by zolmitriptan and recurrent migraine headache occurs less frequently with the active treatment. Zolmitriptan has also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of persistent and/or recurrent migraine headache. For relief of migraine headache, zolmitriptan 5mg had similar efficacy to sumatriptan 100mg for a single attack, but generally was more effective than sumatriptan 25 and 50mg for multiple attacks, in single trials. The incidence of recurrent headache with zolmitriptan was similar to that with sumatriptan. Zolmitriptan is generally well tolerated with most adverse events being mild to moderate, transient and resolving without intervention or the need for treatment withdrawal. The most common adverse events with zolmitriptan therapy are asthenia, heaviness other than that of the chest or neck, dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, paraesthesia, warm sensation, tightness, vasodilation and chest pain.; Zolmitriptan is effective across a wide range of migraine subtypes, maintains efficacy when used in the long term and is generally well tolerated. Further clinical experience is necessary to define the position of zolmitriptan among other currently or soon to be available selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists. However, on the basis of available data, zolmitriptan should emerge as a useful treatment option in the management of patients with moderate to severe migraine.",E,E

Sumatriptan, a 5-HT1 receptor agonist, blocks this reaction and mediates vasoconstriction of meningeal arteries. However, it is uncertain, whether sumatriptan also has a vasoconstrictive effect on cerebral arteries, which may influence vasoneuronal coupling and induce secondary cerebral blood flow changes. We studied changes of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and the pulsatility index (PI) in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) after stimulus activation before, 10 min and 30 min after subcutaneous application of 6 mg sumatriptan, in order to assess potential vasoactive effects on cerebral circulation. CBFV was recorded from both PCAs simultaneously in 27 migraineurs (twenty women, seven men, mean age 29 years), and arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR) were monitored. Although the mean diastolic blood pressure rose significantly from 75 mm Hg to 81 mm Hg (P<0.05) and systolic blood pressure and respiration rates remained constant, average CBFV values remained constant. Similarly, the relative increase of CBFV by visual stimulation, which is clearly higher compared to controls in other studies (55.0% before, 52.6% after 10 min, and 52.4% after 30 min), and absolute mean values for CBFV and PI did not change after visual stimulation. These results provide evidence against the hypothesis that sumatriptan produces vasoconstriction in the intracranial human arterial circulation as a potential risk of cerebral ischemia.",E,E

The efficacy of oral rizatriptan (5 or 10 mg) has been demonstrated in large (n = 309 to 1746) well designed comparative trials with placebo and oral sumatriptan. Two hours postdose, rizatriptan 5 or 10 mg was more effective than placebo at producing pain relief or a pain free status, relieving migraine-associated symptoms and normalising functional ability. In general, rizatriptan 10 mg appeared to be more effective than rizatriptan 5 mg. However, recurrence rates with rizatriptan 5 and 10 mg appeared to be similar to those with placebo. Patients were significantly more likely to achieve pain relief within 2 hours after receiving rizatriptan 5 mg than sumatriptan 25 mg and after rizatriptan 10 mg than sumatriptan 50 mg. This was also observed with rizatriptan 10 mg compared with sumatriptan 100 mg according to an age-adjusted and a prespecified per-protocol analysis. In general, rizatriptan was better than sumatriptan at relieving migraine-associated symptoms, particularly nausea, and in normalising functional ability depending on which doses were compared. The incidence of headache recurrence, time to onset of recurrence and the need for escape medication in nonresponders appeared to be similar between rizatriptan and sumatriptan. Over the 24 hours after the dose, rizatriptan 10 mg improved the quality of life of patients with migraine compared with placebo. Rizatriptan 10 mg also significantly improved work function compared with placebo and with sumatriptan 50 mg. Rizatriptan appears to be well tolerated with most adverse events being mild and transient. The most commonly experienced events included general digestive complaints, general neurological complaints, dizziness, somnolence, asthenia/fatigue and pain and pressure sensations. In clinical trials, the overall incidence of adverse events with rizatriptan 5 or 10 mg was similar to that with sumatriptan 25 or 50 mg but lower than that with sumatriptan 100 mg. Chest pain was reported by 1 to 3% of rizatriptan recipients and by 3 to 6% of patients receiving sumatriptan (25, 50 or 100 mg); clinically significant effects on ECG parameters, heart rate or blood pressure were not observed with rizatriptan.; Rizatriptan produces pain relief and a pain free status, relieves associated symptoms of migraine, normalises functional ability and improves patient quality of life. Rizatriptan 10 mg appears to be more effective than rizatriptan 5 mg. In comparison with oral sumatriptan, rizatriptan may provide better relief from pain and nausea, with some evidence of a faster onset of action. Thus, rizatriptan 5 or 10 mg is likely to establish a place as an effective and well tolerated agent for the management of acute migraine.",E,E

We aimed to study the effect of sumatriptan on postprandial transient LES relaxations and reflux in healthy subjects.; Esophageal manometry and pH monitoring were performed in 13 healthy volunteers for 30 min before and 90 min after a semiliquid meal (790 kcal). Sumatriptan 6 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) or s.c. placebo were administered on separate days 30 min after the meal.; Sumatriptan significantly increased postprandial LES pressure from 11.0 +/- 1.2 mm Hg to 17.6 +/- 1.2 mm Hg (p < 0.05). However, reflux events were not diminished. In the contrary, reflux was more frequent after sumatriptan than after placebo (3 [1.5-4.5]/30 min vs 2 [0-3]/30 min, p < 0.05). Transient LES relaxations were more frequent after sumatriptan, particularly in the second 30-min period after drug administration (3 [2.5-5]/30 min vs 2 [1.5-2]/30 min, p < 0.05).; Sumatriptan prevents the natural decay in rate of transient LES relaxations that occurs after a meal and favors the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux despite increasing LES pressure. The sustained postprandial high rate of transient LES relaxations after sumatriptan may be a consequence of a prolonged fundus relaxation and retention of meal in the proximal stomach.",2,E

Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be acutely exacerbated by administration of certain serotonin agonists Exacerbation of OCD symptoms by sumatriptan, a 5HT1D agonist (Zohar, 1993), is consistent with pre-clinical data suggesting that the serotonin auto-receptor plays an important role in this disorder (El Mansari et al, 1995). 2. In order to investigate the functional role of the serotonin auto-receptor in OCD, the authors undertook single photon emission computed tomography in OCD patients after administration of sumatriptan and placebo. The authors hypothesized that, as in the case of m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) challenge (Hollander et al, 1995), exacerbation of OCD symptoms would be accompanied by increased cortical metabolism and thus blood flow, and more specifically by increased activity in the orbitofrontal-striatal circuit. They also expected, that as in the case of mCPP challenge (Hollander et al, 1993), exacerbation of OCD symptoms would be associated with a relatively poor response to subsequent treatment with serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors. 3. Sumatriptan (100 mg orally) and placebo were administered on separate days to 14 patients who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for OCD, using a randomized double-blind design. After 90 minutes, patients were injected with Tc-99m HMPAO and underwent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain. Activity in regions of interest was calculated, and compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. Patients were subsequently treated with a serotonin specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). 4. Behavioral response to sumatriptan was heterogenous, with 4 patients showing acute exacerbation, and 4 patients demonstrating a decrease in symptoms. On sumatriptan challenge, there was a significant association between symptom exacerbation and decreased activity in frontal areas. There was an association between decreased activity in an inferior frontal area with worse response to treatment, and also patients with symptom exacerbation after sumatriptan had poorer response to SSRI treatment. 5. Heterogeneity of behavioral response to sumatriptan in OCD is consistent with previous studies demonstrating conflicting and heterogenous behavioral responses to serotonergic challenges (Hollander et al, 1992), and with underlying heterogeneity in the neurobiology of this disorder. 6. It may be hypothesized that increased frontal activity in some patients with OCD is itself a compensatory mechanism. In patients with such compensatory hyperactivity, administration of a serotonin auto-receptor agonist results in decreased frontal activity and exacerbation of OCD symptoms. These patients may also be less likely to respond to treatment with a SSRI. 7. Further work combining pharmacological challenge paradigms and functional imaging techniques in OCD may be helpful in elucidating the neurobiology of this complex disorder.",E,E

Rizatriptan (N = 24) (or placebo, N = 12) was administered as a single 10 mg dose, followed 48 hours later by administration of one 10 mg dose every 2 hours for three doses on 4 consecutive days, corresponding to the maximum daily dose for a migraine attack. The AUC of rizatriptan and its active N-monodesmethyl metabolite after three 10 mg doses was approximately threefold greater than the plasma concentrations following a single 10 mg dose. Metabolite profiles were similar after single and multiple doses. Adverse events during rizatriptan were mild and transient; similar events occurred during placebo, with a somewhat reduced incidence. Diastolic blood pressure tended to increase compared with placebo (approximately 5 mmHg), particularly on the first multiple-dose day (p < .01 vs. placebo). In conclusion, rizatriptan is well tolerated by healthy subjects during multiple-dose administration, with no unexpected accumulation of drug in plasma.",4,E

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers, and calcium channel-blocking antagonists are used in the prophylaxis of migraine. Hence, there is a need to investigate the interaction of these prophylactic drugs with sumatriptan. The interaction of sumatriptan with propranolol, flunarizine, pizotifen, and butorphanol were reported earlier. Naproxen is shown to be effective in prophylactic treatment of migraine. In this study, the authors have investigated the circadian rhythm effect of naproxen on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan at 1000 and 2200 hours. Twelve healthy volunteers were treated with 100 mg sumatriptan succinate either alone or along with 500 mg naproxen orally at either 1000 or 2200 hours in a randomized Latin square design with a washout period of 10 days. Serum samples were collected at predetermined time intervals and analyzed for unchanged sumatriptan by high-performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by using model-independent methods. Naproxen had no statistically significant (p > 0.05) effect on any pharmacokinetic parameters of sumatriptan both at 1000 and 2200 hours treatment. The results of this study suggest that no alteration in the sumatriptan dosage will be necessary for migraine patients taking naproxen prophylactic therapy.",E,E

To sort out this heterogeneity in autism, we investigated whether specific neurobiological markers vary in parallel to core symptomatology. Specifically, we assessed growth hormone response to the 5-HT 1d agonist, sumatriptan, and linked this measure of serotonergic function to the severity of repetitive behaviors in adult autistic patients. Eleven adult patients with autism or Asperger's disorder were randomized to single dose sumatriptan (6 mg SQ) and placebo challenges, separated by a one-week interval. In adult autistic disorders, severity of repetitive behaviors at baseline, as measured by YBOCS-compulsion score, significantly positively correlated with both peak delta growth hormone response and area under the curve growth hormone response to sumatriptan. Thus, the severity of a specific behavioral dimension in autism (repetitive behaviors) parallels the sensitivity of the 5-HT 1d receptor, as manifest by sumatriptan elicited GH response.",4,E

The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of sumatriptan on transpyloric flow and gastric accommodation during and immediately after ingestion of a liquid meal using duplex sonography. Ten healthy subjects were investigated twice on separate days. In random order either sumatriptan 6 mg (Imigran 0.5 mL) or a placebo were given s.c. 15 min before ingesting 500 mL of a meat soup. The subjects were examined during the 3-min period before ingestion of the liquid meal, the 3-min spent drinking the meal and 10 min postprandially. Sumatriptan caused a significant widening of both the gastric antrum (P=0.02) and the proximal stomach (P=0.01) 10 min postprandially as compared with placebo. It caused no significant differences in time to initial gastric emptying (P=0.2), but significantly delayed commencement of peristaltic-related transpyloric flow (P=0.04). Sumatriptan had no significant effect on mean abdominal symptom scores, but after sumatriptan there was a significant negative correlation between width of postprandial antral area and postprandial nausea and between width of postprandial antral area and postprandial bloating. We therefore conclude that sumatriptan causes a postprandial dilatation of both the distal and the proximal stomach with no change in dyspeptic symptoms nor in length of time to first gastric emptying. Time to commencement of peristaltic-related emptying is delayed.",4,E

The current mainstay of surgical intervention for these patients is percutaneous radiofrequency retrogasserian rhizotomy (PRFR). However, when performed for V1 distribution pathology, PRFR can lead to corneal anesthesia, which places the patient at risk for future visual loss. It also increases the risk of facial dysesthesia.; In a prospective, consecutive series, 18 patients with intractable CH were followed for a mean of 5.2 years (range, 40-78 mo) after they had undergone PRGR, performed using a standard technique. The significance of this technique as an alternative to PRFR is that it should result in a lower rate of both corneal and facial anesthesia and provide an acceptable degree of pain relief.; Fifteen patients (83%) obtained immediate pain relief after one or two injections; the majority of them experienced relief after the first injection. CH recurred in seven patients (39%) over the course of the study. Two of these patients received a second injection, and both met with equal success. Two other patients underwent PRFR. Excluding those who underwent PRFR, the overall daily headache frequency decreased from 3.5 +/- 0.3 attacks per day preoperatively to 0.6 +/- 0.2 attacks per day at last follow-up. The severity of these headaches, as assessed by verbal pain scales, also decreased from 10 preoperatively to 4.4 +/- 1.4 at follow-up. None of the patients, including those who required a second procedure, experienced corneal anesthesia or facial dysesthesia.; This study provides the first long-term evaluation of PRGR for the treatment of medically refractive chronic CH and lends support to both the safety and long-term efficacy of this procedure. Further investigations are needed to compare directly the relative efficacy and safety of PRGR and PRFR.",3,E

Differences between zolmitriptan, 5 mg, and sumatriptan, 25 mg, were statistically significant at 1, 2, and 4 hours (odds ratio=1.43, 1. 46, and 1.78, respectively; all P<.001) and at 1 and 4 hours versus sumatriptan, 50 mg (odds ratio=1.28, P=.002; odds ratio=1.29, P=.012, respectively). Although not statistically significant at 2 hours, more patients responded to zolmitriptan, 5 mg, than to sumatriptan, 50 mg (odds ratio=1.16, P=.064). Patients receiving zolmitriptan, 2. 5 mg or 5 mg, achieved more pain relief over 24 hours than patients receiving sumatriptan, 25 mg (odds ratio=1.47, and 1.54 respectively, both P<.001) or sumatriptan, 50 mg (odds ratio=1.17, P=.021; odds ratio=1.22, P=.005, respectively).

The headache relief rates were combined from the placebo arms of these randomised clinical trials assessing the value of sumatriptan in acute treatment of migraine. The main outcome measure was the proportion of patients reclassified from severe or moderate headache severity to no or mild headache severity 2 h after the beginning of treatment. In the oral regimen 222 of 865 patients (25.7%) reported no or mild headache severity after 2 h, compared to 279 of 862 patients (32.4%) of those receiving subcutaneous placebo (6.7% difference; 95% CI 2.4-11.0%). Adjusting for treatment setting and severity of headache at baseline did not change the observed difference. After placebo treatment at home 285 of 1,054 patients (27.0%) reported no or mild headache severity after 2 h, compared to 216 of 673 patients (32.1%) among those receiving placebo in hospital (5.1 % difference; 95% CI 0.6-9.5%). When adjusted for route of administration and severity of headache at baseline, the difference in relief rates between home and hospital setting disappeared. These findings indicate that subcutaneous administration enhances the placebo effect of acute treatment of migraine. Future trials of antimigraine drugs assessing the relative efficacy of various routes of administration should use a double-dummy technique. The interpreting of placebo-controlled trial results must therefore consider that the effect in the drug arm of the trial depends in part on the route of administration.",I,E

Adult patients received placebo and zolmitriptan 5 mg and 10 mg orally for the acute treatment of episodic or chronic cluster headache. Headache intensity was rated by a five-point scale: none, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe. Patients only treated moderate to very severe headaches. The primary efficacy measure was headache response (two-point or greater reduction from baseline in the cluster headache rating scale) at 30 minutes. Secondary efficacy measures included proportion of patients with initial headache relief within 15 and 30 minutes, mild or no pain at 30 minutes, meaningful headache relief, and use of escape medication.; A total of 124 patients took at least one dose of study medication, with 73% having episodic and 27% chronic cluster headache. For the primary endpoint, there was a treatment-by-cluster-headache-type interaction (p = 0.0453). Therefore, results are presented separately for chronic and episodic cluster headache. In patients with episodic cluster headache, the difference between zolmitriptan 10 mg and placebo at 30 minutes reached significance (47% versus 29%; p = 0.02). Mild or no pain at 30 minutes was reported by 60%, 57%, and 42% patients treated with zolmitriptan 10 mg, zolmitriptan 5 mg, and placebo (both p </= 0.01 versus placebo).

Sumatriptan is a selective 5-HT(1B/D) receptor agonist which does not cross the blood-brain barrier. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of sumatriptan on exercise capacity. Ten healthy male subjects (mean age 28.4+/-10.8 years) performed a maximal treadmill exercise test according to the Bruce protocol with expired gas analysis on two occasions. Either 6 mg of sumatriptan or placebo was administered subcutaneously in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Exercise time was greater after placebo compared with sumatriptan [914 and 879 s respectively; 95% confidence interval (CI) of difference 12.1 s, 59.1 s; P = 0.008]. There was no significant effect on peak oxygen consumption (placebo, 50.6+/-6.3 ml.min(-1).kg(-1); sumatriptan, 51.7+/-7.6 ml.min(-1).kg(-1)). Sumatriptan administration resulted in decreases in both heart rate (sumatriptan, 188+/-14 beats/min, placebo, 196+/-12 beats/min; 95% CI of difference 12.6, 2.6; P = 0.008) and respiratory exchange ratio (sumatriptan, 1.23+/-0.06; placebo, 1.26+/-0.07; 95% CI of difference 0.05, 0.01; P = 0.01) at peak exercise. There were no significant differences in blood pressure, heart rate or submaximal oxygen consumption between sumatriptan and placebo treatments at any stage of exercise. Thus sumatriptan reduces maximal exercise capacity in normal males. The failure to demonstrate any haemodynamic or cardiorespiratory effect suggests that sumatriptan enhances perception of fatigue by a peripheral mechanism affecting 5-HT modulation.",4,E

The all-treated analysis included 1058 patients who took study medication. The primary endpoint, complete headache response, was reported by 39%, 38% and 32% of patients treated with zolmitriptan, sumatriptan and placebo, respectively, with no significant difference between treatment groups. In patients with moderate headache at baseline, complete response was significantly greater following zolmitriptan than after placebo (48% vs. 27%; P=0.01); there was no significant difference between sumatriptan and placebo groups (40% vs. 27%). In patients with severe baseline headache (where a greater reduction in headache intensity is required for a headache response), there was no significant difference between any groups in complete headache response rates. For secondary endpoints, active treatment groups were significantly superior to placebo for: 1-, 2- and 4-h headache response (e.g. 2-h headache response rates: zolmitriptan 59%; sumatriptan 61%; placebo 44%; P < 0.01 vs. placebo); pain-free response rates at 2 and 4 h; alleviation of nausea and vomiting; use of escape medication and restoration of normal activity. The incidence of adverse events was similar between zolmitriptan and sumatriptan groups but was slightly lower in the placebo group. The lack of difference between active treatments and placebo for complete response probably reflects the high placebo response obtained, which is probably a result of deficiencies in trial design. For example, the randomization ratio may result in high expectation of active treatment. Thus, while ethically patient exposure to placebo should be minimized, this must be balanced against the scientific rationale underpinning study design.",I,I

We studied ATP flux from anaerobic glycolysis (An Gly), the creatine kinase reaction (CK) and oxidative phosphorylation (Ox Phos) using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) kinetic data collected during exercise. It was found that side-effects induced acutely by injection of 6 mg sumatriptan succinate s.c. were associated with reduced oxygen storage in peripheral skeletal muscle 5-20 min after injection as demonstrated by a transient reduction in mitochondrial function at end-exercise. These results suggest that mild vasoconstriction in peripheral skeletal muscle is associated with the action of sumatriptan and is likely to be the source of the side-effects experienced by some users.

Migraine can be used as a template to understand the activation of nociceptive systems in the head and thus their neurotransmitter mediation and modulation. In recent years, the role of serotonin (5-HT) in headache pharmacology has been unravelled in the context of both understanding its role in the nociceptive systems related to headache and by exploiting its 5-HT1 receptor subtypes in headache therapeutics.

The authors have demonstrated previously that ergotamine can lead to a significant reduction of hyperemic myocardial blood flow, but little is known about the effect of the newer serotonin analogues. Coronary artery constriction caused by serotonin or its analogues is mediated mainly by 5HT2 receptors. The selective 5HT1B/1D agonist naratriptan has no significant activity at 5HT2 receptors; however, like all 5HT1B/1D agonists developed for the acute treatment of migraine, naratriptan could potentially constrict coronary arteries by activation of 5HT1B receptors.; The effects on myocardial blood flow of subcutaneous naratriptan 1.5 mg compared with placebo were assessed under resting and hyperemic conditions with PET using oxygen-15 labeled water during two separate visits. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 34 migraine subjects with no evidence of ischemic heart disease, studied outside a migraine attack.; Naratriptan did not differ significantly from placebo in its effects on resting myocardial blood flow, but did evoke a small, significant fall in hyperemic myocardial blood flow (-13% versus placebo) and an increase in hyperemic coronary resistance (+19% versus placebo) without any signs or symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia. Naratriptan did not significantly affect the coronary vasodilator reserve (hyperemic/resting blood flow) compared with placebo.; These results show that at therapeutic doses, naratriptan exerts only a minor effect on myocardial blood flow, coronary vasodilator reserve, or coronary resistance among subjects with no evidence of ischemic heart disease.

The concomitant use of a NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) has been recommended to decrease the recurrence rate. Sixty seven patients that treated successfully 8 migraine attacks with 100 mg of sumatritpan PO and presented recurrence in at least 5 attacks were studied prospectively. The patients received 100 mg of sumatriptan and 550 mg of naproxen sodium PO to treat 4 consecutive moderate or severe migraine attacks. The recurrence rate, once at least 62.5% (5 out of 8 attacks), decreased to 14.2% (38 out of 268 attacks) with the combination of compounds (p<0.0001). We then studied two groups of 13 patients made randomicaly from the 67 initially evaluated, that were given sumatriptan 100 mg plus naproxen sodium 550 mg or placebo, in a double-blind design, to treat 3 other consecutive migraine attacks. Each group of patients treated 39 attacks. The recurrence among the patients taking sumatriptan plus placebo was 59% (23 out of 39 attacks) and the recurrence presented by the group taking sumatriptan plus naproxen was 25.5% (10 out of 39 attacks) (p<0.0003).

Naratriptan is a more potent and more lipophilic member of this class of agent and could prove beneficial in such patients. This is the first well-controlled study to assess the value of another 5-HT1B/1D agonist in this difficult patient subset.; This study comprised two migraine attacks. The first (attack 1) was a single-blind assessment of the efficacy of sumatriptan (50 mg orally) in patients with a history of poor response to the drug. The second (attack 2) was a randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of naratriptan (2.5 mg orally) in nonresponders to oral sumatriptan.; Attack 1: About two thirds of this selected migraine population did not respond to sumatriptan. Attack 2: Naratriptan was statistically superior to placebo for headache relief at 2 hours and 4 hours, as well as for most other features of migraine attacks. These data suggest an intrinsic efficacy of naratriptan in this patient subset and not a coincidental response.

The overall rank order of the frequency of adverse events was as follows: naratriptan < sumatriptan = rizatriptan < zolmitriptan. With the exception of eletriptan, 5-HT1B/1D agonists exhibit correlations between absolute dose, Cmax (R = 0.97), and LogD (R = 0. 71). For neurological and dizziness/somnolence/drowsiness adverse event frequencies, the overall rank order was sumatriptan < naratriptan < rizatriptan < zolmitriptan. Neither LogD nor absolute dose size predicted adverse event frequencies.; Triptans may be distinguished in terms of their tolerability. Effectiveness, absolute dose size, and lipophilicity are related for the 5-HT1B/1D agonists considered here, except eletriptan. Adverse event frequencies cannot be predicted from in vitro measures of lipophilicity, in vivo estimates of absolute bioavailability, dose size, or any combination of these variables. Since these drugs are all agonists at 5-HT1B/1D receptors in the low nanomolar range, but differ in their tolerability profiles, adverse effects are not likely to be mediated through 5-HT1B/1D receptors.

Previous uncontrolled studies have reported that the local use of anaesthetic agents in the area of the sphenopalatine fossa is able to extinguish nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced pain in CH. The present study, carried out according to a double-blind placebo-controlled design, included 15 CH patients, six with episodic CH (mean +/- SD age of 36.8+/-5.6 years), and nine with chronic CH (37.8+/-10.4 years). Patients had undergone a standard NTG test (0.9 mg sublingually), during which the intensity of pain was scored using a visuoanalogic scale (VAS, range 0-10). Nine patients (two with the episodic form, seven with the chronic form) experienced a typical, spontaneous-like attack on the usual side, occurring in all cases within 45 min. In these patients, the test was repeated with an interval of 2 days, and once pain intensity reached 5 on the VAS, a 10% solution of cocaine hydrochloride (1 ml, mean amount per application 40-50 mg), or 10% lidocaine (1 ml), or saline was applied using a cotton swab in the area corresponding to the sphenopalatine fossa, under anterior rhinoscopy. This was done in both the symptomatic and the non-symptomatic side, for 5 min. Treatments were always performed randomly, in separate sessions. All patients responded promptly to both anaesthetic agents, with complete cessation of induced pain occurring after 31.3+/-13.1 min for cocaine and 37.0+/-7.8 min for lidocaine (M+/-SD). In the case of saline application, pain severity increased thereafter, and extinction of the provoked attacks occurred with a latency of 59.3+/-12.3 min (P<0.01 and P<0.01 vs. cocaine and lidocaine, respectively, Mann-Whitney U-test). While further suggesting that the sphenopalatine ganglion participates in the mechanisms of pain, these findings indicate that the local administration of the anaesthetic agents cocaine and lidocaine is effective on NTG-induced CH attacks, and may be used in the symptomatic treatment of this disorder.",3,E

Rizatriptan tended to provide freedom from pain sooner than zolmitriptan (hazard ratio 1.26, P = 0.075), acting within 60 min following dosing. More patients were pain free at 2 h on rizatriptan than on zolmitriptan (43.2% vs. 35.6%, P=0.041), while headache relief at 2 h was similar (70.5% vs. 66.8%).

Four hundred and seventeen (417) migraine patients treated 15,301 migraine attacks over the course of the study.; The results show that 84% of attacks treated with a single 2.5 mg dose of naratriptan were not associated with the occurrence of an adverse event. The percentage of attacks associated with an adverse event did not increase with number of doses used to treat a given attack (1 vs. 2) or duration of use (0-6 months vs. > 6-12 months). The only adverse events experienced in > 2% of attacks throughout the 1-year study were nausea (3% of attacks), hyposalivation (2% of attacks), and drowsiness/sleepiness (2% of attacks). Headache relief 4 h post-dose was reported in a median 70% of moderate or severe attacks and a median 86% of mild attacks treated with naratriptan tablets 2.5 mg. The percentages of patients reporting headache relief did not diminish as a function of increased duration of treatment (0-6 months vs. > 6-12 months) or frequency of use (for > 36 vs. < 36 attacks). The mean number of tablets taken per attack was 1.2. A second naratriptan 2.5 mg tablet was taken for headache recurrence in a mean 16% (median 8%) of attacks.; The results of this study demonstrate that naratriptan tablets 2.5 mg taken for acute migraine attacks over a 1-year period are well-tolerated and effective.",I,E

The results of these studies and the findings of autoradiography and neuroimaging studies, pointed to a possible role of the 5-HT1B/1D receptor in the pathophysiology of OCD. Recently the selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist sumatriptan was used to further explore the role of the 5-HT1B/1D receptor in OCD. Equivocal results with respect to the increase of obsessive compulsive symptoms in patients with OCD were reported. In one study a significant increase in plasma growth hormone (GH) concentration was observed, although sumatriptan does not pass the blood-brain barrier.; In order to further explore the role of the 5-HT1B/1D receptor in the pathophysiology of OCD, we performed this study, following the same design as Ho Pian et al.

All reported a high daily frequency of attacks (more than 3 per day) and the related overuse of s.c. sumatriptan. The results show that the overall incidence of adverse events among patients receiving sumatriptan injections for the treatment of cluster headache is low. The extended administration of this drug in episodic cluster headache did not result in tolerance problems or tachyphylaxis. Only 4 patients experienced minor adverse events and recovered more slowly than the others. They suffered from migraine without aura and cluster headache, and showed a family history of migraine.

The aim of the study was to examine the validity of the MIDAS score, and the five items comprising the score, compared to data from a 90 day daily diary used, in part, to record acute disability from headache. In a population-based sample, 144 clinically diagnosed migraine headache sufferers were enrolled in a 90 day diary study and completed the MIDAS questionnaire at the end of the study. The daily diary was used to record detailed information on headache features as well as activity limitations in work, household chores, and non-work activities (social, family and leisure activities). The MIDAS score was the sum of missed work or school days, missed household chores days, missed non-work activity days, and days at work or school plus days of household chores where productivity was reduced by half or more in the last 3 months. Validity was assessed by comparing MIDAS items and the MIDAS score with equivalent measures derived from the diary. The MIDAS items for missed days of work or school (mean 0.96, median 0) and for missed days of household work (mean 3.64, median 2.0) were similar to the corresponding diary-based estimates of missed work or school (mean 1.23, median 0) and of missed household work (mean 3.93, median 2.01). Values for missed days of non-work activities (MIDAS mean 2.6 and median 1 versus diary mean 2.22 and median 0.95) were also similar. Responses to MIDAS questions about number of days where productivity was reduced by half or more in work (mean 3.77, median 2.00) and in household work (mean 3.92, median 2.00) significantly overestimated the corresponding diary-based measures for work (mean 2.94, median 1.06) and household work (mean 2.22, median 0.98). Nonetheless, the overall MIDAS score (mean 14.53, median 9.0) was not significantly different form the reference diary-based measure (mean 13.5, median 8.4). The correlation between the MIDAS summary score and an equivalent diary score was 0.63.

Patients treated up to 10 headaches with sumatriptan, 50 mg, or placebo (4:1). Headache features, recorded prior to treatment, were used to classify each headache using IHS criteria. Headache response (moderate or severe pain reduced to mild or no pain) and pain-free response were recorded at 2 and 4 hours postdose (primary endpoint). Because patients treated multiple attacks, statistical methods controlling for within-subject correlation were used.; Two hundred forty-nine migraineurs treated 1576 moderate or severe headaches: migraine (n = 1110), migrainous (n = 103), and tension-type (n = 363). Sumatriptan was superior to placebo for headache response 4 hours postdose (primary endpoint) across all headache types (migraine, 66% versus 48%; P<.001; migrainous, 71% versus 39%; P<.01; tension-type, 78% versus 50%, P<.001). Sumatriptan was also superior to placebo for pain-free response 4 hours postdose for migraine (41% versus 24%, P<.001) and tension-type headaches (56% versus 36%, P =.001). Sumatriptan provided superior pain-free response 2 hours postdose for migraine (18% versus 7%, P<.0001) and tension-type headache (28% versus 14%, P =.0005) compared with placebo.; Sumatriptan, 50-mg tablets, are effective for the full spectrum of headaches experienced by patients with disabling migraine due to a sumatriptan-responsive mechanism.",I,E

Pain-free response 2 and 4 hours postdose, headache recurrence, and safety were examined. Significance tests were performed only for the first-treated attacks.; Twenty-six patients with disabling headache treated 46 mild and 166 moderate or severe headaches. For the first-treated headaches while pain was mild, pain-free rates were significantly higher for sumatriptan than placebo 4 hours postdose (78% versus 0%, P =.02), but not 2 hours postdose (52% versus 0%, P =.22). Across all headaches treated while pain was mild, pain-free responses were higher for sumatriptan than placebo 4 hours (85% versus 17%) and 2 hours (50% versus 0%) postdose compared with placebo. When the same patients treated headaches while pain was moderate or severe, pain-free rates were lower than that reported for treatment during mild pain. There was a trend toward lower headache recurrence in headaches treated while pain was mild compared with moderate or severe pain (13% versus 18%). No drug-related adverse events were reported in the headaches treated while pain was mild.; Patients with disabling migraine may benefit from early intervention with sumatriptan, 50 mg, while pain is mild.",I,E

11145638,New avenues in treatment of paediatric migraine: a review of the literature.,Adolescent; Analgesics; Anticonvulsants; Child; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Pediatrics; Serotonin Receptor Agonists,"Pakalnis, A","Headaches are a common problem in paediatric practice. Recurrent headaches can be a significant source of stress for patient and parents, and disruptive regarding school obligations and parental work responsibilities. Most treatment interventions are developed from research data extrapolated from adult studies, with resultant concerns of safety and efficacy when utilizing these therapeutic conclusions in children.; This paper incorporates current treatment strategies in paediatric migraine utilizing a Medline search of English language studies from January 1988 to December 1999, with a literature search referencing the terms of paediatrics, migraines, headaches, therapy and treatment. Reference sections of the articles were reviewed for pertinent information prior to January 1988. Articles were evaluated systematically to formulate concise terms for diagnosis of paediatric migraine and applicability to clinical treatment studies. Particular emphasis was placed on newer options with relevance in adult treatment such as triptans and anti-epileptic drugs, and their benefit in therapy of paediatric migraine. Non-pharmacological options were also subjected to organized review to determine relevance in treatment of paediatric migraine.; The review of the literature indicates that although migraine in childhood and adolescence appears to be increasing in prevalence, few clinical studies are available, with most current treatment recommendations utilizing data from adult studies.; Further headache treatment studies in the paediatric population are necessary in order to ascertain safety and efficacy of pharmaco-therapeutics in these children. Also, much current interest in treatment in adults with recurrent headaches involves non-pharmacological areas-dietary modification and stress management. Application of these avenues especially warrants further clarification with regard to relevance in paediatric migraine treatment.",I,E

The first of the class, sumatriptan, and the newer triptans (zolmitriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan, almotriptan and frovatriptan) display high agonist activity at mainly the serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor subtypes. As expected for a class of compounds developed for affinity at a specific receptor, there are minor pharmacodynamic differences between the triptans. Sumatriptan has a low oral bioavailability (14%) and all the newer triptans have an improved oral bioavailability and for one, risatriptan, the rate of absorption is faster. The half-lives of naratriptan, eletriptan and, in particular, frovatriptan (26 to 30h) are longer than that of sumatriptan (2h). These pharmacokinetic improvements of the newer triptans so far seem to have only resulted in minor differences in their efficacy in migraine. Double-blind, randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the different triptans and triptans with other medication should ideally be the basis for judging their place in migraine therapy. In only 15 of the 83 reported RCTs were 2 triptans compared, and in 11 trials triptans were compared with other drugs. Therefore, in all placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials, the relative efficacy of the triptans was also judged by calculating the therapeutic gain (i.e. percentage response for active minus percentage response for placebo). The mean therapeutic gain with subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg (51%) was more than that for all other dosage forms of triptans (oral sumatriptan 100mg 32%; oral sumatriptan 50mg 29%: intranasal sumatriptan 20mg 30%; rectal sumatriptan 25mg 31%; oral zolmitriptan 2.5mg 32%; oral rizatriptan 10mg 37%; oral eletriptan 40mg 37%; oral almotriptan 12.5mg 26%). Compared with oral sumatriptan 100mg (32%), the mean therapeutic gain was higher with oral eletriptan 80mg (42%) but lower with oral naratriptan 2.5mg (22%) or oral frovatriptan 2.5mg (16%). The few direct comparative randomised clinical trials with oral triptans reveal the same picture. Recurrence of headache within 24 hours after an initial successful response occurs in 30 to 40% of sumatriptan-treated patients. Apart from naratriptan, which has a tendency towards less recurrence, there appears to be no consistent difference in recurrence rates between the newer triptans and sumatriptan. Rizatriptan with its shorter time to maximum concentration (tmax) tended to produce a quicker onset of headache relief than sumatriptan and zolmitriptan. The place of triptans compared with non-triptan drugs in migraine therapy remains to be established and further RCTs are required.",E,E

In clinical trials alone, more than 88000 migraine patients had treated more than 300000 migraine attacks with sumatriptan, and 2000 normal healthy volunteers had been exposed to the drug. This paper describes the safety and tolerability profile of sumatriptan in three sections: adverse events reported in clinical trials, special issues, and spontaneous post-marketing reports of adverse reactions. Data from the extensive clinical trials programme coupled with information from nearly 10 years of experience in clinical practice demonstrate that sumatriptan is generally well-tolerated, with an acceptable benefit-risk ratio when used properly. Significant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events are rare but have been observed. This fact highlights the need for careful patient selection and vigilant adherence to the prescribing recommendations for sumatriptan. The wealth of clinical trials and post-marketing information for sumatriptan may be useful in guiding prescribing decisions for members of this class of drugs.",I,E

In the year (April 1997 to March 1998) following the launch of the TELs, depression PCRs were significantly higher among patients using these compounds compared with sumatriptan-treated patients (5.1%, CI 1.8-12.0%, P < 0.05). However, after taking account of prior depression (odds ratio (OR) 6.45, 95% CI 3.63-11.43), TELs were not significantly associated with depression (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03-2.13). Furthermore, rates of newly diagnosed depression after treatment were similar in the two triptan groups (sumatriptan 4.2%; TELs 3.9%). Although, the TELs are being prescribed to patients with higher pre-existing rates of depression, they are not associated with subsequently increased consulting for depressive illness compared with patients taking sumatriptan. This study highlights the potential to use GPRD to test targeted hypotheses exploring pharmacovigilance issues for patients using new medicines.",E,E

Almotriptan, a new selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist, may be better tolerated over the long term.; This 1-year study was conducted on 806 adults between the ages of 18 and 65 years suffering from migraine, either with or without aura. The patients met the criteria for study as outlined by the International Headache Society and were instructed on drug use. Oral almotriptan 12.5 mg was used to treat the attack of any pain severity and a second dose was permitted in case of relapse of pain during the first 24 hours. Rescue medication was provided. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed by a combination of patient reporting and clinical visit evaluations.; Overall, almotriptan was well tolerated. At 2 hours, 81% of attacks were relieved; 56% of the subjects were entirely free of pain. These efficacy data are similar for the first as well as the last attack studied. At analysis, 534 patients had treated their migraines for at least 6 months. About half of all patients experienced at least one adverse event, with 87% of the events being mild or moderate in nature. The most frequent adverse events were back pain (7.23% of patients), bronchitis (5.76%), and influenzalike symptoms (5.62%). Seventy-one percent of the adverse events were not related to almotriptan use.; Almotriptan at an oral dose of 12.5 mg is safe antimigraine treatment. The safety profile results are similar to those obtained in other controlled triptan clinical studies. Almotriptan is efficacious in moderate-to-severe migraine pain and can be used repeatedly in recurrent episodes. The long-term safety data will be reanalyzed when full data become available.",I,E

Adolescents (aged 12-17 years) with a > or =6-month history of migraine with or without aura, 2 to 8 moderate or severe migraines per month, and a typical migraine duration of > or =4 hours were eligible for participation. After initial treatment with sumatriptan 10 mg, the dose could be adjusted down to 5 mg or up to 20 mg at the investigator's discretion to optimize tolerability or efficacy. Patients could treat an unlimited number of moderate or severe migraine attacks, provided there was a 24-hour headache-free period between treated attacks and a 2-hour period between doses of sumatriptan NS. A second dose of sumatriptan NS was available for headache recurrence 2 to 24 hours after initial treatment; no more than 2 doses could be used within a 24-hour period. Adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiographic and physical findings, and laboratory variables were assessed. Headache response (reduction of moderate/severe predose pain to mild/no pain) and pain-free response (reduction of moderate/severe predose pain to no pain) were reported by patients 2 hours after dosing.; A total of 437 patients treated > or =1 migraine; 3272 total attacks were treated, with 3675 drug exposures (mean, 1.1 dose/attack). Patients had a mean age of 14.1 years, 91% were white, and 53% were female. Seven patients used the 5-mg dose; meaningful conclusions concerning this dose could not be made. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 33% of attacks with the 10-mg dose and 31% with the 20-mg dose; most were related to taste disturbance. Adverse events did not increase with a second dose or over time. Four percent (16/437) of patients withdrew due to drug-related adverse events. One serious adverse event, a facial-nerve ischemic event (10-mg dose), was considered drug related. No drug-related changes in vital signs or electrocardiographic findings were observed.

Pain-free response 2 hours after dosing was reported by 43% and 40% of patients in the 10- and 20-mg groups, respectively.; Based on these results, sumatriptan NS at doses of 10 and 20 mg was well tolerated and effective in the 1-year treatment of multiple migraine attacks in adolescents.",I,E
11200789,Rational migraine management: optimising treatment with the triptans.,Humans; Migraine Disorders; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Serotonin Receptor Agonists; Sumatriptan,"Millson, D S","In the last two years, a number of 5-HT1B/1D agonist triptans with enhanced lipophilicity (TELs) relative to the first drug of this class, sumatriptan, have been approved for marketing in most countries of the world (naratriptan, rizatriptan and zolmitriptan). In addition, at least three others are in advanced stage of clinical development (almotriptan, eletriptan, and frovatriptan). This paper sets out to review the recent data with the aim of identifying: 1) What are the critical differences between the TELs and sumatriptan? 2) How do the currently licensed TELs compare? 3) Is it possible to provide a rational approach to migraine therapy based on objective differences in the clinical profile of these new drugs? Recent randomised controlled and comparator data were reviewed, including the independent FDA assessment of rizatriptan. Critical differences for the new TELs (naratriptan, rizatriptan and zolmitriptan) which may lead to more rational migraine management: Both rizatriptan (10 mg) and zolmitriptan (2.5 mg and 5.0 mg) have demonstrated superior efficacy to sumatriptan 100 mg, and 25 and 50 mg respectively. Therefore, for first line use either rizatriptan or zolmitriptan would be appropriate for moderate and severe headache. Rizatriptan has a more rapid onset of action than sumatriptan 100 mg. Both rizatriptan and zolmitriptan have a more rapid onset of action than naratriptan. Therefore, for a rapid onset of action either rizatriptan or zolmitriptan would be appropriate. Naratriptan would appear to have a lower recurrent headache rate than sumatriptan, rizatriptan or zolmitriptan. However, 24-hour efficacy rates for zolmitriptan 2.5 mg were significantly greater than for sumatriptan 25 mg and 50 mg and were not significantly different from naratriptan. Therefore, for headaches of long duration and with a tendency to recur (e.g. menstrual headaches) either naratriptan or zolmitriptan would be appropriate. Naratriptan has lower reported adverse event rates comparable with placebo. This would support the use of naratriptan 2.5 mg in patients who have demonstrated poor tolerance to the ""triptan type"" adverse events.",E,E

11200800,Pharmacology of emesis and gastrointestinal motility: implications for migraine.,Animals; Gastrointestinal Motility; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Vomiting,"De Ponti, F","This paper outlines the physiopharmacology of emesis and its gastrointestinal motor correlates in relation to the possible treatment strategies of a migraine attack. The gastrointestinal motor correlates of vomiting consist of a stereotyped motor response to diverse stimuli and basically include gastric relaxation and a series of events (intestinal motor inhibition and disruption of slow wave activity) in preparation for the occurrence of a retrograde giant contraction that propagates orally and empties intestinal contents into the stomach. These motor correlates always accompany vomiting, but may also appear as an independent phenomenon. Antidopaminergic agents, such as metoclopramide and domperidone, have antiemetic/prokinetic properties, block the gastrointestinal motor correlates of vomiting and may speed up absorption of antimigraine agents. The use of 5-HT4 receptor agonists may be an alternative strategy to achieve prokinesia during a migraine attack, although this issue still needs to be fully addressed by controlled studies. Sumatriptan was found to induce gastric relaxation and delay gastric emptying, but the impact of these effects during a migraine attack remains to be determined.",E,E

Plasma and urinary almotriptan concentrations were measured by HPLC methods. Treatment effects on pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed by analysis of variance. Mean almotriptan Cmax was significantly higher following combination treatment with fluoxetine (52.5 +/- 11.9 ng/ml vs. 44.3 +/- 10.9 ng/ml, p = 0.023). Mean AUC0-infinity was not significantly affected by fluoxetine coadministration (353 +/- 55.7 ng.h/ml vs. 333 +/- 33.6 ng.h/ml, p = 0.059). Confidence interval analysis (90%) of log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters showed that the confidence interval for AUC0-infinity was within the 80% to 125% limit for equivalence, but Cmax was not (90% CI 106%-134% of the reference mean). Adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity, and no clinically significant treatment effects on vital signs or ECGs were observed.

Treatment satisfaction differences between study groups were assessed using a 6-item measure to determine patients' satisfaction with pain relief and satisfaction with side effects 48 hours after drug administration. Functional status was assessed by analyzing the change in patients' ability to perform normal activities during the course of the migraine. HRQOL was compared between treatment groups at 24 hours using the Migraine Quality of Life Questionnaire. End points were assessed using entries from patients' 48-hour diaries.; A total of 1173 patients were treated with almotriptan or sumatriptan. There were no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups in terms of satisfaction with pain relief; however, patients in the almotriptan group were significantly more satisfied (less bothered) with side effects than those receiving sumatriptan (P = 0.016). Functional status and HRQOL outcomes were not significantly different between groups.; In this study, migraine patients treated with almotriptan were significantly more satisfied with the side-effect profile of the drug than patients treated with sumatriptan.

Eletriptan is a new 5-HT 1B/1D agonist with high potency and selectivity at 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. It is effective in animal models in which the vascular and neurogenic mechanisms implicated in migraine were measured. Eletriptan is selective for the intracranial blood vessels over other extracranial vasculature, in particular coronary arteries. Eletriptan has a rapid and complete oral absorption and a good oral bioavailability in migraineurs. In comparative trials 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg eletriptan, 100 mg sumatritpan and placebo were compared for the treatment of migraine attacks. All three doses of eletriptan were statistically superior to placebo for headache response and headache-free patients. The 80 mg dose of eletriptan was also superior to sumatriptan 100 mg. Headache recurrence, defined as return of moderate or severe headache within 24 hours of dosing and following a headache response at two hours after initial dosing, occurred in 33% of the patients following 100 mg sumatriptan and in 28%, 34% and 32% after 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg eletriptan. In another large trial, headache response rates were significantly higher for both doses of eletriptan (64% for 40 mg and 67% for 80 mg) than for two doses of sumatriptan (50% for 50 mg and 53% for 100 mg). Eletriptan 40 mg or 80 mg was also superior to ergotamine plus caffeine (Cafergot). In summary, eletriptan is a highly effective and fast-acting drug for the treatment of acute migraine attacks.",I,E

Patients responded to a questionnaire seeking information concerning the amount of time lost from usual activities during the attack. Time loss assessments were made 24 hours after the last dose taken and recorded in a diary.; Patients receiving either dose of the active compound were unable to perform their usual activities for a median period of 4 hours compared with 9 hours experienced by those taking placebo. This difference was highly statistically significant (p < 0.001). The time saving associated with eletriptan usage reflected the differences in efficacy findings in the clinical component of the study.; In this placebo-controlled trial, eletriptan produced a significant reduction in the loss of usual functioning time associated with a migraine attack. This gain clearly represents a substantial benefit to patients with migraine irrespective of how it might most appropriately be valued in monetary terms.

Cardiovascular effects were assessed by frequent recording of blood pressure and heart rate, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (recorded at 25 mm/s paper speed and 1 cm/mV and at 50 mm/s and 2 cm/mV), and continuous ECG monitoring for 12 h after each dose. ECG variables, PR, QRS, QT interval, and QT dispersion, were measured. QT intervals were adjusted for heart rate using Bazett's formula. None of the doses of almotriptan differed significantly from placebo with respect to PR, QRS, or QTc intervals, QTc dispersion, heart rate, or continuous ECG monitoring. Almotriptan 12.5 mg did not differ significantly from placebo with respect to systolic or diastolic blood pressure, but almotriptan 25 and 50 mg raised systolic blood pressure by a mean of 2.78 and 4.17 mm Hg, and diastolic blood pressure by 3.77 and 6.11 mm Hg, respectively, during 0 to 4 h after dosing. Thus none of the doses of almotriptan affected the ECG, and the 12.5-mg dose (the expected therapeutic dose) had no hemodynamic effects. Almotriptan in doses of 25 and 50 mg caused a small, dose-related increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as seen with other triptans.",4,E

Eletriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan and zolmitriptan display both increased stability to first pass metabolic inactivation by monoamine oxidase (MAO-A) and enhanced lipophilicity (4- to > 120-fold more than sumatriptan), leading to increased oral bioavailability (2- to 5-fold more than the 14% reported for oral sumatriptan). Central penetration and increased receptor affinity and selectivity for the neuronal (5-HT1D) receptor also combine to allow for lower total oral dosing (i.e., unit doses of 15 mg or less compared with 50-300 mg doses of sumatriptan) and reduced peripheral exposure to the coronary vasoconstrictor (5-HT1B) receptor. The notable exception being eletriptan, where an active P-glycoprotein blood-brain barrier efflux system effectively negates these benefits and requires an 80 mg oral dose. Differences in the metabolic balance between hepatic P450 (especially CYP 1A2) and MAO-A inactivation lead to potential drug interactions for all TELs with the oral contraceptive pill (OCP), fluvoxamine and the quinilone antibiotics (with increased triptan levels). An important but complex MAO-A interaction between a metabolite of propranolol and rizatriptan mandates dosage reduction (to 5 mg) for rizatriptan in the presence of propranolol treatment. There is also an absolute contraindication for the concurrent administration of the MAO-A inhibitor moclobemide and rizatriptan. All the new-marketed TELs have potential clinical benefits and were well-tolerated relative to sumatriptan. Both rizatriptan (10 mg) and zolmitriptan (2.5 mg and 5 mg) demonstrate at least equivalent efficacy to sumatriptan 25, 50 and 100 mg, respectively, making them suitable first line agents for moderate or severe migraine headaches. Rizatriptan has the fastest onset of effect of the TELs. Naratriptan would appear to have lower recurrent headache rate than sumatriptan, rizatriptan or zolmitriptan. Therefore, for headaches of long duration and with a tendency to recur naratriptan may be the most appropriate treatment. Thus, knowledge of the metabolic, pharmacokinetic and clinical profiles of the TELs facilitates the selection of a triptan which allows optimisation of the clinical benefits for individual patients, minimising the risk of drug interactions and a minimally effective dose to reduce potential adverse events (AEs).",E,E

The transformation of TG into NNT yielded no clinically significant difference in efficacy estimate for the range of 17.5% to 47% (N = 29 clinical trials). However, NNT and TG had a nonlinear relationship for some secondary end points.

Absorption was assessed by calculating the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from dosing to 2 hours after dosing (AUC2) and the times to first measurable plasma concentration, 10 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and maximum plasma concentration. Data for the AUC from time zero to infinity and maximum plasma concentration were used to assess standard bioequivalence, which is considered to occur when the 90% CIs for the geometric mean treatment ratios (test/reference) fall between 0.8 and 1.25.; Study 1 included 26 healthy subjects (73% men, 27% women; mean age, 39.1 years), and study 2 included 30 patients with migraine (67% women, 33% men; mean age, 42.7 years). Sumatriptan absorption was delayed with the encapsulated tablet compared with the conventional tablet 0 to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during a migraine. AUC2 values with encapsulated sumatriptan compared with the conventional tablet were 21% lower in healthy volunteers (ratio of capsule/tablet, 0.79; 90% CI, 0.588-1.050) and 27% lower in patients experiencing a migraine (ratio of capsule/tablet, 0.73; 90% CI, 0.519-1.023). Standard bioequivalence was demonstrated in both healthy volunteers and patients experiencing a migraine.; Encapsulation delayed absorption of sumatriptan 0 to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during a migraine. This delay in absorption of the encapsulated form may account for the lower efficacy of sumatriptan in some comparative studies.",I,E

However, given a choice between the 2 doses, many patients in clinical practice and clinical studies prefer the 100-mg dose.; This study was designed to assess whether patients initially dissatisfied with the efficacy of 50-mg sumatriptan tablets would be satisfied with 100-mg sumatriptan tablets.; In phase 1 of the study, triptan-naive patients with migraine (International Headache Society diagnosis) received open-label treatment of 3 migraine attacks with 50-mg sumatriptan tablets. At the end of phase 1, those who were dissatisfied with the efficacy but satisfied with the tolerability of 50-mg sumatriptan tablets entered phase 2 and were randomized in a double-blind, parallel-group fashion to receive either 50- or 100-mg sumatriptan tablets for the treatment of 3 attacks. Patients who were satisfied with the efficacy or dissatisfied with the tolerability of the 50-mg tablets in phase 1 were given the option of continuing open-label treatment with 50-mg sumatriptan tablets in phase 2. The primary end point was the percentage of patients satisfied with medication at the end of phase 2 double-blind treatment. Patient satisfaction with specific medication attributes was assessed using the Patient Perception of Migraine Questionnaire.; Seven hundred twenty-two patients were enrolled in phase 1 of the study (the intent-to-treat population), 609 of whom had evaluable satisfaction data at the end of open-label treatment. Three hundred twenty-six (54%) of these patients were satisfied with 50-mg sumatriptan tablets, whereas 283 (46%) were not satisfied. Among those who were dissatisfied, lack of efficacy was cited as the sole reason for dissatisfaction by 242 (86%). Two hundred thirty-one of those who were dissatisfied with efficacy only and wished to continue the study were randomized to double-blind treatment with either 50-mg sumatriptan tablets (n = 123; 82% female, 18% male; mean age, 37.6 years) or 100-mg sumatriptan tablets (n = 108; 86% female, 14% male; mean age, 36.0 years).

The relationship between treatment and functionality was established based on analysis of existing data from a multinational study. A Monte Carlo model was developed to simulate 1 year for each of customary therapy and six sumatriptan formulations. Costs are expressed in 1998 Canadian dollars. Sumatriptan is expected to reduce the time spent with migraine symptoms and resulting time lost. Under customary therapy, the annual cost of lost time is estimated at pound908 ($1973). With sumatriptan, these costs ranged from pound406 ($882) with subcutaneous sumatriptan to pound577 ($1254) with nasal sumatriptan 10 mg, saving pound331-502 ($719-1091) in the annual cost of time lost. All these benefits are expected to be obtained at an additional drug cost ranging from pound869 ($1889) for subcutaneous sumatriptan to pound278 ($605) for sumatriptan suppository. The cost of sumatriptan treatment is significantly offset by a substantial reduction of costs associated with time lost due to migraine symptoms.",3,E

Despite the high prevalence of migraine, data have been lacking on its impact in a working population. The advent of new therapies has stimulated interest in this area, and evidence is now available that documents the substantial impact of migraine on workplace productivity and the likelihood of untreated migraine leading to unemployment or underemployment for the patient. This paper reviews current findings of both observational and interventional studies about the impact of migraine on productivity and employment. When considered in the light of migraine demographics, the high prevalence of migraine, and its low consultation and treatment rates, this evidence indicates that improved screening and treatment for this common condition could have a substantial impact on worker productivity and on patient well-being.",E,E

We hypothesized that sumatriptan, a 5-HT(1D) agonist, would diminish 5-HT release, thereby worsening OCD symptoms. We further hypothesized that by beginning to desensitize 5-HT(1D) receptors, sumatriptan pretreatment would promote a faster response or an increased likelihood of response to subsequent treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.; The five sumatriptan subjects' OCD symptom worsening, as measured by the Yale-Brown scale ( upward arrow 17.6% (S.D. 14.6)), was significant when compared to the slight symptom decrease in the five placebo subjects ( downward arrow 5.2% (S.D. 4.9), P<0.015).

As part of the stratified treatment of migraine, those patients whose headaches are mild or moderate may benefit from nontriptan medications. Additionally, early treatment of acute migraine before the headache has become moderate or severe may improve response to treatment.; This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone with acetaminophen and sumatriptan succinate in the early stages of a single migraine attack.

Sumatriptan was the first of these compounds to be developed, and offered improved efficacy and tolerability over ergot-derived compounds. The development of sumatriptan was quickly followed by a number of 'second generation' triptan compounds, characterised by improved pharmacokinetic properties and/or tolerability profiles. Triptans are believed to effect migraine relief by binding to serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine) receptors in the brain, where they act to induce vasoconstriction of extracerebral blood vessels and also reduce neurogenic inflammation. Although the pharmacological mechanism of the triptans is similar, their pharmacokinetic properties are distinct. For example, bioavailability of oral formulations ranges between 14% (sumatriptan) and 74% (naratriptan), and their elimination half-life ranges from 2 hours (sumatriptan and rizatriptan) to 25 hours (frovatriptan). Clearly, such diverse pharmacokinetic properties will influence the effectiveness of the compounds and favour the prescription of one over another in different patient populations. This article reviews the pharmacological properties of the triptans (time to peak plasma concentration, half-life, bioavailability and receptor binding) and relates these properties to efficacy and time of onset. It also considers the effects of concomitant medication, food, age and disease on the pharmacokinetics of the compounds. In addition, the relative merits, such as headache recurrence, tolerability and route of administration, are discussed. Finally, the performance of the triptans is considered in the context of direct head-to-head comparative trials that have assessed the efficacy profile of the compounds.",2,E

In addition, the safety and tolerability profile of almotriptan has been demonstrated in a number of controlled clinical trials. Sumatriptan is generally safe and well tolerated; however, in controlled clinical trials, it has been associated with chest symptoms (pressure, warmth, and other unpleasant sensations) with an incidence of 3% to 5%.; Three phase 1 dose-finding and pharmacokinetic studies in healthy men and women volunteers were reviewed to assess the safety and tolerability of oral almotriptan at single doses ranging from 2 to 200 mg. The objective of one study was to evaluate cardiovascular safety. Two phase 2 trials assessed the safety and tolerability of single doses of 2 to 150 mg in migraine (n=911). Two phase 3 trials assessed the safety and tolerability of a single 12.5-mg oral dose after three attacks (n=910) and repeated doses of 12.5 mg for multiple attacks over the long term (n=747). All studies were conducted in Europe. Data from the United States is currently being analyzed and will be published at a later date.; In phase 2 and 3 trials comprising more than 2500 patients with migraine and 15 000 attacks, adverse events were infrequent and mild. The most common events-dizziness, nausea and vomiting, headache, fatigue, paresthesia, and drowsiness-were reported in fewer than 3% of patients. At the recommended therapeutic dose of 12.5 mg, the adverse events profile was not statistically different from placebo. The incidence of chest symptoms was 0.2% in the phase 3 trials. The long-term safety and tolerability profile after treatment of more than 10 000 attacks was similar to that following the single-dose studies. In all clinical trials, almotriptan demonstrated a very favorable adverse event profile, particularly with respect to nonischemic-related chest symptoms.; Almotriptan was safe and well tolerated in nearly all adult patients with migraine, with and without aura, enrolled in these studies. The incidence of chest symptoms in preclinical studies was substantially lower than that reported for sumatriptan in premarketing studies, indicating that almotriptan may be better tolerated than sumatriptan at clinically anticipated doses. However, any potential difference in cardiovascular safety between almotriptan and sumatriptan cannot be determined or inferred from this data. Cardiovascular risk profiles for all drugs within this class (triptans) should be considered similar.

Almost twice as many patients preferred rizatriptan 10-mg rapidly disintegrating tablet to sumatriptan 50-mg tablet (64.3 vs. 35.7%, p < or = 0.001). Faster relief of headache pain was the most important reason for the preference, cited by 46.9% of patients preferring rizatriptan and 43.4% of patients who preferred sumatriptan. Headache relief at 2 h was 75.9% with rizatriptan and 66.6% with sumatriptan (p < or = 0.001), with rizatriptan being superior to sumatriptan within 30 min of dosing. Fifty-five percent of patients were pain free 2 h after rizatriptan, compared with 42.1% treated with sumatriptan (p < or = 0.001), rizatriptan being superior within 1 h of treatment. Forty-one percent of patients taking rizatriptan were pain free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication, compared to 32.3% of patients on sumatriptan. Rizatriptan was also superior to sumatriptan in terms of the proportions of patients with no nausea, phonophobia or photophobia, and patients with normal function 2 h after treatment intake (p < 0.05). More patients were (completely, very or somewhat) satisfied 2 h after treatment with rizatriptan (73.3%) than 2 h after treatment with sumatriptan (59.0%) (p < or = 0.001). Additionally, 2 h after the dose, more patients found rizatriptan to be very convenient, convenient or somewhat convenient (87.2%) than they did sumatriptan (76.3%) (p < or = 0.001). Both active treatments were well tolerated. The most common side effects with rizatriptan and sumatriptan were nausea (6.6 and 6.9% of patients, respectively), dizziness (6.1 and 5.8%) and somnolence (7.4 and 6.7%).",I,3

Four consecutive attacks were thus treated. The efficacy analysis was done for observed cases. The main outcome measure was reduction of the severity of the attacks.; No differences were observed in the migraine characteristics or the number of treatments of the patients from the different groups. Dihydroergotamine 1 mg tended to provide better relief than 0.5 mg, although the effect was not statistically significant. Patients taking DHE used less rescue medications, with a dose-dependent effect. Side effects were reported by four patients receiving DHE but not placebo. The tolerability of the drug was assessed as good by 94% of the patients.; These findings suggest that DHE nasal spray is well tolerated and has dose-dependent efficacy in migraine.",3,E

Patients with frequent attacks may also receive propranolol or other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists for migraine prophylaxis. The present studies investigated the potential for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between beta-adrenoceptor blockers and rizatriptan.; Four double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover investigations were performed in a total of 51 healthy subjects. A single 10 mg dose of rizatriptan was administered after 7 days' administration of propranolol (60 and 120 mg twice daily), nadolol (80 mg twice daily), metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) or placebo. Rizatriptan pharmacokinetics were assessed. In vitro incubations of rizatriptan and sumatriptan with various beta-adrenoceptor blockers were performed in human S9 fraction. Production of the indole-acetic acid-MAO-A metabolite of each triptan was measured.; Administration of rizatriptan during propranolol treatment (120 mg twice daily for 7.5 days) increased the AUC(0, infinity) for rizatriptan by approximately 67% and the Cmax by approximately 75%. A reduction in the dose of propranolol (60 mg twice daily) and/or the incorporation of a delay (1 or 2 h) between propranolol and rizatriptan administration did not produce a statistically significant change in the effect of propranolol on rizatriptan pharmacokinetics. Administration of rizatriptan together with nadolol (80 mg twice daily) or metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) for 7 days did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan. No untoward adverse experiences attributable to the pharmacokinetic interaction between propranolol and rizatriptan were observed, and no subjects developed serious clinical, laboratory, or other significant adverse experiences during coadministration of rizatriptan with any of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers. In vitro incubations showed that propranolol, but not other beta-adrenoceptor blockers significantly inhibited the production of the indole-acetic acid metabolite of rizatriptan and sumatriptan.; These results suggest that propranolol increases plasma concentrations of rizatriptan by inhibiting monoamine oxidase-A. When prescribing rizatriptan to migraine patients receiving propranolol for prophylaxis, the 5 mg dose of rizatriptan is recommended. Administration with other beta-adrenoceptor blockers does not require consideration of a dose adjustment.",4,E

This study used ergotamine and sumatriptan prescription data representing inhabitants of eight cities in the Netherlands and covering the period of 1991-1997. The yearly incidence of new users between 1991 and 1997 was estimated for both drugs as well as for the drug of first choice to be prescribed to patients initiating specific abortive migraine treatment with either ergotamine or sumatriptan. Intra-individual ergotamine and sumatriptan usage patterns, characterized by single (incidental), continuous (rate of retention) or switch use, were examined for five patient cohorts, each for a follow-up period of 1 year. During the year of sumatriptan introduction (1991-1992), the overall incidence of new use for both drugs was highest (5.4 per 1000 inhabitants). Hereafter, a substantial reduction of more than 50% was observed. From 1992 to 1996, the yearly incidence of ergotamine first-time use was significantly higher than that of sumatriptan and up to 1996 ergotamine was more than twice as likely than sumatriptan to be prescribed to patients initiating specific abortive treatment. Hereafter, sumatriptan was as likely as ergotamine to be prescribed as the drug of first choice, which coincided with the full reimbursement of sumatriptan tablets. Overall, neurologists were more likely than general practitioners (GPs), to prescribe sumatriptan as the drug of first choice. Approximately half of the total study population were identified as single-time users. This phenomonen occurred more frequently in the ergotamine cohorts. The sumatriptan cohorts displayed a slight yet significant stronger retention rate compared with the ergotamine cohorts. The overall impact of sumatriptan on ergotamine use in The Netherlands was marginal, predominantly due to GP's adherence to migraine treatment guidelines and reimbursement policies concerning sumatriptan tablets. Overall, incidental use was relatively high and may reflect the reported difficulties in diagnosing migraine, lack of patient-doctor consultation, or that anticipated benefits of the drug were not achieved. Further study is required to clarify these issues.",E,E

The recommendation to delay triptan intake until headache intensity is at least moderate is merely a habit generated by the protocol used in triptan trials and a nonvalidated attempt to reduce costs. It is also favoured by the few studies suggesting that sumatriptan is less effective when given early in an attack, especially during the aura phase. Recent retrospective analyses of small numbers of 'protocol violators' in controlled trials of sumatriptan suggest that the drug is more efficient when taken while the headache is mild. Pain-free responses and therapeutic gains over aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)-metoclopramide or ergotamine-caffeine combinations were increased under these conditions. The available circumstantial evidence is reviewed and discussed. Before any conclusion can be drawn and recommendation made, results are awaited from randomised controlled trials specifically addressing whether or not triptans are more efficient in mild headache. Meanwhile, there seems to be no medical reason to withhold treatment of a mild headache with a triptan as long as triptan intake does not exceed 1 or 2 doses per week. Most mild headaches in patients with migraine appear indeed to be mild migraine attacks, even when the headache characteristics are those of tension-type headache.",E,E

The number of responders (reduction of headache severity from moderate or severe headache before treatment to mild or absent at 2 h), was 59 (37.8%) on placebo, 250 (80.9%) on alniditan 1.4 mg, 120 (85.1%) on alniditan 1.8 mg, and 276 (87.1%) on sumatriptan. Response was significantly higher (P < 0.001) with alniditan 1.4 mg than with placebo, and significantly lower (P = 0.036) with alniditan 1.4 mg than with sumatriptan. Recurrence rates were: 22 (37.3%) with placebo, 87 (34.8%) with alniditan 1.4 mg, 35 (29.2%) with alniditan 1.8 mg and 108 (39.1%) with sumatriptan. Adverse events occurred in 577/924 (62.4%) subjects, i.e. in 62/157 (39.5%) with placebo, 214/309 (69.3%) with alniditan 1.4 mg, 91/141 (64.5%) with alniditan 1.8 mg and 210/317 (66.2%) with sumatriptan 6 mg. Sumatriptan was significantly better than alniditan 1.4 mg for pain free at 2 h. The difference, however, was small and clinically not important. For alniditan, a dose-dependent adverse event relationship was seen. The safety profile of alniditan 1.4 mg was similar to that of sumatriptan.",I,3

The objective of this open-label, cross-over study was to explore patients' preferences for sumatriptan 50 mg vs. zolmitriptan 2.5 mg tablets, focusing on factors influencing this preference. One hundred consecutive migraine patients attending our clinics were asked to treat three attacks with each medication and then fill out a preference questionnaire. Ninety-four migraineurs completed the trial and 42 (44%, 95% CI 34-58%) reported that they preferred zolmitriptan 2.5 mg over sumatriptan 50 mg tablets and 27 (29%, 20-38%) preferred sumatriptan 50 mg. The remaining 25 (27%, 18-36%) did not show any preference. For the initial treatment of the attacks, there were more patients needing just one tablet of zolmitriptan 2.5 mg compared with sumatriptan 50 mg (67 vs. 39%). The reasons for preference among those 69 patients who had shown preference for either of the two triptans were: a faster onset of action (speed of onset) (73%), a longer duration of the effects (39%), fewer adverse events (35%) and lower price (13%). Only one-quarter of the studied migraine population thought that sumatriptan 50 mg and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg were equivalent, which suggests that most migraine patients differentiate between triptans. A faster onset of action (speed of onset) was the most important reason for preference.",I,E

Each household member with severe headache was asked to respond to questions about symptoms, frequency, and severity of headaches and about headache-related disability. Diagnostic criteria for migraine were based on those of the International Headache Society. This report is restricted to individuals 12 years and older.; Of the 43 527 age-eligible individuals, 29 727 responded to the questionnaire for a 68.3% response rate. The prevalence of migraine was 18.2% among females and 6.5% among males. Approximately 23% of households contained at least one member suffering from migraine. Migraine prevalence was higher in whites than in blacks and was inversely related to household income. Prevalence increased from aged 12 years to about aged 40 years and declined thereafter in both sexes. Fifty-three percent of respondents reported that their severe headaches caused substantial impairment in activities or required bed rest. Approximately 31% missed at least 1 day of work or school in the previous 3 months because of migraine; 51% reported that work or school productivity was reduced by at least 50%.; Two methodologically identical national surveys in the United States conducted 10 years apart show that the prevalence and distribution of migraine have remained stable over the last decade. Migraine-associated disability remains substantial and pervasive. The number of migraineurs has increased from 23.6 million in 1989 to 27.9 million in 1999 commensurate with the growth of the population. Migraine is an important target for public health interventions because it is highly prevalent and disabling.",8,E

It has recently been reported that nasal sumatriptan is effective in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. In younger children, it is yet to be characterized. In addition, many children have significant amounts of vomiting with their migraines, limiting their use of oral medications.; Children with headache were evaluated by a child neurologist, child psychologist, and pediatric nurse practitioner. Clinical and International Headache Society diagnoses were established for each child. Patients with headaches that were either unresponsive to oral medications or had significant vomiting were treated with nasal sumatriptan. Initial administration and tolerability were performed in the Headache Center at Cincinnati's Children's Hospital Medical Center. Patients or their parents were contacted to assess the overall effectiveness of nasal sumatriptan after home administration.; Ten patients aged between 5 and 12 years (mean, 9.9 years) received either a 5-mg (n = 2) or 20-mg (n = 8) dose of sumatriptan. All 10 patients had a clinical diagnosis of migraine; 7 met the International Headache Society criteria for migraine. The mean age of headache onset was 6.6 years. A total of 57 headaches were treated; 47 (82.5%) responded to sumatriptan. Of the patients who treated headaches, the mean number of headaches treated was 5.2, while the mean number of responsive headaches was 4.3. One patient had no response, 2 patients had a 50% response, and 6 patients had 100% response to the nasal sumatriptan. Three patients reported persistent ""bad taste.""; This report demonstrates that nasal sumatriptan may be effective in aborting migraine in young children (aged 5 to 12 years). It also suggests that there may be subgroups for which it works well. This information suggests that double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are necessary to determine the overall effectiveness of nasal sumatriptan in this age group.",3,E

In this two-period crossover study, 12 healthy young subjects (6 males and 6 females) received 1 mg rizatriptan following 14 days of treatment with placebo or paroxetine (20 mg once daily). Plasma was sampled for rizatriptan and N-monodesmethyl rizatriptan, a minor but active metabolite of rizatriptan. Safety evaluations included monitoring for adverse events, vital signs, and visual analog scale assessment of mood. Plasma levels of rizatriptan and N-monodesmethyl rizatriptan were not altered when rizatriptan was administered with paroxetine compared to the placebo. Clinically, coadministration of rizatriptan with paroxetine was well tolerated. Blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature changes during the observation period did not differ to a clinically significant degree when rizatriptan was administered with paroxetine compared to the placebo. No effects on mood occurred following treatment with the combination compared to rizatriptan alone.

Rizatriptan ODT is an orally disintegrating formulation of rizatriptan, a selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist. This study was conducted to determine patient preference between rizatriptan ODT 10-mg and sumatriptan 50-mg tablet for the acute treatment of migraine.; This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, two-period crossover study conducted in the United States with 524 enrolled patients. Patients treated a single moderate or severe headache in each treatment period. Patients treated one migraine with either rizatriptan ODT 10-mg or sumatriptan 50-mg tablet, then treated a second migraine with the alternate therapy. Patients completed diary assessments at baseline, and 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes postdose and rated headache severity on a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). At the final study visit following treatment of their second migraine, patients expressed preference for one of the two study medications by completing an interviewer-administered Global Preference Question and then responded to a self-administered series of questions to capture their most important reason for preferring one study medication over the other. Safety measurements were recorded through standard adverse experience reporting.; Three hundred eighty-six patients treated two migraine attacks. For those patients who expressed a preference for either rizatriptan ODT or sumatriptan (n = 374), the percentage of patients who preferred rizatriptan ODT 10-mg (57%, n = 213) was significantly greater than those who preferred sumatriptan 50-mg tablet (43%, n = 161) (P<.01). For those patients who treated two migraine attacks and had drug severity measures for both attacks (n = 384), a significantly greater percentage of patients reported pain relief after taking rizatriptan ODT than sumatriptan at the 45- and 60-minute time points (38% versus 29% and 58% versus 49%, respectively) (P<.01).

A health service payer perspective was adopted and the time horizon was 1 year. Data inputs were: (i) the frequency and disability of migraine, derived from population-based studies; (ii) disability level-specific treatment response rates for over-the-counter analgesics,aspirin/metoclopramide and zolmitriptan as the representative of high-end therapy obtained from an international consensus opinion enquiry; and (iii) unit costs of healthcare obtained from UK health service sources.; The estimated 1-year direct healthcare costs per primary care patient with migraine were pound sterling 156.82 for stepped care and sterling pound 151.57 for stratified care. Estimates of treatment response rates were 40 and 71% for stepped and stratified care, respectively. The cost per successfully treated attack was sterling pound 23.43 for stepped care and sterling pound 12.60 for stratified care. Stratified care remained cost effective when tested in a wide range of one-way sensitivity analyses, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed the cost effectiveness of stratified care to be significant at the 3% level. Conditional confidence analysis showed that the level of confidence in the cost effectiveness of stratified care varied positively with the case mix, i.e. in populations where the proportion of moderate and severely disabled patients with migraine was greater than 25%, the cost effectiveness of stratified care remained statistically significant.; A stratified-care treatment strategy (including zolmitriptan as the representative of high-end therapy) is a highly cost-effective method of managing migraine in the primary care setting compared with stepped care, delivering improved clinical outcomes at no additional cost.",2,E

Rizatriptan is a potent, selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist shown to be fast, effective and well tolerated in the acute treatment of migraine. We investigated patients' overall satisfaction with treatment in studies in which direct comparisons with other triptans were made. Data from five double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in which rizatriptan 10 mg was compared with another triptan were included in the analysis. Rizatriptan 10 mg was compared with sumatriptan 100 mg in one parallel study (n = 916), sumatriptan 50 mg in two crossover studies (n = 1599), naratriptan 2.5 mg in one parallel study (n = 502), and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg in one parallel study (n = 701). Satisfaction was reported by patients on a seven-point scale ranging from 'completely satisfied, couldn't be better' to 'completely dissatisfied, couldn't be worse' at 2 hours after dosing. The percent of patients in the top two 'satisfied' categories (completely or very satisfied) were analysed. More patients on rizatriptan 10 mg were completely or very satisfied compared with sumatriptan 100 mg (33% vs 26%, p < 0.05), sumatriptan 50 mg (40% vs 35%, p < 0.05), naratriptan 2.5 mg (33% vs 19%, p < 0.01), and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (38% vs 30%, p < 0.05). In all five studies more patients treated with rizatriptan 10 mg or other triptans were completely or very satisfied with treatment than patients receiving placebo (p < 0.001, except naratriptan vs placebo p = 0.004). The results, combined with the superior efficacy profile (fast, effective, well tolerated) of rizatriptan 10 mg, should enhance the treatment of migraine headache and lead to improved therapeutic intervention in clinical practice.",I,E

Migraine-related resource use data were obtained from the managed care organization's medical and pharmacy claims databases. The primary outcome measure for this economic analysis was the total disability time that patients experienced because of migraine. Patients reported time missed from work and usual nonwork activities because of migraine on self-administered questionnaires at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after initiation of sumatriptan.; Initiation of sumatriptan resulted in a decrease of 662 migraine-disability-days for work and 1236 migraine-disability-days for nonwork activities during the 6 months of the study (decrease from 27.8 to 17.2 days per person), totaling 1898 migraine-disability-days averted with sumatriptan therapy. Migraine-related medical costs were lower after sumatriptan was initiated ($18,351 vs $26,192), whereas migraine-related pharmacy costs were lower with prior nontriptan drug therapy ($22,209 vs $74,861). The overall net cost savings after sumatriptan was initiated in these patients was $222,332 ($1249 per patient) with a benefit-to-cost ratio of $5.67 gained for each health care dollar spent from a societal perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $25 for each additional migraine-disability-day averted by using sumatriptan vs nontriptan drug therapy. Sensitivity analysis showed that changes in medical costs had little effect on the ratios and that sumatriptan remained cost-beneficial across a wide range of patient wages.; This study showed that initiation of sumatriptan in patients previously receiving nontriptan therapy was cost-effective and had an economic benefit for patients, employers, and society. Sumatriptan also helped patients and physicians achieve goals recommended by the US Headache Consortium by reducing patients' disability and thus improving their ability to function at work and nonwork activities.",I,E

Little data exists on the use of multiple formulations in a single patient population.; A prospective, open-label, outpatient study recruited patients from a single center during the period from January 1998 through June 1998. Entry criteria included International Headache Society migraine diagnostic codes 1.1 or 1.2 and an established response to sumatriptan tablets or nasal spray. Patients who enrolled were allowed to use subcutaneous sumatriptan as either primary or rescue therapy for individual migraine attacks.; Two hundred eighteen (80%) of 273 patients on tablets and 40 (85%) of 47 patients on nasal spray enrolled. During a period of 6 months, 61% of the patients on tablets and 85% of the patients using the nasal spray used at least one subcutaneous dose of sumatriptan. This system was efficacious and well tolerated. The majority of injections were used as rescue treatments following a failed oral or nasal dose. Two percent withdrew due to lack of efficacy, and 6% withdrew due to adverse events; however, 92% professed satisfaction with subcutaneous sumatriptan as an available tool for migraine management.; A system of stratified care using multiple formulations of sumatriptan is efficacious, well tolerated, and preferable to a program involving a single form of the drug.",I,E

All patients underwent standard inpatient withdrawal therapy for 14 days.; The duration of withdrawal headache was shorter in patients overusing triptans (4.1 days) than in patients overusing ergots (6.7 days) or analgesics (9.5 days; p < 0.002).

11717813,Development of CGRP antagonists for the treatment of migraine.,Animals; Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Piperazines; Quinazolines,"Doods, H","Migraine is one of the most common neurological disorders, involving periodical attacks of headache and nausea as well as a plethora of other symptoms. Although considerable progress has been made, the pathophysiology of migraine is still not understood. However, several observations point to an involvement of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Migraine headache involves the activation of the trigeminal system and dilatation of cranial vessels. CGRP is localized to neurons in the trigeminal ganglia and CGRP levels are increased during a migraine attack, presumably causing the vasodilation observed. Accordingly, it is conceivable that inhibition of CGRP-evoked dilatation of the cranial vessels may provide a novel treatment for migraine headache. The non-peptidic CGRP antagonist BIBN-4096BS (Boehringer Ingelheim) is presently under clinical investigation to assess the importance of CGRP in migraine headache and to answer the question of whether the concept of CGRP antagonists may offer advantages, e.g., higher efficacy, lower recurrence rate or improved side-effect profile, compared to the currently used antimigraine drugs.",E,E

In surveys, they consistently cite several attributes they seek in a migraine medication: rapid pain relief, complete pain relief, ability to return to normal functioning, relief of migraine-associated symptoms, reduction in headache recurrence, and minimal adverse effects. When prescribing medication for patients with migraine, physicians should respect patients' treatment preferences and select drugs that most closely meet patients' needs. As a class, the 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists, or triptans, have many of these attributes, including effectively relieving pain and associated symptoms and allowing patients to return fairly quickly to their normal activities. However, differences have emerged in the ability of specific triptans to satisfy patient preferences.

Headaches may at times be severe and affect patient compliance with this treatment modality. The 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist sumatriptan has been reported to be effective for post-ECT headache in several case reports. The aim of the present open-label study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of intranasal sumatriptan for post-ECT headache.; Patients undergoing ECT who experienced moderate-to-severe post-ECT headache were enrolled in the study. Patients were asked to rate their headache severity and describe headache characteristics using a standard headache diary. Headaches rated as severe or moderate were treated with 20 mg of intranasal sumatriptan. Additional headache ratings were recorded at 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2 hours after sumatriptan administration and compared with baseline values.; Eight female patients (ages 34-45 years old) participated in the trial and experienced a total of 13 post-ECT headaches, which were treated with intranasal sumatriptan. Of the headaches treated, six (46.2%) were described as severe and seven (53.8%) were characterized as moderate in severity. Twelve (92.3%) of the treated headaches responded by the 2 hour posttreatment time point and 11 (84.6%) had responded within 1 hour. Comparisons made at the 1- and 2-hour time point revealed a statistically significant improvement from baseline (p = 0.002). Of the 12 headaches that responded, 6 (50%) were reported as no pain and 5 (38.5%) were reported as only mild pain at 1 hour following treatment. At the 2-hour assessment, an additional headache, which had previously not responded, was rated at mild resulting in six (50%) headaches with complete resolution of pain and six (50%) with a decrease in pain symptoms from moderate or severe to mild. Overall, sumatriptan treatment was well tolerated, and no significant adverse effects or changes in vital signs were recorded. In no case was a second dose of sumatriptan given. The most common complaint was the taste of the medication (n = 4), which was not treatment limiting. No patient withdrew from the study due to an adverse event.; Intranasal sumatriptan spray may be an effective, well-tolerated, and prompt treatment for patients experiencing moderate-to-severe post-ECT headache. Preventing post-ECT headache may contribute to patient compliance with the ECT treatment modality.

11772240,Migraine and beyond: cardiovascular therapeutic potential for CGRP modulators.,Animals; Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide; Cardiovascular Diseases; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Vasodilator Agents,"Doggrell, S A","CGRP is a potent vasodilator that has been shown to have a physiological and/or pathological role in neurogenic inflammation, headaches including migraine, thermal injury, circulatory shock, pregnancy and menopause, hypertension and heart failure and is known to be cardioprotective. CGRP is also a positive inotrope and increases heart rate. Clinical trials have shown beneficial effects of the vasodilatory action of CGRP in hypertension, angina, heart failure, Raynaud's disease and venous stasis ulcers. However, the clinical potential of CGRP is limited as it has to be given by infusion and is quickly broken down. Oral long acting CGRP-mimetics may have potential in disorders in which CGRP has been shown to be beneficial. CGRP-mimetics include capsaicin/vanilloid receptor agonists and gene transfer of an adenoviral vector that encodes prepro-CGRP. CGRP inhibitors have therapeutic potential in conditions in which excessive CGRP-mediated vasodilatation is present; neurogenic inflammation, migraine and other headaches, thermal injury, circulatory shock and flushing in menopause. CGRP inhibitors include capsaicin, antagonists at capsaicin/vanilloid receptors, civamide, CGRP receptor antagonists and 5-HT1D-receptor agonists. Drugs that are 5-HT1D-receptor agonists, the 'triptans' are already commonly used in migraine and the first small molecule CGRP antagonist, BIBN4096BS, is under clinical investigation for the treatment of migraine.",E,E

It is rapidly absorbed and has a bioavailability of 50% compared to 14% for sumatriptan. The relatively high lipophilicity of eletriptan compared to sumatriptan may explain its faster oral absorption and shorter time to onset of action. Results from comparative studies between oral eletriptan and sumatriptan indicate that eletriptan 80 mg was superior to sumatriptan 100 mg in onset of action, headache response rate, pain free response rate and relief of associated migraine symptoms at the 1 or 2 h time intervals.

It accounts for up to 28% of patients presenting to a gastroenterology practice and poses a significant personal, societal and economic burden internationally. The Manning, Rome I and Rome II criteria were developed to identify appropriate IBS patients for entry into IBS studies in a consistent manner. Refinements in the understanding of the physiology of the enteric nervous system (ENS), which controls motility, secretion and sensation, provided the basis for our comprehension of the pathophysiology of IBS. Visceral hypersensitivity and neurotransmitter imbalance currently receive the most attention as possible mechanisms of IBS. This article outlines conventional treatments and reviews the data on emerging and experimental therapies for IBS. Emerging therapies for IBS using 5-HT mediation include 5-HT(3) antagonists, such as ondasetron, granisetron and alosetron, as well as 5-HT(4) agonists such as tegaserod and prucalopride. In addition to opioid agonists (e.g. fedotozine) several other drugs that act on other ENS receptors are being studied.

Both acute and chronic gastroparesis occur frequently; gastric emptying of solids is delayed in 30% to 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus, functional dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux disease. While many patients with gastroparesis experience upper gastrointestinal symptoms that adversely affect quality of life, the concept that symptoms are inevitably the direct outcome of delay in gastric emptying is now recognized to be overly simplistic. In contrast, the potential impact of gastroparesis on oral drug absorption and blood glucose control in patients with diabetes mellitus has probably been underestimated.

Its efficacy and tolerability have been assessed in a number of randomised, controlled trials in over 4800 adults with moderate or severe attacks of migraine. Oral almotriptan has a rapid onset of action (significant headache relief is observed 0.5 hours after administration of a 12.5mg dose) and efficacy is sustained in most patients who respond by 2 hours. The drug is significantly more effective than placebo as measured by a number of parameters including 2-hour headache response and pain-free response rates. Other symptoms of migraine, including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, are also alleviated by almotriptan. The efficacy of oral almotriptan appears to be maintained over repeated doses for multiple attacks of migraine treated over a long period (up to 1 year). High headache response rates were reported over all attacks without tachyphylaxis. For the relief of single attacks of migraine, oral almotriptan 12.5mg had similar efficacy to oral sumatriptan 50mg. Patients given almotriptan report less concern with adverse effects than patients given sumatriptan. The lower incidence of chest pain following treatment with almotriptan than with sumatriptan may lead to a reduction in direct costs, with fewer patients requiring management of chest pain. Almotriptan is well tolerated. Most adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity, transient, and generally resolved without intervention or the need for treatment withdrawal. The most common adverse events associated with oral almotriptan 12.5mg treatment were dizziness, paraesthesia, nausea, fatigue, headache, somnolence, skeletal pain, vomiting and chest symptoms. The incidence of adverse events did not differ from placebo and decreased in the longer term. Almotriptan can be coadministered with drugs that share a common hepatic metabolic path; in addition, dosage reduction is required only in the presence of severe renal or hepatic impairment.; Almotriptan is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe attacks of migraine in adults. An oral dose of almotriptan 12.5mg has shown greater efficacy than placebo; current data indicate that efficacy is similar to that of oral sumatriptan 50mg, and is maintained in the long term (<or=1 year). Almotriptan has a good adverse event profile and a generally similar overall tolerability profile to sumatriptan; of note, almotriptan is associated with a significantly lower incidence of chest pain than sumatriptan. However, further clinical experience is required to clearly define the place of almotriptan among the other currently available triptans. Nevertheless, because triptans have an important place in various management regimens, and because the nature of individual patient response to triptans is idiosyncratic, almotriptan is likely to become a useful treatment option in the management of adults with moderate or severe migraine headaches.",I,E

For the majority of secondary end points, the two treatments demonstrated comparable efficacy. However, post hoc analysis showed that significantly more patients receiving zolmitriptan were free of pain 2 h after the first dose in all 3 attacks compared with patients receiving acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide (10.7 vs. 5.3%; odds ratio 2.19, 95% CI 1.23-4.03; p = 0.0095).

Both treatments reduced migraine-associated nausea, vomiting, phonophobia and photophobia. There were no important inter-group differences with respect to the onset of meaningful migraine relief, the frequency of headache recurrence, the usage or efficacy of a second dose of medication or the use of escape medication. However, at the last attack, the proportion of patients who expressed overall satisfaction with the treatment was significantly higher in the zolmitriptan group, i.e. 83.7%, versus 75.0% with acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide (p = 0.0346).

Cluster headache exhibits diurnal and seasonal rhythmicity. While cluster headache has traditionally been thought of as a vascular headache disorder, its periodicity suggests involvement of the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, the biological clock. Normal circadian function and seasonal changes occurring in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and pineal gland are correlated to the clinical features and abnormalities of circadian rhythm seen in cluster headache. Abnormalities in the secretion of melatonin and cortisol in patients with cluster headache, neuroimaging of cluster headache attacks, and the use of melatonin as preventative therapy in cluster headache are discussed in this review. While the majority of studies exploring the relationship between circadian rhythms and cluster headache are not new, we have entered a new diagnostic and therapeutic era in primary headache disorders. The time has come to use the evidence for a disorder of circadian rhythm in cluster headache to further development of chronobiotics in the treatment of this disorder.",2,E

However, the results are more ambiguous from the perspective of the health care payer: reductions in non-drug medical costs are unlikely to offset fully the high drug cost. Thus far, few analyses have explicitly included quality of life (QOL) in their analyses and pharmacoeconomic analyses comparing the different triptans are scant.

These conditions involve central and peripheral physiological changes, together with psychological factors. Methodological problems have included a poor appreciation of the physiological and psychological correlates of patients' symptoms, a lack of animal models of proven relevance, and safety issues. Government, patient pressure groups and the Internet can also influence a drug's success. Most recent interest has focused on the serotonin (5-HT) modifying drugs. Cisapride has been withdrawn in some countries because of concerns related to QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. The 5-HT3 antagonists, developed to modify visceral sensation, have caused constipation; alosetron, also withdrawn, caused ischaemic colitis. The 5-HT4 agonists induce peristalsis; tegaserod and prucalopride, both delayed in their development due to issues of safety and efficacy, benefit patients with 'constipation-predominant' irritable bowel syndrome or idiopathic constipation. 5-HT1 agonists improve impaired gastric accommodation and symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia. Antidepressants also affect serotonin metabolism. Previous examples of success in this area involved drugs targeted at peripheral receptors mediating motor function or secretion. Modification of sensory function is a much more challenging objective. The experience with serotonin modifying drugs has been mixed, and some important lessons are there to be learnt.",E,E

This uncertainty is reflected in studies that show both underdiagnosis and undertreatment of migraine. While the diagnosis can be assisted by criteria from the International Headache Society, other approaches may be useful in clinical practice. Treatment of migraine must be based on an individualized patient strategy that integrates education, patient participation, and effective use of pharmacological interventions. Many patients, despite self-treatment with simple analgesics, continue to suffer considerable disability associated with their migraines. Triptans, which are more effective at relieving migraine symptoms and maintaining patient function than are nonspecific therapies, are used in only a minority of patients with migraine. Treatment goals of rapid, complete relief with no recurrence and minimal adverse effects can be achieved when effective therapy is matched to individual patient goals.

Both parallel and crossover studies may be suitable in clinical trials of antimigraine agents, although the latter are a better choice in patient preference and bioequivalence studies. Although various efficacy measures are used to assess treatment effect, the 2-hour pain free rate (total resolution of pain within 2 hours after an initial moderate to severe headache) is preferred because it is clinically relevant and is relatively 'placebo-insensitive'. Various migraine surveys have indicated that a rapid onset of therapeutic effect is a highly desirable attribute of an antimigraine drug. Therefore, accurate measurements of treatment effect before 2 hours are becoming increasingly emphasised. Consistency of effect across multiple attacks adds to the understanding of the therapeutic efficacy of a test drug. Finally, preference and satisfaction studies allow us to assess patients' global impression of a particular treatment, weighing the positive effects on pain and associated symptoms of migraine against potential adverse effects.",I,E

With 835 patients in its intention-to-treat efficacy analysis, DISC compared a stratified care strategy, where initial therapy was based on clinical need as determined by the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) and two stepped care strategies (across attacks and within attacks), where first-line therapy with a simple combination analgesic was escalated, if response had been inadequate, to zolmitriptan, a migraine-specific therapy.; To report on the cost effectiveness of these three strategies from a societal perspective.; A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken using data from the DISC study, and including both health service and productivity costs. Data were collected prospectively on drug usage (main therapy and rescue medication); resource use associated with adverse events was estimated by a clinician blinded to treatment strategy. Health service resource use was costed using UK unit costs (1999 to 2000 values). Data were collected using diary cards on the amount of time patients lost from work, and on reduced effectiveness at work, due to a migraine attack. This facilitated an estimate of the productivity costs associated with the treatment strategies. To assess cost effectiveness, the differences in costs between the strategies were related to the two primary outcome measures in the trial: headache response 2 hours after initial therapy and disability-adjusted time during the first 4 hours after initial therapy.; Although the mean health service cost was higher in the stratified care group (mean over 6 attacks of pound 28.25 versus pound 11.74 and pound 23.15 in the stepped care across attacks group and within attacks group, respectively), mean productivity costs over 6 attacks were lower in the stratified group (pound 112.22 versus pound 144.70 and pound 127.53). The total mean cost over six attacks was, therefore, lowest in the stratified care group (pound 138.95 compared with pound 157.19 in the stepped care across attacks group and pound 148.53 in the stepped care within attacks group), although these differences did not reach statistical significance. In terms of headache response, stratified care was statistically significantly more effective than both forms of stepped care. Using disability-adjusted time, stratified care was statistically significantly more effective than stepped care across attacks, but not against stepped care within attacks.; Given its lower mean costs and higher mean effectiveness, a stratified care strategy, which included zolmitriptan, was the dominant strategy and was unequivocally more cost effective from a societal perspective than either stepped care strategy. When the uncertainty around these means was considered, stratified care had the highest probability of being cost effective.",I,E

The 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are among the most widely prescribed drugs for treating depression and a variety of other disorders including anxiety, social phobia and premenstrual dysphoria (PMD). The other major success stories of 5-HT research are the discovery of 5-HT1B/D receptor agonists for treating migraine and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists for chemotherapy and radiation-induced emesis. The role of 5-HT in the mechanism of action of antipsychotic agents remains a topic of intense research, which promises better treatments for schizophrenia in the future. Compounds interacting with 5-HT1F, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors are currently under investigation and may prove to have important therapeutic applications in the future.",E,E

The use of scintigraphic techniques has established that gastric emptying is abnormally slow in approx. 30-50% of outpatients with long-standing Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, although the magnitude of this delay is modest in many cases. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms occur frequently and affect quality of life adversely in patients with diabetes, although the relationship between symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying is weak. Acute changes in blood glucose concentration affect both gastric motor function and upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastric emptying is slower during hyperglycaemia when compared with euglycaemia and accelerated during hypoglycaemia. The blood glucose concentration may influence the response to prokinetic drugs. Conversely, the rate of gastric emptying is a major determinant of post-prandial glycaemic excursions in healthy subjects, as well as in Type 1 and Type 2 patients. A number of therapies currently in development are designed to improve post-prandial glycaemic control by modulating the rate of delivery of nutrients to the small intestine.",4,E

Dipyridamole co-formulated with aspirin has been shown to increase the relative reduction in risk of second stroke in patients with prior stroke/transient ischaemic attack beyond that obtaining with aspirin alone. We have sought to resolve the question of whether dipyridamole treatment increases the risk of cardiac adverse events in patients with co-existing ischaemic heart disease. The published literature, periodic safety update reports, the randomised controlled trials of antiplatelet agents in stroke prevention and those including dipyridamole in cardiovascular indications, have been reviewed and analysed. The early reports of serious adverse cardiac effect attributable to dipyridamole occurred in patients with severe coronary artery disease using dipyridamole as a stress test adjunct to cardiac imaging. The randomised controlled trials databases show no evidence of mortality and only isolated cases of significant cardiac morbidity attributable to dipyridamole at recommended oral doses in patients with ischaemic heart disease. We conclude that patients with cerebrovascular and mild to moderate concomitant ischaemic heart disease may be treated safely with dipyridamole for the secondary prevention of stroke.",3,E

Secondary end-points included ""headache response"" (defined as headache improvement from ""very severe"", ""severe"" or moderate"" pain to ""mild"" or ""no"" pain) 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after treatment. We also assessed the participant's overall treatment satisfaction at the end of the study. Sumatriptan nasal spray was applied in 154 ""moderate"" to ""very severe"" cluster headache attacks. 30 minutes after nasal spray application, 50% of attacks were completely aborted and 58% of attacks responded to treatment. The overall efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray was considered ""excellent"" in two, ""good"" in four, ""reasonable"" in two and ""poor"" in two patients. Eight patients indicated their intention to treat further attacks with intranasal sumatriptan. Seven patients were interviewed after a follow-up period of six months. Four patients continued to treat all cluster headache attacks with the intranasal sumatriptan formula, two patients had switched to subcutaneous sumatriptan and one patient was in remission since the end of the study. We conclude that 20 mg sumatriptan nasal spray might be an alternative therapy for the treatment of cluster headache attacks, but double-blind studies are needed to further evaluate its efficacy.",3,E

Recent evidence suggests that the primary inflammation occurs in a maxillary nerve segment, accessible intraorally. Local tenderness, related to symptom laterality, has been palpated consistently in asymptomatic migraine patients, and significant migraine relief has been obtained from chilling confined to this area. Thirty-five symptomatic episodic migraine patients were enrolled in this study, comparing 40 minutes of bilateral intraoral chilling, 50 mg of oral sumatriptan, and 40 minutes of sham (tongue) chilling. Hollow metal tubes chilled by circulating ice water were held in the maxillary molar periapical areas by the patient. Pain and nausea were recorded at baseline and 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours after start of treatment, using a numeric symptom-relief scale. Significant mean headache relief was obtained by maxillary chilling and sumatriptan at all four time intervals, with poor relief obtained by placebo. Maxillary chilling was more effective than sumatriptan at all four time intervals. Significant nausea relief was obtained by maxillary chilling and sumatriptan at posttreatment and 2 and 4 hours later. At 24 hours, some headache and nausea recurrence was noted with sumatriptan. The repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated that both treatments, drug (P = 0.024) and maxillary chilling (P = 0.001), reduced the headache, as compared with the control group. Tenderness suggests local inflammation associated with vasodilatation and edema. Because chilling can resolve local edema, these findings raise the possibility that an intraoral inflammation may be a factor in migraine etiology.",I,E

12005277,New paradigms in the recognition and acute treatment of migraine.,Disability Evaluation; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires,"Sheftell, Fred D; Tepper, Stewart J","It would be ideal if clinical decisions regarding acute migraine treatment could be made on the basis of three parameters: a critical appraisal of available scientific evidence, clinical experience (including knowledge of the individual patient and his/her attack characteristics), and, of course, patient preferences. Patients are likely to prefer agents that offer rapid relief, pain-free status within 2 hours, no recurrence or need for rescue medication, extended time to recurrence (if present), consistency of therapeutic effect over multiple attacks, oral administration. good tolerability, safety, and minimal drug interactions. Fortunately, a number of specific therapies now are available which place these objectives within the patient's reach. Ongoing barriers to optimal migraine care include underrecognition, underconsultation, undertreatment, restrictions imposed by insurance companies, and exaggerated concerns regarding the safety of the triptans. Overcoming these barriers is likely to prove a more important contribution to patient care than endeavoring to establish the relative merits of one triptan over another. We have described in detail a number of strategies for improving recognition and treatment of migraine. Many headache specialists now believe that recurrent episodes of disabling headache, with a stable pattern over years, should be viewed as migraine until proven otherwise. In the end, this may represent the most useful paradigm in the primary care setting, where time is of the essence. Studies to validate this approach are needed. Acute treatment intervention that is based on scientific evidence, clinical experience, and patients' needs and desires will provide better outcomes than those presently obtained. Preliminary evidence favors early intervention with oral triptans, and randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, ideally employing a crossover design, are required to confirm this. The US Consortium's evidence-based guidelines, the National Headache Foundation's standards of care, and the Canadian guidelines have applied the standards of scientific inquiry to the field of headache management and ""translation"" of these guidelines into practical instruments for clinicians through vehicles such as the Primary Care Network's Patient-Centered Strategies for Effective Management of Migraine should raise the general standard of care for patients with migraine. Last, but far from least, initiatives undertaken by the World Health Organization (WHO) will add credibility to the many layfolk and professionals who have struggled to present headache as a disabling disorder worthy of scientific investigation and aggressive medical management. The WHO states: ""These common complaints impose a significant health burden ... Despite this, both the public and the majority of healthcare professionals tend to perceive headache as a minor or trivial complaint. As a result, the physical, emotional, social and economic burdens of headache are poorly acknowledged in comparison with those of other, less prevalent, neurologic disorders.""

In diaries, patients recorded baseline pain intensity and the number of triptan tablets and additional medication taken per attack. Patients treated a maximum of three attacks. Analysis of variance or the Student t test and chi-square or Fisher exact tests were used for univariate comparisons. Hochberg corrections were used for multiple-group comparisons. A generalized estimating equation method was used to correct for within-subject correlation. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.; Two hundred thirty-one patients (84% women) treated 589 evaluable migraine attacks (sumatriptan, n = 135; naratriptan, n = 90; zolmitriptan, n = 149; rizatriptan, n = 149). Triptan tablet consumption per attack (mean +/- SD) for rizatriptan (1.24 +/- 0.56) was significantly lower than that of sumatriptan (1.75 +/- 1.2; P< .05), zolmitriptan (1.61 +/- 0.86; P < .05), or naratriptan (1.46 +/- 0.62; P= .05). The average number of triptan tablets taken and additional medication use increased according to baseline pain severity. More attacks were treated with one tablet of rizatriptan (81.2%) than with one tablet of sumatriptan (51.9%), zolmitriptan (55.7%), or naratriptan (60%). The probability of using more than one triptan tablet per attack (24 hours) was more than three times greater for sumatriptan (adjusted OR = 3.71; CI, 2.05 to 6.7; P = .001) and zolmitriptan (adjusted OR = 3.32; CI, 1.82 to 6.17; P = .001), and more than two times greater for naratriptan (adjusted OR = 2.66; CI, 1.36 to 5.21; P =.004) than for rizatriptan.; Rizatriptan was associated with significantly lower triptan tablet use and additional medication use per attack than the other triptans. Additional randomized studies are needed to confirm the conclusions of this study.",E,E

A review of data from placebo-controlled clinical trials.,Humans; Indoles; Migraine Disorders; Placebos; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence; Serotonin Receptor Agonists; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Tryptamines,"Dahl枚f, Carl G H; Dodick, David; Dowson, Andrew J; Pascual, Julio","Almotriptan, the new selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist, has a higher oral bioavailability than any other triptan, with more than two thirds of the administered dose absorbed within the first hour both inside and outside of a migraine attack. Gender or the presence of food in the stomach does not affect its pharmacokinetic profile, and the compound has no clinically relevant interactions with other drugs. Among the available triptans, response rates at 2 hours range from 50% to 80%, with 20% to 50% of patients pain-free. Almotriptan 12.5 mg provides similar efficacy, with significant advantage over placebo at 30 minutes and a reliable consistency (75% in two of three attacks). Headache typically recurs in 25% to 45% of patients with most triptans. The recurrence rate with almotriptan 12.5 mg, 18% to 27%, is among the lowest reported. The tolerability of almotriptan 12.5 mg is close to that of placebo with a low incidence of central nervous system side effects and chest symptoms. In conclusion, almotriptan's consistent pharmacokinetics and good efficacy, in combination with excellent tolerability, make it an attractive choice in the acute treatment of migraine attacks.",I,E

Healthy males received single oral doses of 10 to 120 mg. Following screening and baseline measurements, plasma and saliva eletriptan concentrations were measured at intervals over 48 hours and 24 hours, respectively. Samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Both the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma eletriptan concentration-time curve showed an essentially linear relationship to the administered dose. Eletriptan exhibited a median time to maximum plasma concentration of 1 to 1.25 hours and a mean elimination half-life of 3.6 to 7.0 hours. Mean salivary-plasma ratios for pharmacokinetic parameters generally remained constant across the 30 to 90 mg dose range. Eletriptan was well tolerated, with mostly mild and transient adverse events.

Fifty-five males received oral (1.5-30 mg or 30-120 mg) or intravenous (1.67-50 microg/kg or 50-102 microg/kg) eletriptan in four double- and single-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose crossover studies. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration curve (AUC) appeared linear over all dose ranges, with an apparent terminal half-life of 4 to 5 hours. Clearance and volume of distribution remained constant with dose. The time to first occurrence of Cmax (tmax) for oral eletriptan was approximately 1 hour and was unaffected by dose. Comparison of AUC values suggested an absolute bioavailability of approximately 50%. A linear PK/PD model, fitted to the data, predicted small, transient elevations in diastolic blood pressure following eletriptan doses > or = 60 mg. These effects were considered unlikely to be clinically significant. Eletriptan was well tolerated, and treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate and transient. These PK properties should result in eletriptan having a rapid onset and sustained duration of action in terms of migraine efficacy.",I,E

Results from controlled clinical trials demonstrate efficacy superior to placebo and an adverse event rate comparable to that with placebo.; The goal of this study was to assess the effect of oral almotriptan on the use of rescue medication in the treatment of acute migraine attacks.; Three Phase II and III, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies of almotriptan used as the basis for regulatory approval of the drug were included in the analysis. Two studies (1 single dose, 1 multiple dose) assessed almotriptan 6.25 mg and 12.5 mg and a third compared almotriptan 12.5 mg and sumatriptan 100 mg. Primary results from all 3 trials were previously published. Rescue medication was permitted if migraine pain had not decreased to mild severity or to no pain at 2 hours after study medication. The primary end point of this analysis was use of rescue medication.; A total of 1777 patients were included in the analysis. Mean patient age ranged from 39.4 to 44.0 years; approximately 87% were women, and >98% were white. Patients were well matched for demographic characteristics. Overall, use of rescue medication was significantly lower with almotriptan 6.25 mg and 12.5 mg compared with placebo (P < or = 0.05 for each group). No significant difference was noted between the almotriptan 12.5-mg and sumatriptan 100-mg groups. In 2 of the studies, patients with moderate or severe baseline pain used significantly less rescue medication in the almotriptan groups compared with placebo.; Oral almotriptan 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg significantly reduced use of rescue medication compared with placebo among patients with acute migraine.

In vitro studies have suggested that sumatriptan is metabolized primarily by the monoamine oxidase-A isozyme and not by CYP3A4.; This study sought to determine the effect of coadministration of clarithromycin dosed to steady state on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of sumatriptan. A secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of combining these agents.; This was an open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study in healthy volunteers. During treatment period 1, subjects received either a single oral dose of sumatriptan 50 mg (sumatriptan alone) or clarithromycin 500 mg orally every 12 hours on days 1 to 3 and a single oral dose of sumatriptan 50 mg plus a single oral dose of clarithromycin 500 mg on the morning of day 4 (combination treatment). During treatment period 2, they received the alternative regimen. Equivalence between sumatriptan alone and combination treatment was concluded if the 90% CI for the ratio of reference to test means of loge-transformed data for area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(infinity)) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) fell within the interval from 0.8 to 1.25.; In the 24 evaluable subjects (12 men, 12 women) included in the pharmacokinetic analysis, mean sumatriptan AUC(infinity) and Cmax values after administration of combination treatment were 9% and 14% higher, respectively, than the corresponding values after administration of sumatriptan alone. The 90% CI for the ratio of reference to test means for AUC(infinity) was 1.03 to 1.15. The 90% CI for the ratio of reference to test means for Cmax was 1.03 to 1.26, above the traditional bioequivalence criterion. All other pharmacokinetic parameters tested, including nonparametric analysis of the time to Cmax, met the criterion for equivalence between treatments. Both treatments were well tolerated in the 27 subjects (13 men, 14 women) included in the safety analysis.; The extent of absorption of sumatriptan was similar after oral administration alone and in combination with clarithromycin dosed to steady state. These data are consistent with previous reports that sumatriptan is unaffected by coadministration with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin, supporting concomitant administration of these agents without the need for dose adjustment of sumatriptan in the acute treatment of migraine.",4,E

The exact pathophysiological disturbances that occur with migraine have yet to be elucidated; however, cervico-trigemino-vascular dysfunctions appear to be the primary cause. Despite advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of migraine and new effective treatment options, migraine remains an under-diagnosed, under-treated and poorly treated health condition. Most patients will unsuccessfully attempt to treat their headaches with over-the-counter medications. Few well designed, placebo-controlled studies are available to guide physicians in medication selection. Recently published evidence-based guidelines advocate migraine-specific drugs, such as serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists (the 'triptans') and dihydroergotamine mesylate, for patients experiencing moderate to severe migraine attacks. Additional headache attack therapy options include other ergotamine derivatives, phenothiazines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and opioids. Preventative medication therapy is indicated for patients experiencing frequent and/or refractory attacks.",E,E

Outcomes sought were headache relief at 1 and 2h, patients pain free at 2h and sustained relief over 24h for treatments compared with placebo. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) were calculated, together with relative benefit. Information on adverse effects was also collected. Comparisons of relative efficacy used the same definition of headache, the same degree of pain at the start of treatment and the same definitions of outcomes, and always compared with placebo. Forty-eight publications reporting on 54 trials were included in the meta-analyses, with 79 placebo comparisons for the primary outcome of headache relief at 2h. Information on any outcome was available for nine oral medications, two intranasal medications and subcutaneous sumatriptan in 21,022 patients.

12054095,Sensitization: its role in primary headache.,Animals; Headache; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Tension-Type Headache,"Bendtsen, Lars","The pathophysiology of the two most common primary headaches, migraine and tension-type headache, is complex and not yet fully understood. Recent animal and human studies examining these headaches indicate that the nociceptive input to the central nervous system (CNS) may be increased due to activation or sensitization of peripheral sensory afferents. The barrage of nociceptive impulses may result in sensitization of second- and third-order neurons in the CNS. In this way, sensitization may play a role in initiation and maintenance of migraine and tension-type headache. It is likely that the effects of established medication for both disorders may be partly due to a reduction in sensitization. Several interesting drugs that counteract sensitization are under development, and targeting this mode of action seems to be a promising way of improving the treatment for these prevalent disorders.",E,E

Its efficacy and tolerability have been assessed in a number of randomised, controlled trials in over 4800 adults with moderate or severe attacks of migraine. Oral almotriptan has a rapid onset of action (significant headache relief is observed 0.5 hours after administration of a 12.5mg dose) and efficacy is sustained in most patients who respond by 2 hours. The drug is significantly more effective than placebo as measured by a number of parameters including 2-hour headache response and pain-free response rates. Other symptoms of migraine, including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, are also alleviated by almotriptan. The efficacy of oral almotriptan appears to be maintained over repeated doses for multiple attacks of migraine treated over a long period (up to 1 year). High headache response rates were reported over all attacks without tachyphylaxis. For the relief of single attacks of migraine, oral almotriptan 12.5mg had similar efficacy to oral sumatriptan 50mg. Patients given almotriptan report less concern with adverse effects than patients given sumatriptan. The lower incidence of chest pain following treatment with almotriptan than with sumatriptan may lead to a reduction in direct costs, with fewer patients requiring management of chest pain. Almotriptan is well tolerated. Most adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity, transient and generally resolved without intervention or the need for treatment withdrawal. The most common adverse events associated with oral almotriptan 12.5mg treatment were dizziness, paraesthesia, nausea, fatigue, headache, somnolence, skeletal pain, vomiting and chest symptoms. The incidence of adverse events did not differ from placebo and decreased in the longer term. Almotriptan can be coadministered with drugs that share a common hepatic metabolic path; in addition, dosage reduction is required only in the presence of severe renal or hepatic impairment.; Almotriptan is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe attacks of migraine in adults. An oral dose of almotriptan 12.5mg has shown greater efficacy than placebo; current data indicate that efficacy is similar to that of oral sumatriptan 50mg, and is maintained in the long term (< or = 1 year). Almotriptan has a good adverse event profile and a generally similar overall tolerability profile to sumatriptan; of note, almotriptan is associated with a significantly lower incidence of chest pain than sumatriptan. However, further clinical experience is required to clearly define the place of almotriptan among the other currently available triptans. Nevertheless, because triptans have an important place in various management regimens, and because the nature of individual patient response to triptans is idiosyncratic, almotriptan is likely to become a useful treatment option in the management of adults with moderate or severe migraine headaches.",I,E

The authors report a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over trial of a dual-release formulation of oral ketoprofen in the acute treatment of migraine attacks.; The authors compared the efficacy of two doses of ketoprofen (75 or 150 mg) with that of placebo (primary analysis) and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (secondary analysis) on one to four consecutive attacks in 235 intent-to-treat patients (out of 257 randomized patients) with migraine with or without aura. The principal efficacy outcome was headache relief (reduction in headache severity from severe or moderate to mild or absent at 2 hours).; Results are based on 838 attacks with a severe or moderate headache that were evaluable at 2 hours. Relief was reported for 62.6% of headaches treated with ketoprofen 75 mg, 61.6% with ketoprofen 150 mg, and 66.8% with zolmitriptan. The difference between the three active treatments and placebo (27.8% relief) was highly significant, both tests of ketoprofen vs placebo being globally controlled at a 5% level for the type I error (primary analysis). Headaches at 2 hours disappeared more frequently for the active treatments than for placebo. The authors also demonstrated efficacy on most other secondary outcomes. The tolerance of ketoprofen was good (similar to that of placebo).; Oral ketoprofen (75 mg or 150 mg) in a dual-release formulation is an effective and well-tolerated drug in the acute treatment of migraine attacks.",3,E

Events are reviewed by a physician and a relationship is established between each event and the drug. The events are then sorted into reactions and incidents. The latter are used to assist signal detection and control for bias. Rates for reports, reactions and incidents are used to assess the adequacy of reporting, signal detection and identification of confounders. Most signals are identified by clinical evaluation of the reports at a stage when statistical analyses are unlikely to have the power to detect them with confidence. The incident group is used for signal detection and controlling for bias. A low reporting rate indicates that certain types of event are unlikely to be reported. A systematic review of the original case reports at the site of collection provides the best opportunity for early signal detection. More resources need to be invested in the training and support of clinical evaluators. Categorising events into reactions and incidents gives added value to the data. Rates of reporting should be quoted with the results of cohort studies to facilitate assessment of their power to detect new signals.",E,E

Randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in patients with migraine have shown that zolmitriptan has good efficacy measured using 2 h response and pain-free rates. Migraine-associated symptoms, including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, are also improved with zolmitriptan. Oral zolmitriptan (2.5 and 5 mg) has an onset of action within 45 min and efficacy is sustained in most patients who respond at 2 h. The orally-disintegrating zolmitriptan tablet has the advantage that it may be taken immediately, without the need for additional fluids, any time a migraine headache occurs. Patients may benefit in terms of improved efficacy from the convenience of the disintegrating tablet, since there is evidence that taking triptan therapy as early as possible in an attack is advantageous. For similar reasons, as well as improved efficacy, a nasal spray formulation is in development. Zolmitriptan is effective in the treatment of migraine associated with menses and migraine with aura. There is no tachyphylaxis following repeated doses for multiple attacks of migraine over a prolonged period of time. Compared to placebo, the incidence of persistent migraine headache is reduced by zolmitriptan and recurrent migraine headache occurs less frequently. Zolmitriptan has also shown efficacy in the treatment of persistent and/or recurrent migraine headache. Comparative clinical studies have shown overall that zolmitriptan has similar or superior efficacy to sumatriptan in the treatment of migraine. Specifically, zolmitriptan 2.5 mg was significantly more effective than sumatriptan 25 or 50 mg according to a number of end points, including headache response at 2 h. Oral zolmitriptan is also effective in the acute treatment of cluster headache. Zolmitriptan is generally well tolerated, with most adverse events being mild-to-moderate, transient and resolving without intervention or the need for treatment withdrawal. The consistent efficacy in treating all types of migraine and the choice of available formulations make zolmitriptan acceptable to patients and a suitable first-line therapy for the treatment of migraine.",I,E

Earlier clinical trials demonstrated that rizatriptan 5 or 10mg is more effective than placebo at providing pain relief and a pain-free state, relieving associated symptoms of migraine, normalising functional ability and improving patient quality of life, and showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recently, rizatriptan 10mg was shown to be more effective than zolmitriptan 2.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg at producing a pain-free state 2 hours postdose. Furthermore, compared with naratriptan, significantly more patients who received rizatriptan were pain free or had pain relief from 1 hour onwards. The number of patients with normal functional ability at 2 hours was significantly higher after rizatriptan than after naratriptan or zolmitriptan. Rizatriptan was also generally more effective than zolmitriptan or naratriptan at relieving migraine-associated symptoms. Rizatriptan is generally well tolerated and adverse events are usually mild and transient. The most common adverse events associated with rizatriptan in recent randomised trials were asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and nausea. There was a trend towards a lower incidence of adverse events with rizatriptan compared with zolmitriptan (31.2 vs 38.8%). However, rizatriptan was associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse events than naratriptan (39 vs 29%). The incidence of chest pain was similar after the administration of rizatriptan, zolmitriptan or naratriptan (2 to 4%).; Rizatriptan is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine. Oral rizatriptan 5 and 10mg have shown greater efficacy than placebo in providing pain relief, an absence of pain, relief from associated symptoms, normal functional ability and an improvement in patient quality of life. Earlier results showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recent studies have shown that rizatriptan 10mg provides faster pain relief and a higher percentage of patients with an absence of pain and normal functional ability at 2 hours than naratriptan 2.5mg or zolmitriptan 2.5mg. The efficacy of rizatriptan is retained when used in the long term and the drug is generally well tolerated. Although well designed studies comparing rizatriptan with almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan would further define the position of rizatriptan, current data suggest rizatriptan should be considered as a first-line treatment option in the management of migraine.",E,E

Under certain circumstances, these two agents may be administered closely in time. However, the possibility of a pharmacokinetic interaction and the safety of this regime have not been examined. In this crossover design study, 24 healthy subjects received the following four treatments, each separated by at least 7 days: 1 mg butorphanol (Stadol NS7); 20 mg sumatriptan (Imitrex Nasal Spray); or both formulations together with butorphanol administered either 1 or 30 min after sumatriptan. Serial plasma samples were collected for 24 h post-dose and analysed for butorphanol and/or sumatriptan by HPLC-MS/MS. Butorphanol plasma concentrations were reduced when it was administered 1 min (mean 28.6% decrease in AUC(0-infinity)), but not 30 min, after sumatriptan. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan were not substantially altered by butorphanol. The combination of nasally administered sumatriptan and butorphanol appeared safe. However, if butorphanol nasal spray is administered <30 min after sumatriptan nasal spray, the analgesic effect of butorphanol may be diminished due to reduced nasal absorption resulting from probable transient vasoconstriction of nasal blood vessels by sumatriptan.",4,E

As with any other acute treatment for migraine, headache recurrence may occur in up to one-third of responders. Combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to reduce the incidence of headache recurrence in clinical practice. Rofecoxib is a member of a new class of NSAIDs, which selectively inhibits the COX-2 enzyme and therefore is associated with a lower risk of gastrointestinal side-effects; the drug has a long plasma half-life (17 h). This open label study compared rizatriptan with rizatriptan plus rofecoxib in the acute treatment of migraine. Fifty-six triptan naive patients from a tertiary centre (37 women and 19 men, ages 16-55 years, mean 35 years) with International Headache Society migraine were randomized into two groups. They were instructed to treat three consecutive moderate or severe attacks with either 10 mg rizatriptan (group 1: 18 women and 10 men) or with 10 mg rizatriptan plus 25 mg rofecoxib (group 2: 19 women and 9 men). The presence of headache and nausea at 1, 2 and 4 h, and of side-effects, use of rescue medication and recurrence were compared. Fifty-four patients completed the study. Group 1 treated 76 attacks and group 2 treated 81 attacks. Absence of headache at 1 h was seen in 19 attacks (25%) in group 1 and in 34 attacks (42%) in group 2 (P=0.082); at 2 h absence of headache was seen in 60% of group 1 attacks and in 76% of group 2 attacks (P=0.115). At 4 h, 75% of group 1 attacks and 88% of group 2 attacks were pain free (P=0.122). With regard to nausea, of those who had nausea at baseline, 31% and 49% of attacks in groups 1 and 2, respectively, were nausea free at 1 h (P=0.091), 75% and 79% at 2 h (P=0.736) and 82% and 91% (P=0.479) at 4 h. Recurrence, based on all attacks of those patients who achieved pain free at 4 h, was observed in 53% of group 1 and 20% of group 2 attacks (P<0.001). Sustained pain-free rates (for the 4-h time point) were 45.6% of group 1 and 78.9% of group 2 attacks. There were no significant differences with regard to rescue medication consumption after 4 h and side-effects in both groups. There was a non-significant trend for the combination group to have a higher response rate. The group treated with rizatriptan and rofecoxib had a lower recurrence rate than the group treated with rizatriptan. This study demonstrated that combining a fast acting triptan such as rizatriptan with rofecoxib reduced headache recurrence rates, was well tolerated and may be more effective than the use of rizatriptan alone. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are necessary to confirm these observations.",6,E

This has lead to a number of significant advances including 5HT3 antagonists for the treatment of functional diarrhoea, 5HT4 agonists for the treatment of constipation and 5HT1 agonists for the treatment of impaired fundal relaxation. Initial enthusiasm has been somewhat dented by the withdrawal of alosetron because of ischaemic colitis, but it remains to be seen whether this adverse event will be seen with other 5HT3 antagonists. Finally it should be recognized that, in a substantial proportion of patients attending clinics complaining of functional symptoms, anxiety is a major component. The drugs so far described are by and large devoid of CNS effects. It remains possible therefore that a drug which combines both peripheral and central effects would likely to be beneficial.",4,E

These actions include the release of vasoactive neuropeptides by the trigeminovascular system, vasodilation of intracranial extracerebral vessels, and increased nociceptive neurotransmission within the central trigeminocervical complex. The 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists, collectively known as triptans, are a major advance in the treatment of migraine. The beneficial effects of the triptans in patients with migraine are related to their multiple mechanisms of action at sites implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. These mechanisms are mediated by 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors and include vasoconstriction of painfully dilated cerebral blood vessels, inhibition of the release of vasoactive neuropeptides by trigeminal nerves, and inhibition of nociceptive neurotransmission. The high affinity of the triptans for 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors and their favorable pharmacologic properties contribute to the beneficial effects of these drugs, including rapid onset of action, effective relief of headache and associated symptoms, and low incidence of adverse effects.",E,E

This may lead to erratic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and make oral treatment unsatisfactory. For such patients, an intranasal formulation may be advantageous. Sumatriptan is a potent serotonin 5HT(1B/1D) agonist widely used in the treatment of migraine; the effectiveness of the intranasal formulation (20mg) has been well established in several clinical studies. This article reviews the pharmacokinetics of intranasal sumatriptan and includes comparisons with oral and subcutaneous administration. After intranasal administration, sumatriptan is directly and rapidly absorbed, with 60% of the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) occurring at 30 minutes after administration of a single 20mg dose. Following intranasal administration, approximately 10% more sumatriptan is absorbed probably via the nasal mucosa when compared with oral administration. Mean C(max) after a 20mg intranasal dose is approximately 13.1 to 14.4 ng/mL, with median time to C(max) approximately 1 to 1.75 hours. When given as a single dose, intranasal sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption and C(max) over the dose range 5 to 10mg, but not between 5 and 20mg for C(max). The elimination phase half-life is approximately 2 hours, consistent with administration by other routes. Sumatriptan is metabolised by monoamine oxidase (MAO; predominantly the A isozyme, MAO-A) to an inactive metabolite. Coadministration with a MAO-A inhibitor, moclobemide, leads to a significant increase in sumatriptan plasma concentrations and is contraindicated. Single-dose pharmacokinetics in paediatric and adolescent patients following intranasal sumatriptan were studied to determine the effect of changes in nasal morphology during growth, and of body size, on pharmacokinetic parameters. The pharmacokinetic profile observed in adults was maintained in the adolescent population; generally, factors such as age, bodyweight or height did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics. In children below 12 years, C(max) is comparable to that seen in adolescents and adults, but total exposure (area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity) was lower in children compared with older patients, especially in younger children treated with 5mg. Clinical experience suggests that intranasal sumatriptan has some advantages over the tablet (more rapid onset of effect and use in patients with gastrointestinal complaints) or subcutaneous (noninvasive and fewer adverse events) formulations.",3,E

The Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) questionnaire was used to assess the impact of migraine on work, home and social lives. In phase II, 516 patients with clinically diagnosed migraine were interviewed to assess the impact of migraine on daily life, attitudes towards migraine, perceptions of current treatments and aspirations for future treatments.; In phase I, the average prevalence of migraine over the five countries was 9%. Migraine posed a significant burden in terms of the impact on patients' daily lives, and attack severity and frequency. However, medical consultation rates were low; reasons for this included patients not recognising that they had migraine or having low expectations about treatment benefits. On average, only 10% of patients who had consulted a physician had been prescribed a triptan. Only 22% of participants in phase II thought that migraine did not markedly affect their lives. In each of the five countries, > or = 50% of patients required bed rest to manage migraine attacks, demonstrating the impact of migraine-related disability on patients' lives. Assessment of MIDAS scores confirmed the debilitating effect of migraine; > 50% of respondents had a MIDAS grade of III or IV, indicating moderate or severe disability. Less than one-third of patients reported that their current medication was consistently effective and only 36% were 'very satisfied' with their current therapy. High efficacy and rapid pain relief were rated as the most important attributes of migraine medications. When asked which formulation they would like to see more of, most patients chose a tablet that dissolves in the mouth without the need to take liquids.; These results show that migraine patients worldwide are still not receiving adequate treatment and there remains a significant unmet need in migraine care. The challenge for the future is to diagnose migraine early and offer patients effective migraine-specific therapies. Physicians particularly need to reach patients who do not realise they have migraine and those who have lapsed from care.",E,E

The initial clinical file failed to show that selegiline had any benefit in these indications. (3) Now, in 2002, new data from trials involving hundreds of untreated patients show that selegiline postpones the need for levodopa therapy for a few months but fails to substantially alter the progression of Parkinson's disease. (4) A clinical trial and a retrospective epidemiological study of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease showed excess mortality on selegiline. (5) The side effects of selegiline are similar to those of other antiparkinsonian drugs and amphetamine. Notable side effects include cardiovascular problems (postural hypotension, atrial fibrillation and arterial hypertension). (6) Selegiline can cause a serotoninergic syndrome and arterial hypertension, so must not be combined with pethidine, tramadol, bupropion, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan or naratriptan. Concurrent treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants should also be avoided. (7) Given the only moderate effects of selegiline in Parkinson's disease, and the possibility of a slight increase in mortality, there is no justification for prescribing this medication in patients with Parkinson's disease. (8) Whatever the stage of Parkinson's disease, there is no justification for starting patients on selegiline. Patients who are already taking selegiline should only continue to take it if they feel a clear benefit and are free from risk factors for early mortality, especially cardiovascular disease.",4,E

Earlier clinical trials demonstrated that rizatriptan 5 or 10mg is more effective than placebo at providing pain relief and a pain-free state, relieving associated symptoms of migraine, normalising functional ability and improving patient quality of life, and showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recently, rizatriptan 10mg was shown to be more effective than zolmitriptan 2.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg at producing a pain-free state 2 hours postdose. Furthermore, compared with naratriptan, significantly more patients who received rizatriptan were pain free or had pain relief from 1 hour onwards. The number of patients with normal functional ability at 2 hours was significantly higher after rizatriptan than after naratriptan or zolmitriptan. Rizatriptan was also generally more effective than zolmitriptan or naratriptan at relieving migraine-associated symptoms. Rizatriptan is generally well tolerated, and adverse events are usually mild and transient. The most common adverse events associated with rizatriptan in recent randomised trials were asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and nausea. There was a trend towards a lower incidence of adverse events with rizatriptan compared with zolmitriptan (31.2 vs 38.8%). However, rizatriptan was associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse events than naratriptan (39 vs 29%). The incidence of chest pain was similar after the administration of rizatriptan, zolmitriptan or naratriptan (2-4%). In conclusion, rizatriptan is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine. Oral rizatriptan 5 and 10mg have shown greater efficacy than placebo in providing pain relief, an absence of pain, relief from associated symptoms, normal functional ability and an improvement in patient quality of life. Earlier results showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recent studies have shown that rizatriptan 10mg provides faster pain relief and a higher percentage of patients with an absence of pain and normal functional ability at 2 hours than naratriptan 2.5mg or zolmitriptan 2.5mg. The efficacy of rizatriptan is retained when used in the long term, and the drug is generally well tolerated. Although well designed studies comparing rizatriptan with almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan would further define the position of rizatriptan, current data suggest that rizatriptan should be considered as a first-line treatment option in the management of migraine.",I,E

Almotriptan was effective in animal models predictive of anti-migraine activity in humans and had a good safety profile in animal studies. From the toxicological point of view, almotriptan has a profile similar to that of other marketed triptans. In animal studies, at levels substantially higher than required for therapeutic activity in humans, almotriptan was devoid of any oncogenic, genotoxic or teratogenic effects. Almotriptan is well absorbed orally; its absolute bioavailability in humans is 70%. Its peak plasma levels are reached at 1 to 3 h after its administration; its elimination half-life is 3 to 4 h. Almotriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase-mediated oxidative deamination and cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation as the major metabolic route and by flavin monooxygenase as the minor route. No dose adjustment is required for gender or age, and only in the case of severe renal impairment the dose should not exceed 12.5 mg over a 24-h period. There was no significant interaction between a single dose of almotriptan and propranolol, fluoxetine or verapamil, at multiple doses. The efficacy of almotriptan in the treatment of acute migraine was demonstrated in clinical trials on more than 3000 patients with migraine. At two h after oral administration of almotriptan, 12.5 mg, the percentages of patients showing pain relief and a pain-free score were 64 and 36%, respectively. The effects of almotriptan were significantly better than those of placebo. When almotriptan was administered in the early phase of migraine, the percentage of pain-free patients at 2 h rose to 84%. In a phase III, double-blind and placebo-controlled study, the incidence of adverse events with almotriptan was not statistically different from that of placebo. Based on the available data, it appears that almotriptan is the triptan of choice when good efficacy and high tolerability are desired.",I,I

In order to evaluate the potential role of statins as immunomodulators in MS, the authors studied their immunologic effects in vitro and compared them to interferon (IFN)beta-1b.; Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from untreated or IFN beta-1-treated patients with relapsing-remitting MS or from healthy donors (HD) and T cells were stimulated with concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, or antibody to CD3 in the presence of lovastatin, simvastatin, mevastatin, IFN beta-1b, or statins plus IFN beta-1b. The authors analyzed proliferative activity of T cells and B cells, cytokine production and release, activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and surface expression of activation markers, adhesion molecules, and chemokine receptors on both T and B cells.; All three statins inhibited proliferation of stimulated PBMC in a dose-dependent manner, with simvastatin being the most potent, followed by lovastatin and mevastatin. IFN beta-1b showed a similar effect; statins and IFN beta-1b together added their inhibitory potentials. Furthermore, statins reduced the expression of activation-induced adhesion molecules on T cells, modified the T helper 1/T helper 2 cytokine balance, reduced MMP-9, and downregulated chemokine receptors on both B and T cells. Besides strong anti-inflammatory properties, statins also exhibited some proinflammatory effects.; Statins are effective immunomodulators in vitro that merit evaluation as treatment for MS.",3,E

Assessments of treatment efficacy have tended to focus on migraine symptoms, rather than looking at functional impact. This study compared the efficacy of different oral triptans for restoring normal function in migraine sufferers.; Retrospective subgroup analysis of data from five randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials in which oral rizatriptan was directly compared with oral sumatriptan 100 mg (772 attacks), 50 mg (2,227 attacks), and 25 mg (1,182 attacks), naratriptan 2.5 mg (413 attacks), and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (578 attacks) for the acute treatment of a moderate or severe migraine attack. Functional disability was evaluated by patients on a 4-grade scale ('normal', 'mild impairment', 'severe impairment', 'requires bedrest') at baseline and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 h after dosing. This analysis looked at the percentage of patients who had normal functional ability at 2 h, the last time point before escape medications were allowed, in the subgroup of patients who had some level of disability at baseline.; Most patients in each trial and treatment group had some level of disability at baseline (range = 94-100%). At 2 h, more patients on rizatriptan 10 mg were able to function normally compared with sumatriptan 100 mg (39 vs. 32%, odds ratio = 1.4, p = 0.021), sumatriptan 50 mg (47 vs. 42%, odds ratio = 1.2, p = 0.033), sumatriptan 25 mg (48 vs. 36%, odds ratio = 1.7, p < 0.001), naratriptan 2.5 mg (39 vs. 22%, odds ratio = 2.5, p < 0.001), and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (45 vs. 36%, odds ratio = 1.6, p = 0.008).; In direct head-to-head comparative clinical trials, oral rizatriptan 10 mg enabled more migraine sufferers to function normally at 2 h after dosing than oral sumatriptan, naratriptan, and zolmitriptan.",I,I

Soon, seven different triptans will be clinically available at 13 different oral doses, making evidence-based selection guidelines necessary. Triptan trials have similar designs, facilitating meta-analysis. We wished to provide an evidence-based foundation for using triptans in clinical practice, and to review the methodological issues surrounding triptan trials. We asked pharmaceutical companies and the principal investigators of company-independent trials for the 'raw patient data' of all double-blind, randomized, controlled, clinical trials with oral triptans in migraine. All data were cross-checked with published or presented data. We calculated summary estimates across studies for important efficacy and tolerability parameters, and compared these with those from direct, head-to-head, comparator trials. Out of 76 eligible clinical trials, 53 (12 not yet published) involving 24089 patients met the criteria for inclusion. Mean results (and 95% confidence intervals) for sumatriptan 100 mg, the first available and most widely prescribed oral triptan, are 59% (57-60) for 2 h headache response (improvement from moderate or severe to mild or no pain); 29% (27-30) for 2 h pain free (improvement to no pain); 20% (18-21) for sustained pain free (pain free by 2 h and no headache recurrence or use of rescue medication 2-24 h post-dose), and 67% (63-70) for consistency (response in at least two out of three treated attacks); placebo-subtracted proportions for patients with at least one adverse event (AE) are 13% (8-18), for at least one central nervous system AE 6% (3-9), and for at least one chest AE 1.9% (1.0-2.7). Compared with these data: rizatriptan 10 mg shows better efficacy and consistency, and similar tolerability; eletriptan 80 mg shows better efficacy, similar consistency, but lower tolerability; almotriptan 12.5 mg shows similar efficacy at 2 h but better sustained pain-free response, consistency, and tolerability; sumatriptan 25 mg, naratriptan 2.5 mg and eletriptan 20 mg show lower efficacy and better tolerability; zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 5 mg, eletriptan 40 mg, and rizatriptan 5 mg show very similar results. The results of the 22 trials that directly compared triptans show the same overall pattern. We received no data on frovatriptan, but publicly available data suggest substantially lower efficacy. The major methodological issues involve the choice of the primary endpoint, consistency over multiple attacks, how to evaluate headache recurrence, use of placebo-subtracted proportions to control for across-study differences, and the difference between tolerability and safety. In addition, there are a number of methodological issues specific for direct comparator trials, including encapsulation and patient selection. At marketed doses, all oral triptans are effective and well tolerated. Differences among them are in general relatively small, but clinically relevant for individual patients. Rizatriptan 10 mg, eletriptan 80 mg and almotriptan 12.5 mg provide the highest likelihood of consistent success. Sumatriptan features the longest clinical experience and the widest range of formulations. All triptans are contra-indicated in the presence of cardiovascular disease.",E,E

Patients used a diary card to record details of each migraine attack and onset of menstruation. Attacks in women were classified as menstrual or nonmenstrual according to 3 time windows relative to onset of menstruation (day 0): -3 to +3 days (7-day window), -2 to + 2 days (5-day window), and 0 to +1 days (2-day window). The analysis looked at the efficacy of rizatriptan 10 mg by menstrual category of attack for each definition on three measures: pain relief at 2 hours (reduction of pain to mild or none), pain free at 2 hours, 24-hours sustained pain free (pain free at 2 hours with no headache recurrence and no use of additional medications from 2 to 24 hours).; Ninety-five women used rizatriptan 10 mg to treat a total of 1,839 attacks. The percentage of menstrual attacks was 30% for the -3 to +3 days definition, 23% for the -2 to +2 days definition, and 11% for the 0 to +1 days definition. Rizatriptan 10 mg was equally effective in menstrual and nonmenstrual migraine attacks regardless of the definition used. For example, using the -3 to +3 days definition, 78% of menstrual migraine attacks were relieved at 2 hours after dosing compared with 78% of nonmenstrual attacks. Pain relief rates for the other definitions were as follows: -2 to +2 days, menstrual = 78%, nonmenstrual = 78%; 0 to +1 days, menstrual = 79%, and nonmenstrual = 78%. No differences between menstrual and nonmenstrual attacks were found for the 2-hour pain free and 24-hour sustained pain free measures for any of the three definitions.; Rizatriptan 10-mg wafers were equally effective in the treatment of menstrual and nonmenstrual migraine attacks occurring over 6 months, regardless of the precise definition of menstrual association used and even when the outcome criteria were very stringent.

The effects of migraine, self-reported by Canadians, on health care resource use as well as paid and unpaid work loss were examined.; The Migraine Background Questionnaire (MBQ) was self-administered during the screening visit of a phase III clinical trial of rizatriptan (a potent, selective 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B/1D)-receptor agonist or 'triptan'). Patients suffering from moderate to severe migraine in the previous six months were offered the opportunity to participate. Migraine frequency was determined and costs were estimated and assigned based on known direct costs of health care resource utilization, and indirect costs of paid and unpaid work and productivity loss.; One hundred thirty-four patients completed the MBQ. In the previous year, 89% of those patients reported visiting a clinic, 23% reported visiting an emergency room and 5% reported being hospitalized for migraine. Patients reported an average of 6.5 days absent from work, 44 days working with migraine headache and 10.4 reduced workday equivalents due to ineffectiveness at work with migraine. Based on data obtained from the Ontario, the average overall annual cost due to migraine was estimated to be 3,025 dollars/patient; most of this (87%) due to indirect costs.; In Canada, patients with moderate to severe migraine, as identified in a phase III clinical trial, reported lost work days and reduced effectiveness while at work, as well as increased health care resource utilization due to migraine.

Two measures of cost-effectiveness were used: cost per headache prevented and the cost-equivalent number.; In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials evaluated, three antiepileptic drugs were shown to be effective in migraine prevention. All three antiepileptic drugs had high costs per migraine reduced. Gabapentin was the most costly at dollars 138.00 per migraine prevented, whereas the cost per migraine prevented with topiramate was US dollars 114.80 and with divalproex sodium was US dollars 48.00. For migraine prevention divalproex sodium became cost-effective with 10 migraines per month, whereas gabapentin and topiramate required considerably more migraines per month to be cost-effective.; Antiepileptic drugs have proven effectiveness in migraine prophylaxis. However, in patients responsive to their acute care medications, the antiepileptic drugs are only cost-effective for those patients with a high frequency of migraines and those with comorbid diseases. Future studies should be done with antiepileptic drugs in patients exhibiting a migraine frequency of 10 or more headaches per month.",3,E

Migraine is a common disorder with a serious impact on quality of life. Newer serotonin-receptor agonists have been developed with the aim of improving pharmacokinetic characteristics. Almotriptan, a selective agonist of serotonin receptors 1B and 1D, carries FDA-approved labeling for use in the management of migraine with or without aura in adults. The efficacy and receptor affinity resemble those of sumatriptan, but almotriptan has a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile. It has a rapid onset of action, an oral bioavailability of 70-80%, and a longer half-life than sumatriptan. In clinical trials, almotriptan has been significantly more effective than placebo and as effective as sumatriptan. However, it has been associated with better tolerability and greater patient satisfaction. In clinical trials, the most commonly reported adverse effects were nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, vomiting, and paresthesia. Almotriptan is contraindicated in patients with known ischemic heart disease, coronary vasospasm, and other significant cardiovascular disorders. Almotriptan has a lower acquisition cost than other triptans and possibly lower overall health care costs because of a lower frequency of cardiovascular adverse effects. The recommended dose of almotriptan is one 6.25- or 12.5-mg tablet given at the onset of symptoms. Almotriptan is effective for the management of migraine and offers the potential for fewer adverse effects than other agents in its class.",I,E

(3 mg), subcutaneous (s.c.) (6 mg), and oral (25 mg) doses. Volunteers received each dose in a randomized sequence separated by a 7-day washout. Blood and urine samples for pharmacokinetic evaluations were taken for up to 24 hours after dosing. The disposition kinetics of almotriptan after i.v. and s.c. administration showed biphasic decline described by a two-compartment model. The fastest disposition phase was well observed, although estimates of the rate constant showed high variability. After s.c. administration of almotriptan, the bioavailability was 100% with a time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of 5 to 15 minutes, whereas after oral administration, the bioavailability was about 70% with a tmax of 1.5 to 3.0 hours. No significant differences were observed between administration routes in the elimination half-life (t(1/2), obtaining mean values ranging from 3.4 to 3.6 hours. The volume of distribution, total clearance, and t(1/2) indicated that almotriptan was extensively distributed and rapidly cleared from the body irrespective of dose or route of administration. The primary route of elimination was renal clearance (approximately 50%-60% of total body clearance). About 65% of the i.v. and s.c. dose and 45% of the oral dose were excreted unchanged in urine in 24 hours, with nearly 90% of this in the first 12 hours. Renal clearance was approximately 2- to 3-fold that of the glomerular filtration rate in man, suggesting that almotriptan is eliminated in part by renal tubular secretion.",4,E

This randomized double- blind crossover outpatient study assessed the preference for 1 rizatriptan 10 mg tablet to 2 ergotamine 1 mg/caffeine 100 mg tablets in 439 patients treating a single migraine attack with each therapy. Of patients expressing a preference (89.1%), more than twice as many preferred rizatriptan to ergotamine/caffeine (69.9 vs. 30.1%, p < or = 0.001). Faster relief of headache was the most important reason for preference, cited by 67.3% of patients preferring rizatriptan and 54.2% of patients who preferred ergotamine/caffeine. The co-primary endpoint of being pain free at 2 h was also in favor of rizatriptan. Forty-nine percent of patients were pain free 2 h after rizatriptan, compared with 24.3% treated with ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001), rizatriptan being superior within 1 h of treatment. Headache relief at 2 h was 75.9% for rizatriptan and 47.3% for ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001), with rizatriptan being superior to ergotamine/caffeine within 30 min of dosing. Almost 36% of patients taking rizatriptan were pain free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication within 24 h, compared to 20% of patients on ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001). Rizatriptan was also superior to ergotamine/caffeine in the proportions of patients with no nausea, vomiting, phonophobia or photophobia and for patients with normal function 2 h after drug intake (p < or = 0.001).

Scrutiny of these agents in an effort to detect any signal of teratogenicity is thus important. A systematic review of the medical literature was conducted to identify information regarding the safety of sumatriptan during pregnancy. This agent was chosen to be investigated because it has been available for the longest and is the most widely used of the triptan class. Information was obtained regarding the impact of migraine on pregnancy outcome, and data on sumatriptan use in pregnancy were obtained from animal studies, preclinical drug trials, postmarketing surveillance efforts, prospective pregnancy registries, national birth registries and teratogen information services. Synthesis of information from these sources is sufficient to rule out a large increase in birth defects from sumatriptan use during pregnancy and is reassuring for cases where inadvertent exposure to sumatriptan during pregnancy has occurred. However, current information is not sufficient to rule out small increases in the risk for birth defects. For this reason, caution should be exercised in making a positive recommendation for the use of sumatriptan during pregnancy.",2,E

Although therapeutic advances in paediatric and adolescent migraine have lagged behind those in adult migraine, the first systematic studies of migraine medications in young patients have brought about progress in the past five years. These studies show that therapeutic approaches suitable for adult patients are not always applicable to paediatric and adolescent patients. Because of the unique characteristics of paediatric and adolescent migraine, it has been difficult to demonstrate in young patients the efficacy of oral sumatriptan and other triptan tablets, which are the medications of choice for adult migraine. With sumatriptan, this finding has proven to be a consequence of the form in which the drug was administered rather than the inherent properties of the drug. The availability of sumatriptan nasal spray allows the benefits of migraine-specific therapy to be extended to children and adolescents. In both well-controlled, single-episode studies and long-term, multiple-episode studies, sumatriptan nasal spray has been effective and well tolerated for the acute treatment of migraine in children and adolescents. Except for unpleasant taste, which is not significantly distressing to patients, sumatriptan nasal spray has a tolerability profile similar to thatof placebo in young patients.",4,E

The standard primary endpoint is conversion of headache score 2 (moderate pain) or score 3 (severe pain) into score 0 (no pain) or score 1 (mild pain) at a single timepoint (usually 2 or 4 hours postdose). Two principal methods have been used for comparison of ARR between studies: TG = ARR - PRR and TR = ARR/PRR. Secondary endpoints can be treated in the same way, although the 24-hour remedication rate is the only secondary endpoint that is subject to regulatory authority standardization. Does either TG or TR have an advantage over the other?; Efficacy data were collected from published sources and included pain score conversion at 2- and 4-hour, as well as 24-hour remedication rates. TG and TR were calculated for each endpoint, as shown above. The ranges of these variables were found from all observed measures. Correlations between TG and TR were found using least squares methods. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) for TG and TR were then found for all clinical trials, and for the whole range of observed PRR.; Values for TR and TG generally were well correlated for pain score conversion at 2 hours postdose (n = 51 clinical trials). Deviations from this correlation were greatest for drugs that were evidently very efficacious. When standardized for the observed ranges of PRR and ARR, the 95% CI for TR were narrower than for TG. A subset of these studies also reported 4-hour data (n = 23 clinical trials), but the correlation between TR and TG was again good, with narrower 95% CI for TR than TG. For the 24-hour remedication data (n = 18 trials), PRR was less variable; TR and TG again correlated well, but there was little difference in their relative 95% CI.; For comparison of drugs in noncontemporaneous studies, when PRR fluctuates, relative ranges for TR are narrower than for TG. For assessing single clinical trial results (ie, point estimates of efficacy) TR will generally be relatively nearer to its mean than TG. For both these reasons, TR is a more robust statistic than TG.",2,E

Adverse events were mild or moderate, and there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs or laboratory values.; The extent of absorption (AUC) of sumatriptan, NE, and EE was similar after oral administration of sumatriptan and NE/EE, both alone and in combination. Thus, in the opinion of the study investigators, there were no clinically relevant changes in the AUC of any of the medications when sumatriptan and NE/EE were administered concomitantly compared with administration alone. The results of this study suggest that dose adjustment is not necessary when sumatriptan is administered concomitantly with NE/EE in healthy premenopausal women.",4,E

The safety and tolerability of these drugs have been extensively investigated since the first triptan (sumatriptan) became commercially available. A report on a very large population of patients tested during clinical trials and in postmarketing studies, confirms that these drugs are safe and well tolerated when correctly used. Adverse events are frequently reported, but are usually mild and only a few patients discontinue therapy because of them. These adverse events include, in particular, the so-called 'triptan symptoms' (tingling, sensation of warmth, etc.). The exact mechanism of chest symptoms reported by 20% of patients with migraine treated with triptans remains unclear, but are exceptionally related to a cardiac mechanism. CNS adverse events (i.e. somnolence) are also reported, but it is a matter of debate whether they are related to the pharmacological properties (i.e. lipophilicity) of the drug or are symptoms of the disease itself. The potential risk for drug overuse must be taken into account when the triptans are given to patients with a high frequency of migraine attacks. Clinical interaction of triptans with other drugs metabolised in the liver may theoretically influence the incidence of adverse events, but there is little evidence to support this assumption. There is no evidence of a teratogenic risk of triptans in pregnant women taking these drugs.",I,I

The number of patients reporting side-effects was 14 in the acupuncture group, 23 in the sumatriptan group and 10 in the placebo group.; In this trial acupuncture and sumatriptan were more effective than a placebo injection in the early treatment of an acute migraine attack. When an attack could not be prevented, sumatriptan was more effective than acupuncture at relieving headache.",3,E

As a result, they have wide-ranging effects on the physiologic processes that they mediate. Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are highly potent at the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D antimigraine receptors and, as a consequence, the plasma concentrations that are necessary to produce the appropriate therapeutic and physiologic effects are very low. The broad spectrum of activity at other monoamine receptors is responsible for their side effect profile (dysphoria, nausea, emesis, unnecessary vascular effects). Both ergotamine and dihydroergotamine have sustained vasoconstrictor actions. In acute migraine treatment, their mechanisms of action involve constricting the pain-producing intracranial extracerebral blood vessels at the 5-HT1B receptors and inhibiting the trigeminal neurotransmission at the peripheral and central 5-HT1D receptors. The scientific evidence for efficacy is stronger for dihydroergotamine than for ergotamine. Their wide use is based on long-term experience.",3,E

While a typology of headaches has been recognized for some time, and a number of therapies have been introduced for reduction of headache pain and duration, the causes of migraine remain a subject of debate. Those prone to attacks continue to endure them and suffer the related symptoms such as nausea and disorientation. Frovatriptan, like all the triptans, acts by inducing vasoconstriction of the meningeal arteries. It has been shown in pharmacological tests to act selectively as a potent agonist of serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptors. Frovatriptan has been well tolerated in humans and efficacious in reducing headache pain and duration in clinical trials, which have also indicated that dose adjustments for age or gender are not necessary for the drug. Patients have found the use of frovatriptan acceptable over the long-term, and overall a low-incidence of adverse effects has been reported. Though not a prophylactic, frovatriptan has demonstrated the potential to significantly improve the therapeutic approaches to the treatment of migraine.",E,E

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have become the drugs of choice in the treatment of depression, and they are also effective in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and social phobia. New indications for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors include post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Extended-release venlafaxine has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Mirtazapine, which is unrelated to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is unique in its action--stimulating the release of norepinephrine and serotonin. The choice of antidepressant drug depends on the agent's pharmacologic profile, secondary actions, and tolerability. Sexual dysfunction related to the use of antidepressants may be addressed by reducing the dosage, switching to another agent, or adding another drug to overcome the sexual side effects. Augmentation with lithium or triiodothyronine may be useful in patients who are partially or totally resistant to antidepressant treatment. Finally, tapering antidepressant medication may help to avoid discontinuation syndrome or antidepressant withdrawal.",4,E

The aim of the study was to evaluate whether such an effect occurs also in patients with ineffective oesophageal motility (IOM). 16 patients (nine males and seven females, age range 34-55 years) with chest pain and mild to moderate dysphagia were studied; all had undergone previous cardiologic, radiologic and upper gastrointestinal endoscopic exams that were normal. An oesophageal manometry was performed using an electronic probe to record swallows, oesophageal, LOS and gastric motility. The patients whose motor pattern were compatible with IOM (>30% of motor waves with amplitude <30 mmHg and/or non-transmitted) received SUM or placebo 6 mg s.c., injected in the morning and in the afternoon in a random order. The data analysis was limited to 1 h before and 1 h after the drug injections. Ten out of the 16 patients showed an IOM motor pattern. The administration of SUM caused a significant increase in the number of swallows (SUM 99.5 +/- 15.4 vs 78.6 +/- 16.1 basal, P = 0.03) and of primary oesophageal motor waves (SUM 89.6 +/- 13.4 vs 67.2 +/- 12.9 basal, P = 0.04) with no significant changes in the percentage of swallows associated with propagation. Placebo was not associated with increase in the number of swallows (80.3 +/- 14.6, P = 0.9) or of primary oesophageal motor waves (70.1 +/- 12.3, P = 0.7). The amplitude and the percentage of propagated oesophageal motor waves as well as the mean basal LOS tone were unaltered by SUM. There was no change in the symptoms reported after SUM. Although effective in healthy subjects, SUM 6 mg s.c. improves only the numbers but not the amplitude or propagation of oesophageal motility of patients with IOM. The 5-HT1 pathway and its acute stimulation seem to play only a minor role in the pathogenesis of such a disease.",4,E

Eletriptan 40 mg demonstrated significantly greater efficacy than sumatriptan 100 mg in one previous trial.; Two thousand one hundred thirteen patients with a diagnosis of migraine according to International Headache Society criteria were randomized using a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group design, and treated for a single migraine attack with either eletriptan 40 mg, sumatriptan 100 mg, or placebo. The primary endpoint was 2-hour headache response. Secondary endpoints included headache response rates at 1 hour, pain-free rates, absence of associated symptoms, functional response at 1 and 2 hours, and sustained headache response.; Headache response rates at 2 hours postdose were significantly higher for eletriptan 40 mg (67%) than for sumatriptan 100 mg (59%; P <.001) and placebo (26%; P <.0001).

Results.-From the first month of implementation of autogenic training, headache frequencies were significantly reduced in patients with tension-type and mixed headache. Significant reduction in frequency was achieved in patients with migraine only from the third month of autogenic training. Decreases in headache frequencies were accompanied by decreases in consumption of migraine drugs and analgesics resulting in significant correlations among these parameters. Reduction in consumption of anxiolytic drugs was more rapid and robust in patients with tension-type headache compared to patients with migraine, and this outcome failed to show any correlation with change in headache frequency.; Schultz-type autogenic training is an effective therapeutic approach that may lead to a reduction in both headache frequency and the use of headache medication.",5,E

Therefore, we hypothesized that sumatriptan, a 5-HT1 receptor agonist specifically effective for treatment of migraine, would also alleviate high altitude headache. A randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial was performed on 29 mountaineers with at least moderate headache on the day of arrival at 4559 m. Fourteen subjects received 100 mg sumatriptan orally and 15 subjects received placebo. Before treatment there were no significant differences between groups regarding rate of ascent, duration and severity of headache, and acute mountain sickness score. All 6 female subjects were randomly assigned to placebo. Absolute values and the reduction of headache scores 1, 3, and 12 h after the administration of sumatriptan did not differ between treatment groups, but headache scores tended to be lower with sumatriptan after 1 or 3 h when compared with placebo. Considering only male mountaineers, there was a significant decrease of headache scores after 1 and 3 h. Because there was only a minor transient amelioration of high altitude headache with sumatriptan, we conclude that 5-HT1 receptors do not play a major role in the pathophysiology of high altitude headache.",4,E

The mechanism by which recurrence occurs is not clear, and the incidence of recurrence varies with the triptan used. In order to explore the pharmacological and physiological interaction of triptans and migraine headache recurrence further, some specific clinical, pharmacological, and pharmacokinetic factors that might influence migraine recurrence were evaluated in a review of the major efficacy data for the drugs in the triptan class. These factors were 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor activities, the pharmacokinetic elimination half-life of each triptan, and the clinical efficacy of each compound, determined by the proportion of patients with headache relief and the therapeutic gain over placebo.; Clinical data were derived from 31 triptan, placebo-controlled, major efficacy studies used in a previous meta-analysis. The mean recurrence rate, mean headache response, and therapeutic gain were calculated using the results from the individual clinical studies. Mean headache response and therapeutic gain were calculated at the time point used to define recurrence in each study. Data for binding affinity and potency were taken from a direct-comparison in vitro pharmacology study, and the elimination half-life quoted in the data sheet for each triptan was used. Rank correlation with recurrence rate was performed for each of the test parameters.; Mean headache recurrence rates ranged from 17% for frovatriptan 2.5 mg to 40% for rizatriptan. Elimination half-life and recurrence were inversely correlated (r = -1.0, P =.0016). There was also a significant inverse correlation between 5-HT1B receptor potency and recurrence (r = -0.68, P =.034), but 5-HT1D receptor potency was not correlated with recurrence (r = -0.20, P =.54). In addition, the binding affinities for the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors were not correlated to headache recurrence. Importantly, it also was demonstrated that initial clinical efficacy was not correlated to headache recurrence. The correlation coefficient for headache response was 0.18 (P =.53) and for therapeutic gain, -0.11 (P =.71).; The incidence of migraine headache recurrence varies between drugs in the triptan class.

The term complementary medicines describes a range of pharmaceutical-type preparations, including herbal medicines, homoeopathic remedies, essential oils and dietary supplements, which mainly sit outside conventional medicine. The use of complementary medicines is a popular healthcare approach in the UK, and there are signs that the use of such products is continuing to increase. Patients and the public use complementary medicines for health maintenance, for the treatment or prevention of minor ailments, and also for serious, chronic illnesses. There is a growing body of evidence from randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews to support the efficacy of certain herbal extracts and dietary supplements in particular conditions. However, many other preparations remain untested. Strictly speaking, evidence of efficacy (and safety) for herbal medicines should be considered to be extract specific. Pharmacovigilance for complementary medicines is in its infancy. Data are lacking in several areas relevant to safety. Standard pharmacovigilance tools have additional limitations when applied to investigating safety concerns with complementary medicines.",3,E

It remains a condition identified by exclusion, and continues to be a challenge to manage. Currently, only a limited number of pharmacological options are available. Antacids are no more effective than placebo in treating nonulcer dyspepsia. H2-receptor antagonists appear to be superior to placebo in efficacy, but many of the studies suggesting this finding have had a suboptimal study design. Proton pump inhibitors have been shown to be superior to placebo, although questions remain as to whether the only subgroup that responds is comprised of patients with unrecognized gastroesophageal reflux disease. Studies have found that prokinetic agents are superior to placebo, but currently only a very limited number of agents within this class can be prescribed in the United States. Sparse data support the role of metoclopramide and its side effects limit its use even further. The eradication of Helicobacter pylori has a small but positive therapeutic benefit in non-ulcer dyspepsia, and can be considered in those confirmed to be infected. Sucralfate is unlikely to be effective, and misoprostol is ineffective. Bismuth alone is probably not efficacious. Tricyclic antidepressants may have a therapeutic role, but this is not firmly established and this class of medication should be reserved for resistant cases. Emerging therapies include drugs that relax the gastric fundus, such as buspirone or sumatriptan, and the new prokinetic tegaserod. Psychological therapies may play a role but studies of these therapies are limited. Therapy for non-ulcer dyspepsia remains challenging and is usually empiric; it will remain so until the mechanisms that induce symptoms of dyspepsia are better understood.",4,E
12697002,The triptan formulations : how to match patients and products.,"Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Routes; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Prescriptions; Female; Humans; Male; Migraine Disorders; Serotonin Receptor Agonists; Sumatriptan; Treatment Outcome","Rapoport, Alan M; Tepper, Stewart J; Bigal, Marcelo E; Sheftell, Fred D","The 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists (the 'triptans') are migraine-specific agents that have revolutionised the treatment of migraine. They are usually the drugs of choice to treat a migraine attack in progress. Different triptans are available in various strengths and formulations, including oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal sprays and subcutaneous injections. In Europe, sumatriptan is also available as a suppository. Specific differences among the triptans exist, as evidenced by different pharmacological profiles including half-life, time to peak plasma concentrations, peak plasma concentrations, area under the concentration-time curve, metabolism and drug-drug interaction profiles. How or whether these differences translate to clinical efficacy and tolerability advantages for one agent over another is not well differentiated. However, delivery systems may play an important role in onset of action. Given that the clinical distinctions among these agents are subtle, identification of the most appropriate triptan for an individual patient requires consideration of the specific characteristics of the patient and knowledge of patient preference, an accurate history of the efficacy of previous acute-care medications and individual features of the drug being considered. The selection of an acute antimigraine drug also depends upon the stratification of the patient's migraine attack by peak intensity, time to peak intensity, level of associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, time to associated symptoms, comorbid diseases and concomitant treatments that might cause drug-drug interactions. Individual patient response to the triptans seems to be idiosyncratic and possibly genetically determined. Therefore, a set of specific questions can be used to determine whether a currently used triptan is optimally effective, whether the dose needs to be increased or whether another triptan should be tried. The clinician has in his/her armamentarium an ever-expanding variety of triptans, available in multiple formulations and dosages, which have good safety and tolerability profiles. Continued clinical use will yield familiarity with the various triptans, and it should become possible for the interested physician to match individual patient needs with the specific characteristics of a triptan to optimise therapeutic benefit. Use of the methods outlined in this review in choosing a triptan for an individual patient is probably more likely to lead to migraine relief than making an educated guess as to which triptan is most appropriate.",5,E
12698833,"Backache, headache, and neurologic deficit after regional anesthesia.","Analgesia, Epidural; Analgesia, Obstetrical; Back Pain; Female; Headache; Humans; Nervous System Diseases; Pregnancy","Munnur, Uma; Suresh, Maya S","Back pain, chemical backache, PDPH, and neurologic deficit all may be reported after regional anesthesia for childbirth. Back pain is common during pregnancy, but epidural analgesia during labor does not increase the incidence of long-term back pain. Chemical backache caused by 2-chloroprocaine is probably a result of hypocalcemic tetany of paraspinous muscles. The mechanism is presumed to be chelation of calcium by sodium bisulfite, an antioxidant present in nesacaine-MPF. PDPH after dural puncture is caused by leakage of CSF, which causes cerebral hypotension. Cerebral hypotension leads to traction on pain-sensitive intracranial structures and cerebral vasodilation. Initial therapy includes hydration, caffeine, and sumatriptan. EBP is the most effective treatment in severe PDPH. If the first EBP fails, a second blood patch can be performed. Neurologic deficits after regional anesthesia are rare. Meticulous technique and vigilance are the keystones in avoiding major neurologic complications of regional anesthesia. Rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential to optimize a successful outcome if complications do develop.",4,E

Plasma and urine concentrations of almotriptan were measured by HPLC. Treatment effects on almotriptan pharmacokinetics were assessed by analysis of variance. Ketoconazole coadministration increased mean almotriptan AUC and Cmax from 312 to 490 ng h/mL and 52.6 to 84.5 ng/mL, respectively. Mean oral clearance was decreased from 40.7 to 26.2 L/h by ketoconazole, with an accompanying increase in the fraction of almotriptan excreted unchanged in the urine (40.6% to 53.3%) and a decrease in renal clearance (16.4 to 13.8 L/h). These effects were statistically significant. The effects of ketoconazole on almotriptan clearance were consistent with inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and a slight effect on the active tubular secretion of almotriptan.",4,E

New triptans in several formulations will soon become available in the United States. Although the similarities of these 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonists outweigh their differences, important differences in pharmacokinetics and clinical responses do exist. Subcutaneous sumatriptan has the most rapid onset of action and greatest efficacy but the most adverse effects. Intranasal sumatriptan also has rapid onset of action, but at 2 hours its efficacy is comparable to that of oral zolmitriptan. Of the oral triptans, rizatriptan seems to have the greatest early efficacy. Both rizatriptan and zolmitriptan are now available as rapidly dissolving wafers. Almotriptan, the newest of the triptans, has a response rate similar to that of oral sumatriptan and may produce fewer adverse effects. Naratriptan and frovatriptan, with their slow onset, high tolerability, and long half-lives, may have a role in aborting prolonged migraine attacks and in headache prevention. Eletriptan at higher doses (80 mg) has a response rate approaching that of rizatriptan but may be limited by potential side effects. The many triptans available offer the opportunity to individualize migraine treatment, depending on the patient's attack characteristics, tolerance, and preferences.",E,E

A composite efficacy measure such as the sustained pain-free rate (no pain by 2 hours after dosing, no recurrence, no use of rescue medication from 2 to 24 hours after dosing) may be more appropriate.; Clinically relevant differences between almotriptan and other triptans were reviewed in the context of the attributes of acute migraine treatment that patients consider most important.; This review was based on published reports of open-label and placebo-controlled clinical trials of almotriptan, results of a survey concerning the attributes patients consider most important in a migraine medication, and a published meta-analysis of 53 placebo-controlled clinical trials of triptans involving >24,000 patients.; Almotriptan was effective and well tolerated in the placebo-controlled clinical trials; results of the 6- and 12-month open-label studies supported its good tolerability profile. A respective 87% and 86% of respondents to the patient survey indicated that they considered complete freedom from pain and no recurrence among the most important attributes of migraine treatment, both of which are included in the sustained pain-free rate. In the meta-analysis, almotriptan had a favorable efficacy and tolerability profile compared with other triptans, particularly with respect to sustained pain-free rate, which was significantly higher with almotriptan 12.5 mg compared with sumatriptan 100 mg (25.9% vs 20.0%, respectively; P < 0.05). In addition, the placebo-subtracted rate of adverse events was significantly lower with almotriptan compared with sumatriptan (1.8% vs 4.4%, respectively; P < 0.05). Results of a head-to-head placebo-controlled trial of almotriptan 12.5 mg and sumatriptan 100 mg supported the balance of efficacy and tolerability observed for almotriptan in the meta-analysis.; Data from clinical trials suggest that almotriptan is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of acute migraine pain. Based on a sustained pain-free rate that is among the highest and an adverse-event rate that is among the lowest for the triptans, almotriptan represents a therapeutic option for the initial treatment of acute migraine with or without aura.",I,I

Patient demographic (gender, age, race, height, and weight) and migraine (diagnosis, pain location and intensity, time and day of migraine onset and treatment, and associated symptoms) characteristics were examined.; One thousand nine hundred thirty-two adolescents with migraine were identified; mean age was 14.1 years (standard deviation, 1.64; range, 11 to 18) and 54% of patients were female. More males were represented in the 12- to 14-year-old group (646 [73%] of 885) than in the 15- to 17-year-old group (234 [26%] of 885). Most patients reported migraine without aura (67%, 1121 of 1672), unilateral migraine pain (58%, 458 of 787), and pulsating pain (74%, 582 of 790). Migraine was aggravated by physical activity in most of the adolescents (88%, 526 of 598).

In this study, we first analyzed the effects of opposing verbal suggestions on experimental ischemic arm pain in healthy volunteers and on motor performance in Parkinsonian patients and found that verbally induced expectations of analgesia/hyperalgesia and motor improvement/worsening antagonized completely the effects of a conditioning procedure. We also measured the effects of opposing verbal suggestions on hormonal secretion and found that verbally induced expectations of increase/decrease of growth hormone (GH) and cortisol did not have any effect on the secretion of these hormones. However, if a preconditioning was performed with sumatriptan, a 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist that stimulates GH and inhibits cortisol secretion, a significant increase of GH and decrease of cortisol plasma concentrations were found after placebo administration, although opposite verbal suggestions were given. These findings indicate that verbally induced expectations have no effect on hormonal secretion, whereas they affect pain and motor performance. This suggests that placebo responses are mediated by conditioning when unconscious physiological functions such as hormonal secretion are involved, whereas they are mediated by expectation when conscious physiological processes such as pain and motor performance come into play, even though a conditioning procedure is performed.",4,E

In the patients with normal trigemino-cervical responses during the pain-free phase the triptan was significantly more effective at relieving headache.; Our findings further support and emphasise the role of the trigeminal system in the pathogenesis of migraine. The bilateral location of the abnormalities suggests a centrally located dysfunction. Therefore, the trigemino-cervical reflex is sensitive in disclosing a disturbed brainstem activity and may be an index of neuronal activity in the human brainstem; moreover their assessment may help as valuable prognostic tool for predicting the efficacy of triptans therapy.",4,E

Secondary outcome measures included early headache response at 15, 30 and 45 minutes and headache response at 1 and 4 hours postdose, as well as pain-free rates at 15, 30 and 45 minutes and 1, 2 and 4 hours postdose. Laboratory assessments, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs and nose and throat examinations were performed at screening and follow-up visits. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study using Coding Symbols for Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms (COSTART) terminology.; Each dose of zolmitriptan nasal spray produced a greater 2-hour headache response rate than placebo (70.3%, 58.6%, 54.8% and 41.5% for zolmitriptan nasal spray 5.0, 2.5, 1.0 and 0.5mg, compared with 30.6% for placebo [all p < 0.001 vs placebo]).

Zolmitriptan nasal spray was well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being unusual taste and paresthesia. The majority of adverse events were of short duration and mild or moderate intensity. Only ten patients were withdrawn from the trial because of adverse events. Serious adverse events were reported by nine patients after taking study medication, but none was considered to be causally related to study medication. Zolmitriptan was not associated with any clinically significant changes in laboratory test values or vital signs.; All doses of zolmitriptan nasal spray produced significant 2-hour headache response rates compared with placebo. The 5.0 and 2.5mg doses were also significantly more effective than placebo for the majority of secondary efficacy measures. Zolmitriptan nasal spray 5.0mg provided a headache response statistically superior to both placebo and the 2.5mg tablet as early as 15 minutes after administration, while demonstrating pain-free outcomes significantly superior to placebo and the 2.5mg tablet as early as 30 minutes after administration.

Serum sumatriptan levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection in serial samples collected over 8 hours. Physical exam, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram measurements were monitored to assess safety and tolerability. A total of 16 subjects (10 males and 6 females) had pharmacokinetic data that could be analyzed, 2 withdrew from the study 30 and 60 minutes after dosing following the loss of venous access for blood sampling, and a bioanalysis failure resulted in loss of data from 3 subjects. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters (geometric mean and 95% confidence interval) for the remaining 16 subjects were as follows: Cmax was 13.9 (11.0, 17.6) ng/mL, AUC infinity was 57.3 (47.6, 69.0) ng/mL.h, and t1/2 was 2.0 (1.8, 2.3) hours. Population pharmacokinetic analysis for all subjects (n = 21) showed that clearance and volume of distribution increase slightly with age and body size, but the changes were minimal and would not warrant dose adjustment: CL/F was 316 L (coefficient of variance [CV] = 25%) and Vd/F was 1070 L (CV = 46%). Sumatriptan was well tolerated with only minor adverse events reported, which all resolved spontaneously. The pharmacokinetic parameters in these adolescent subjects were similar to those previously reported in adults, suggesting that adolescents should be dosed similar to adults.",2,E
12858070,Update on cluster headache.,Cluster Headache; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Genotype; Humans; Hypothalamus; Phenotype,"May, Arne; Leone, Massimo","Although cluster headache has traditionally been thought of as a vascular headache disorder, its periodicity suggests an involvement of central areas such as the hypothalamus. This review covers the past 3 years, which have seen remarkable progress in understanding the pathophysiology of circadian headache syndromes and have brought exciting news.; As more cluster headache patients are seen by headache specialists, new forms of this well-defined primary headache syndrome are being identified. In addition, we discuss recent findings with regard to abnormalities in the secretion of hormones, genetic influences, neuroimaging of cluster headache attacks, and the use of newer substances as preventive therapy in cluster headache.; We have entered a new diagnostic and therapeutic era in primary headache disorders. In recent reports, the use of deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus has enabled intractable chronic cluster headache patients to be successfully operated upon. Further research in this field is urgently needed and the recent possibility of combining deep brain stimulation with positron emission tomography will certainly help to unravel the brain circuitry implicated in stimulation-produced analgesia. The time has come to use the evidence for a disorder of circadian rhythm in cluster headache to further the development of chronobiotics in the treatment of this disorder.",E,E

Two new triptans, frovatriptan and eletriptan, and a nasal formulation of zolmitriptan have been recently developed. Eletriptan is effective for acute migraine treatment and may have some pharmacologic and clinical advantages. Frovatriptan has a longer half-life and lower headache recurrence rates compared with other triptans. It may be useful for patients who have prolonged attacks and high headache recurrence rate. Zolmitriptan nasal spray has a rapid onset of action and high efficacy. It should be considered when patients have rapid-onset attacks, especially when associated with severe nausea or vomiting. The butyrophenone neuroleptic droperidol is very effective in aborting acute migraine attacks. Central nervous system side effects are common, however, and the ECG should be monitored. Botulinum toxin type A shows promise as a safe, tolerable and effective drug for migraine prevention, with the unique advantages of almost no systemic adverse events and a long interval between treatments. The anticonvulsant topiramate is effective for migraine prevention. Cognitive side effects are of less concern with the lower doses needed for migraine. The angiotensin converting enzyme receptor blocker candesartan appears to be effective and highly tolerable in the prevention of migraine, but needs to be further evaluated.; New drugs expand the spectrum of migraine treatment both for the acute attack and for prevention.",I,E

Analyses were undertaken using two composite measures of treatment outcome constructed to reflect the requirements of patients more comprehensively than the conventional efficacy indicator of headache response at 2 hours. On the cost side of the equation, reflecting the health-care system perspective of the analysis, drug costs for initial dosing, second dosing for nonresponse, and recurrence and rescue medication were taken into account.; The analysis found that eletriptan treatment resulted in lower costs per successfully treated attack than those of sumatriptan under both outcome criteria.; Further refinement of outcomes measurement in migraine would be valuable and eletriptan has a potentially important role to play in the cost-effective management of the disorder.",2,E

In Phase I, >/=1000 adults from the general population in each country were interviewed by telephone using a routine consumer survey. The proportion of subjects meeting International Headache Society (IHS) criteria for migraine was assessed using an adapted Kiel headache questionnaire, whereas the impact of migraine on daily life was assessed using the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) questionnaire. In Phase II, >/=100 clinically diagnosed migraineurs per country were recruited through their general practitioners and migraine clinics. Semi-structured interviews based on written questionnaires assessed the impact of, and attitudes toward, migraine and its treatments. Respondents also completed the MIDAS questionnaire. Patients also sampled a demonstrator version of the new orange-flavored orally disintegrating tablet of zolmitriptan.; Phase I: An estimated 5% to 12% of the population in the different countries were classified as suffering from migraine, with most attacks categorized as fairly severe to very severe. Between 23% and 42% of migraineurs reported>24 attacks in the previous 12 months. Approximately one-half of all migraineurs did not seek medical advice. Of those who did consult a physician, only 3% to 19% were prescribed triptans. In all countries, the most commonly used current treatment was simple analgesics (22% to 54%). Phase II: Current migraine therapy was consistently effective in only 19% to 31% of patients, and only 21% to 50% of patients were satisfied with their current treatment. Many sufferers supplemented their prescription therapy with alternative management strategies, including herbal and homeopathic remedies, stress management, relaxation therapy, avoidance of trigger factors, and bed rest. Patients indicated that the most important attributes of migraine therapies are high efficacy and rapid pain relief. When asked to identify delivery options that they would like to see more of in the future, most patients (73%) specified ""a dissolve-in-the-mouth tablet."" Ninety percent of patients who sampled the demonstrator version of the zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet considered it to be ""very easy"" to use, and 99% stated it was suitable for use ""anytime/anywhere.""; In the general population samples we surveyed, there was a 5% to 12% prevalence of migraine across 5 different countries. As reported from previous epidemiologic studies, we found that many migraineurs still do not consult a physician. Despite high levels of disability, as assessed by MIDAS scores and evidenced by the need for bed rest during attacks, many migraineurs continue to treat their headaches with simple analgesics, which, if ineffective, leads to dissatisfaction with treatment. Patients desire a medication with high efficacy and a rapid onset of action, and an orally disintegrating tablet such as that used for the new zolmitriptan formulation, is a favored formulation and route of administration.",6,E

A cohort of 240,268 patients receiving pharmacy benefits from Merck-Medco (N = 65 + M) was followed over a one-year period. This analysis included patients who received at least two triptan prescriptions during the study (6/00-5/01). Ninety-one percent of the cohort remained on the same triptan during the study period. 'Co-prescription' was defined as any fill for a medication that was contraindicated or could potentially adversely interact with a triptan, obtained between and during the first and last triptan fills throughout the study period.; Mean patient age was 43 (SD +/- 11.6) and 82% were female. Twenty-one percent were co-prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, reflecting the considerable co-morbidity of migraine and depression. Patients taking triptans were almost never co-prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitors (0.02%), and co-prescription of ergots was also low (1.45%). Less than one percent (0.45%) received cimetidine while taking zolmitriptan, while 2.7% of patients taking rizatriptan 10 mg also took propranolol. While agents unavailable in the U.S. were not evaluated in this cohort, six percent of patients were treated with potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors, which would not be expected to cause any problems with the triptans in the survey. However, such agents are specifically contraindicated for use with one triptan (eletriptan), recently launched in the EU, suggesting that continued vigilance will be necessary to avoid coprescription of medicines with the potential for producing adverse side effects.; Triptan use mirrors migraine demographics. The frequency of co-prescription of triptans with SSRIs is about 20%. Continued vigilance will be necessary to avoid co-prescription of medicines with the potential for producing adverse drug events.",2,E

Hormonal changes can influence the occurrence of migraine, particularly related to the menstrual cycle. Menstrual migraine may require both acute and preventive treatment.; Gender differences in migraine may be a result of variations in the central nervous system of men and women as well as the effects of estrogen. Migraine attacks occurring in the perimenstrual period respond well to acute treatment with triptans. Hormonal manipulation may reduce migraine occurrence, especially when related to hormonal fluctuations in the perimenstrual period.; Effective migraine management requires an understanding of the unique epidemiologic and pathophysiological factors affecting women. An understanding of associated hormonal influences facilitates development of individualized treatment plans.",5,E

The patients who were treated had failed to respond to triptans in the past despite adequate doses on at least 2 separate trials of the same triptan or 2 trials involving different triptans.; There is limited evidence that dopaminergic antagonists may benefit the migraineur by relieving migraine pain and associated symptoms. The exact mechanism of action in migraine is unknown. The postulated action is the inhibition of dopaminergic overactivity. A dopaminergic antagonist, metoclopramide, may improve the efficacy of a 5-HT1B/1D agonist, sumatriptan.; In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 16 adult migraineurs fulfilling International Headache Society (IHS) criteria for migraine with or without aura who had failed to receive adequate relief from triptans treated one migraine with each treatment: sumatriptan 50 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg or sumatriptan 50 mg plus placebo to match metoclopramide. Patients treated their migraines when they were moderate or severe in intensity and recorded pain severity and symptoms prior to treatment and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes and 24 hours after treatment.; Thirteen women and 3 men (mean age, 40 years) completed the study; ie, treated 2 migraines (a total of 32 migraines), one attack with each treatment. Meaningful relief was attained in 10 (63%) of 16 migraines treated with the combination of sumatriptan 50 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg compared with 5 (31%) of 16 migraines treated with sumatriptan 50 mg plus placebo. Headache response (moderate or severe to mild or no pain at 2 hours) was achieved in 7 (44%) of 16 migraines with the combination of sumatriptan 50 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg compared with 5 (31%) of 16 migraines treated with sumatriptan 50 mg plus placebo. There did not appear to be a difference between treatment groups with respect to associated symptoms. The combination of sumatriptan 50 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg was well tolerated.; Combining sumatriptan with metoclopramide provided relief in some migraineurs who failed to achieve adequate relief with a triptan alone. It remains unknown whether initiating therapy when pain was mild or using a higher dose of sumatriptan (ie, 100 mg) would have provided additional benefit. Further studies are indicated.",3,E

No other selection criteria were used. Patients kept diaries for baseline pain intensity, the number of triptan tablets used, additional medication taken per attack, and their degree of satisfaction with the medication 2 hours after the initial dose. Patients recorded details for a maximum of 3 attacks. Analysis of variance or the Student t test and chi-squared or Fisher exact tests were used for univariate comparisons. A generalized estimating equation method was used to correct for within-subject variability. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.; One hundred twenty-six patients (85% women) recorded data for 318 migraine attacks. Rizatriptan was used to treat 122 attacks, almotriptan was used to treat 110 attacks, and a nontriptan medication was used in the initial treatment of 86 attacks. Triptan use (adjusted mean, 95% CI) per attack in this study was lower for rizatriptan (1.19 tablets; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.32) than for almotriptan (1.43 tablets; 95% CI, 1.30 to 1.56; P=.003). The use of a triptan and additional medication per attack increased with baseline pain severity. Rizatriptan was used to treat more attacks with only one tablet (78%) than almotriptan (58%). Treatment of attacks with almotriptan was more than twice as likely to involve the use of more than one tablet per attack (24 hours) than those treated with rizatriptan (adjusted OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.37 to 4.30; P=.003). Patient satisfaction with treatment response at 2 hours was more than 2-fold greater for rizatriptan (85%) than for almotriptan (68%) (adjusted OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.11 to 5.87; P=.03).; In this prescription-selected Spanish population, a significantly lower number of rizatriptan tablets were required to treat migraine attacks compared with almotriptan. Further, patients were more than twice as likely to use more than one tablet or additional medication (or both) for attacks treated with almotriptan than for those treated with rizatriptan. Although these data suggest that rizatriptan may be a more effective treatment for migraine than almotriptan, further randomized studies are required to confirm this conclusion.",5,E

The aim of the present work was to assess a satiety drinking test in the evaluation of accommodation in health and dyspepsia.; Twenty five controls and 37 severely dyspeptic patients seen at a tertiary care centre completed a dyspepsia questionnaire, and gastric emptying and gastric barostat studies. The amount of liquid meal ingested at maximum satiety during a slow satiety drinking test was determined. In controls, we studied the influence of caloric density and of pharmacological agents that influence accommodation.; In patients, satiety scores were higher and maximum satiety occurred at lower calories (542 (50) v 1508 (53) kcal; p<0.0001). Six patients had required nutritional support, but excluding these did not alter the correlations. With increasing severity of early satiety, less calories were ingested at maximum satiety. In multivariate analysis, the amount of calories was significantly correlated to accommodation but not to gastric emptying or sensitivity. Sensitivity and specificity of the satiety test in predicting impaired accommodation reached 92% and 86%, respectively. At different caloric densities, ingested volume rather than caloric load determined maximum satiety. Pharmacological agents (sumatriptan, cisapride, erythromycin) affected the satiety test according to their effect on accommodation.; A slow caloric drinking test can be used to evaluate accommodation and early satiety. It provides a non-invasive method of predicting impaired accommodation and quantifying pharmacological influences on accommodation.",4,E

Twelve principles of migraine management were identified, covering screening, diagnosis, management and treatments: Almost all headaches are benign/primary and can be managed by all practising clinicians. Use questions/a questionnaire to assess the impact on daily living and everyday activities, for diagnostic screening and to aid management decisions. Share migraine management between the clinician and the patient. Provide individualised care for migraine and encourage patients to manage their migraine. Follow up patients, preferably with migraine calendars or diaries. Regularly re-evaluate the success of therapy using specific outcome measures and monitor the use of acute and prophylactic medications regularly. Adapt migraine management to changes that occur in the illness and its presentation over the years. Provide acute medication to all migraine patients and recommend it is taken at the appropriate time, during the attack. Provide rescue medication/symptomatic treatment for when the initial therapy fails. Offer to prescribe prophylactic medications, as well as lifestyle changes, to patients who have four or more migraine attacks per month or who are resistant to acute medications. Consider concurrent co-morbidities in the choice of appropriate prophylactic medication. Work with the patient to achieve comfort with mutually agreed upon treatment and ensure that it is practical for their lifestyle and headache presentation. Using these principles, practising clinicians can screen and diagnose their headache patients effectively and manage their migraine patients over the long-term natural history of the migraine process. In this way, the majority of migraine patients can be well treated in primary care, ensuring a structured and individualised approach to headache management, and conserving valuable healthcare resources.",5,E

In the pre-crossover phase, 1,093 patients aged 18-65 years with an established diagnosis of migraine with or without aura received intranasal zolmitriptan 5, 2.5, 1 or 0.5mg for the treatment of mild, moderate or severe migraine attacks. When a headache persisted or recurred, a second dose of zolmitriptan nasal spray (or other approved escape medication) was permitted 2 hours post-administration but no later than 24 hours after the first dose. In the post-crossover phase, once a placebo-controlled, dose-finding study had established 5mg as the dose with the optimal clinical utility, all patients were crossed over under blinded conditions to receive this dose. As this was primarily a safety study, the primary endpoints for the study were the incidence and nature of all serious adverse events (at any time before or after administration) and nonserious adverse events (within 24 hours of administration), as well as the incidence of clinically significant abnormalities in either ECG or haematology and clinical chemistry parameters. Nose and throat examinations were performed before and after the study at 30 predetermined trial centres. Other endpoint measures included headache response rate, pain-free assessments, reduction in headache intensity, time to resumption of normal activities and consistency of headache response. Efficacy rates were measured in 90-day intervals up to a period of 360 days.; Zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg was well tolerated, with only 1.9% of patients withdrawing from the 12-month long-term trial because of adverse events. Adverse events occurred in 22.1% of attacks treated with zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg, and the majority were of short duration and mild or moderate intensity. Serious adverse events occurred in 0.2% of attacks treated with zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg. There was no evidence of increased incidence of adverse events with increasing duration of treatment. Nasopharyngeal adverse events were reported in 5.5% of attacks treated with zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg. Again, events were generally transient and of mild intensity. For the 1,093 patients who treated 13,806 attacks during the pre-crossover phase, headache response rates at 2 hours over all attacks were 73.2%, 70.5%, 49.9% and 41.5% for zolmitriptan nasal spray 5, 2.5, 1 and 0.5mg, respectively. Pain-free rates at 2 hours over all attacks were 51.5%, 48.1%, 24.7% and 21.8%, respectively. For the 783 patients receiving the 5mg dose in either the pre- or post-crossover phases, the 2-hour headache response rates were 72.9%, 74.4%, 74.6% and 74.1% for the four 90-day periods between day 0 and day 360. Normal activities were resumed within 2 hours in 60.4% of attacks. Long-term usage of zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg was also associated with a consistently effective response, with 57.8% of patients experiencing a 2-hour headache response in over 75% of attacks. The majority of patients (70.3%) rated their overall satisfaction with zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg as good or excellent.; Zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg provides good tolerability and efficacy in long-term use in a clinical setting, with consistently high 2-hour headache and pain-free rates. This combination of benefits translates to high patient satisfaction with this formulation of zolmitriptan.",3,E

Our goal was to assess the history of acute migraine medication use and the relationship between different migraine medication regimens and patient satisfaction with prior therapy.; This study was conducted at 85 neurology clinics throughout Spain from March Lo December 2001. It was planned prospectively as part of the screening visit for a multicenter trial of the effectiveness of rizatriptan therapy for migraine. Male and female patients >/=18 years of age were eligible for the primary trial, and hence for this study, if they had a history of migraine attacks and did not have a contraindication for triptan use. At the screening visit for the primary trial, a questionnaire was used by clinicians to record past and current use, and duration and order of use, of analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ergot derivatives, and triptans; satisfaction with treatment was scored on a 5-point scale ranging from ""very dissatisfied"" to ""very satisfied.""; Of 712 patients completing the questionnaire (mean [SD] age, 34 [10] years; range, 18-69 years), 75% were women and 94% experienced moderate or severe functional disability during migraine attacks. Analgesics were used by the majority of patients (81%) and for the longest mean [SD] duration (8.8 [7.6] years) but were associated with the least satisfaction (10% of patients ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied""). Triptans were used by the fewest patients (32%) and for the shortest mean duration (18 [1.6] years) but were associated with the highest rate of satisfaction (66%) compared with NSAIDs (27%) and ergot derivatives (31%). Regardless of duration or order of drug use, or sex or age of the patient, the likelihood of satisfaction with triptans was significantly greater (P < 0.001) than with nontriptan regimens, with an adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of 16.8 (11.4-24.9) versus analgesics, 5.1 (3.6-7.1) versus NSAIDs, and 4.1 (2.8-6.0) versus ergot derivatives.; Our results showed that analgesics, NSAIDs, and ergot derivatives were used for long durations but provided low satisfaction among patients. Triptans were rarely used as a first treatment choice; however, patients reported the highest treatment satisfaction scores after triptan therapy compared with ergot derivatives, NSAIDs, or analgesics.",3,E

Structural abnormalities, most notably white matter changes, occur in greater prevalence in migraineurs (16 - 40%). Several studies have examined the neuropsychological correlates of migraine and/or white matter abnormalities. These studies suggest mild, interictal dysfunction in migraineurs. More research is needed to correlate migraine severity, frequency and/or treatment with neuropsychological testing. Additional studies should: identify interictal cognitive changes; clarify the contribution to long-term cognitive changes from migraine genotype, sequelae of repeated pain episodes or their treatment and the consequences of co-morbid vascular disease; and include cognitive measures as secondary end points in clinical trials.",5,E

Following administration of sumatriptan 100mg orally, relief of migraine headache (at 2 hours) was achieved in 50 to 67% of patients compared with 10 to 31% with placebo in controlled clinical trials. In a comparative study, oral administration of sumatriptan 100mg consistently achieved significantly greater response rates than a fixed combination of ergotamine 2mg plus caffeine 200mg during 3 consecutive migraine attacks (66 vs 48% for first attack). Oral sumatriptan 100mg was also more effective than aspirin 900mg plus metoclopramide 10mg orally in a similar study. In the majority of controlled clinical trials, headache relief (at 1 hour after administration) was achieved in 70 to 80% of patients with migraine receiving sumatriptan 6mg subcutaneously compared with 18 to 26% of placebo recipients. Approximately 40% of patients who initially responded to oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan experienced recurrence of their headache, usually within 24 hours, but the majority of these patients responded well to a further dose of sumatriptan. Patients with cluster headache were treated for acute attacks with sumatriptan 6mg subcutaneously or placebo in 2 crossover trials. Headache relief was achieved within 15 minutes in 74 and 75% of patients receiving sumatriptan in these studies compared with 26 and 35%, respectively, with placebo. Patients receiving sumatriptan 12mg had a similar response rate as those receiving 6mg, but the higher dose was associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. Based on extensive safety data pooled from controlled clinical trials, sumatriptan is generally well tolerated and most adverse events are transient. The most frequently reported adverse events following oral administration include nausea, vomiting, malaise, fatigue and dizziness. Injection site reactions (minor pain and redness of brief duration) occur in approximately 40% of patients receiving subcutaneous sumatriptan, although the incidence appears to be markedly reduced when patients self-administer the drug with an auto-injector. Chest symptoms (mainly tightness and pressure) occur in 3 to 5% of sumatriptan recipients, but have not been associated with myocardial ischaemia except in a few isolated cases. Sumatriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischaemic heart disease, angina pectoris including Prinzmetal (variant) angina, previous myocardial infarction and uncontrolled hypertension, but is not contraindicated in patients with migraine and asthma. Data from long term studies in acute treatment of migraine and cluster headache suggest that sumatriptan remains effective and well tolerated over several months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",E,E

In this study patients with episodic cluster headache fulfilling the criteria of the International Headache Society were examined during an acute spontaneous attack of headache to determine the local cranial release of neuropeptides. Blood was sampled from the external jugular vein ipsilateral to the pain before and after treatment of the attack. Samples were assayed for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), substance P and neuropeptide Y. Attacks were treated with either oxygen inhalation, sumatriptan or an opiate. Thirteen patients were studied of whom 10 were male and three female. All had well-established typical attacks of cluster headache when blood was sampled. During the attacks external jugular vein blood levels of CGRP and VIP were raised while there was no change in neuropeptide Y or substance P. Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels rose to 110 +/- 7 pmol/l (normal: < 40) while VIP levels rose to 20 +/- 3 pmol/l (normal: < 7). Treatment with both oxygen and subcutaneous sumatriptan reduced the CGRP level to normal, while opiate administration did not alter the peptide levels. These data demonstrate for the first time in vivo human evidence for activation of the trigeminovascular system and the cranial parasympathetic nervous system in an acute attack of cluster headache. Furthermore, it is shown that both oxygen and sumatriptan abort the attacks and terminate activity in the trigeminovascular system.",2,E

Plasma levels of CGRP and SP were determined using sensitive radioimmunoassays for each peptide. CGRP-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) was found to be augmented in patients in an active period and became elevated further at the peak of the provoked attack. A complete reversal occurred both after spontaneous and sumatriptan-induced remission. On the contrary, nitroglycerin neither provoked a cluster headache attack nor altered CGRP-LI in the patients in a remission period. The augmented levels of CGRP-LI measured before and after nitroglycerin administration, when the provoked attack reached the maximum intensity, suggest an activation of the trigeminovascular system during the active period of cluster headache. Moreover, the clinical and biochemical actions showed by sumatriptan stress the involvement of serotonin in cluster headache mechanisms.",E,E

Several compounds have been proposed as headache-inducing agents, but only the nitroglycerin (NTG) model has been validated. In healthy subjects, intravenous infusions of the nitric oxide (NO) donor NTG induce a dose-dependent headache and dilatation of the temporal, radial and middle cerebral artery. NTG-induced headache, although less intense, resembles migraine in pain characteristics, but the accompanying symptoms are rarely present. Cephalic large arteries are dilated during migraine headache as well as during NTG headache. N-acetylcysteine enhances the formation of NO and potentiates NTG-induced headache, whereas mepyramine, a H1-antagonist capable of blocking histamine-induced headache, has no effect. Thus, the headache is dependent on NO or other steps in the NO cascade. The model is useful for pharmacological interventions and sumatriptan reduced the NTG-induced headache.

Forearm blood flow (FBF) is mainly determined by resistance vessels, whereas finger blood flow (FiBF) mainly involves skin vessels, which contain many AVAs. Changes in FBF and FiBF can be assessed using venous occlusion plethysmography. Changes in AVA flow are determined by measuring the patency of the vascular beds of the forearm and hand to well-defined radiolabelled microspheres, which are injected into the brachial artery. We report the effects of sumatriptan on FBF, FiBF and AVA flow when administered into the brachial artery of healthy volunteers, and discuss the peripheral vascular effects of therapeutic doses of sumatriptan when given subcutaneously in migraine patients during and between attacks.",2,E

A prospective, observational study was conducted to evaluate the characteristics of internal consistency, construct and discriminant validity, and responsiveness of the migraine quality of life questionnaire. One hundred thirty-eight subjects with migraine were recruited. One hundred seven subjects completed a baseline and a 24-hour postmigraine quality of life questionnaire, along with a migraine diary for recording headache severity, activity limitation, associated symptoms, duration of headache, and use of migraine medication. All five migraine quality of life questionnaire domains showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, 0.74-0.95). The strongest correlations were seen between activity limitation and associated symptoms and the migraine quality of life questionnaire work, social, and energy domains. Significant differences in mean questionnaire scores between subjects were found with frequency of medication use, global change in symptoms, headache duration, and severity.

In this crossover design study, all subjects received 2 treatments: a single 1-mg dose of butorphanol nasal spray and a 1-mg dose of butorphanol nasal spray plus a single 6-mg subcutaneous (SC) dose of sumatriptan. There was a two-week washout period between sessions. Serial blood samples were collected and plasma samples analyzed using validated radioimmunoassay and high-performance liquid chromatography/electrochemical procedures to determine the concentrations of unchanged butorphanol and sumatriptan, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences for butorphanol between the 2 treatments on any of the following pharmacokinetic parameters: Cmax, tmax, AUC, t1/2, CL/f, and Vz/f. Similarly, the pharmacokinetic parameters obtained for sumatriptan (given with butorphanol nasal spray) were comparable with the literature values obtained for a single 6-mg SC dose of sumatriptan. These data show a lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between butorphanol nasal spray and sumatriptan. Butorphanol nasal spray and sumatriptan were well tolerated. The adverse experience profiles of butorphanol nasal spray were comparable between the treatments, with and without sumatriptan. It can be concluded that regimens of butorphanol nasal spray and sumatriptan need not be changed for either pharmacokinetic or safety considerations when the two compounds are co-administered in treating acute migraine attacks.",4,E

The results indicated that sumatriptan and ergotamine progressively increase the peripheral expression of 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin). The increase obtained in migraine after ergotamine is more evident than that obtained in cases of cluster headache. Ondansetron produced a moderate increase in serotonergic expression only in cluster headache.

This article assumes a broader perspective and compares the clinical, economic, and humanistic attributes of two antimigraine medications, dihydroergotamine (DHE) and sumatriptan, based on a literature review. DHE is an established product with over 40 years of use in the treatment of migraine. Sumatriptan is a new product with a higher acquisition cost than DHE. Because sumatriptan costs more than DHE, the question must be asked. ""Does sumatriptan provide advantages that offset this price differential?"" This question reflects the growing concern among payers and patients over the cost and effectiveness of therapies. However, it is not easily answered. Direct comparative data are not available, and data sources are different for the two products. Moreover, the products are currently marketed in different dosage forms--intramuscular for DHE and subcutaneous for sumatriptan. The literature reviewed indicates that the clinical attributes of the two products are similar, with each having slightly different advantages and disadvantages. However, the DHE literature is generally limited to uncontrolled studies, whereas the sumatriptan literature reports the results of rigorously designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Published data on the products' economic and humanistic attributes are limited. We concluded that the literature does provide important, albeit limited, data on the economic, clinical, and humanistic attributes of DHE and sumatriptan that permit restricted comparisons. The limitations of the data highlight the need for comparative studies of these products' multidimensional attributes both in controlled clinical trials and under actual practice conditions.",E,E

Studies relating to this topic have focused on healthy volunteers and animals and have largely been confined to the effects of single drug doses. There is limited information about the effects of disease on pharmacokinetics under steady-state conditions. Changes in gastrointestinal motility may affect the pharmacokinetics of orally administered drugs by altering the rate of delivery, bioavailability or mucosal absorption of the drug. In general the rate of absorption and time taken to achieve maximal plasma concentrations for well absorbed drugs may be modified by changes in gastrointestinal motility, but overall bioavailability is not usually affected. In these cases the therapeutic and clinical effects of the alteration in pharmacokinetics will, therefore, depend on which parameters are important for the action of the drug. For poorly absorbed drugs both the rate of absorption and bioavailability are likely to be altered by changes in gastrointestinal motility. However, the complex effects of food and disease, as well as the properties and formulation of any drug (solubility, ease of dispersion, delayed release formulation) often make the prediction of the magnitude, or even the direction, of any effect difficult to predict. Drugs with direct effects on gastrointestinal motility may influence their own patterns of absorption. In patients with gastrointestinal motility disorders, drugs administered in a controlled release formulation, or those with poor bioavailability, are most likely to have a poorly predictable therapeutic effect. Care should be taken to ensure that the formulation of the drug, its timing of administration in relation to meals and the use of coadministered drugs optimise, or at least ensure consistent absorption.",E,E

Sumatriptan is available as an injection for subcutaneous administration and as a tablet for oral administration. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan differ depending on the route of administration. The mean subcutaneous bioavailability is 96% compared to 14% for the oral tablet. The lower bioavailability following oral administration is due mainly to presystemic metabolism. The inter-subject variability in plasma sumatriptan concentrations is greater following oral administration and a faster rate of absorption of drug into the systemic circulation is achieved following subcutaneous dosing. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan are linear up to a subcutaneous dose of 16 mg. Following oral dosing up to 400 mg, the pharmacokinetics are also linear, with the exception of rate of absorption, as indicated by a dose dependent increase in time to peak concentration. Sumatriptan is a highly cleared compound that is eliminated from the body primarily by metabolism to the pharmacologically inactive indoleacetic acid analogue. Both sumatriptan and its metabolite are excreted in the urine. Although the renal clearance of sumatriptan is only 20% of the total clearance, it exceeds the glomerular filtration rate, indicating that sumatriptan undergoes active renal tubular secretion. Sumatriptan has a large apparent volume of distribution (170 l) and an elimination half-life of 2 h. Oral doses of sumatriptan were administered as a solution of dispersible tablets and subcutaneous dosing was by injection into the arm. In clinical practice, sumatriptan is administered as a film coated tablet or by subcutaneous injection into the thigh.",4,E

Rescue medication was available 1 hour later. The primary end point was headache relief (improvement in headache from moderate or severe to mild or no pain) within 60 minutes of the first injection. Secondary end points included the acceptability of the self-injector, requirement for and efficacy of a second dose, relief of nonheadache symptoms, use of rescue medication, and adverse events. Significantly more patients taking sumatriptan than placebo reported headache relief 1 hour after the first injection (88% vs 11%, P < 0.001).

Single-dose pharmacokinetic studies reflect the way that sumatriptan will be used in routine practice, but relatively few studies have been published. Bioavailability is high (96%) following subcutaneous injection, but low (14%) following oral administration because of first-pass metabolism. Absorption is rapid after subcutaneous injection, with peak concentration reached in 10 minutes. After oral administration, multiple peak concentrations are observed, but a concentration that is 75% of the final peak concentration is usually reached within 45 minutes. Less than 20% of the drug is protein bound. The volume of distribution is greater than total body water at 170L. Total plasma clearance is rapid, with an elimination half-life of around 2 hours. There is one major metabolite (an indole acetic acid analogue) which is excreted in the urine as the free acid and its ester glucuronide conjugate. The pharmacokinetic profile of sumatriptan is not significantly affected by an acute migraine attack (absorption phase), old age or gender. Pharmacokinetic studies in individuals with hepatic and renal disease have not been published; however, care should be taken when sumatriptan is administered to patients with liver disease until such information is available. No significant interaction was found between sumatriptan and propranolol, flunarizine, pizotifen or alcohol (ethanol).",2,E

Compared to placebo, sumatriptan significantly lowered levels of plasma prolactin but increased those of plasma growth hormone. There was no effect on plasma cortisol concentrations. The neuroendocrine effects of sumatriptan differ from those of previously described 5-HT-receptor agonists, and may be a consequence of selective activation of 5-HT1D or 5-HT1B receptors. However, the present data cannot exclude the possibility that the neuroendocrine changes reflect nonspecific stress responses or changes in pituitary blood flow.",4,E

The headache is often pounding and the connections of the trigeminal nerve, the trigeminovascular system, have therefore been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine and studied extensively. Considerable attention has been given to the peripheral ramifications of the system as a possible locus of action for anti-migraine drugs while little attention has been focused upon possible central sites of action. It has been shown that certain peptides can act as markers for the trigeminal system, in particular calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and that CGRP is elevated in migraine. We have employed an animal model for activation of the trigeminovascular system to evaluate a new antimigraine compound, 311C90, that may have central and as well as peripheral trigeminal actions. Cats were anesthetized by halothane induction and alpha-chloralose maintenance (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), intubated, paralyzed and ventilated. Biparietal craniotomies were carried out to measure cerebral blood flow using laser Doppler flowmetry (CBFLDF). The external jugular vein was cannulated and blood drawn, centrifuged and frozen until processing. Stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion resulted in a mean maximum increase in CBFLDF of 39 +/- 5% at 20/s. The 5HT1 agonist 311C90 was administered intravenously in two doses (30 and 100 micrograms/kg) to cover the range of doses likely to be effective clinically. At each dose the CBFLDF effect of trigeminal ganglion stimulation was inhibited.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

This derives from two main research approaches, operational pharmacology, using selective ligands (both agonists and antagonists), and, more recently, molecular biology. Although the scientific community continues to deliberate about the hierarchy of criteria for neurotransmitter receptor characterisation, there seems good agreement between the two approaches regarding 5-HT receptor classification. In addition, the information regarding transduction mechanisms and second messengers is also entirely consistent. Thus, on the basis of these essential criteria for receptor characterisation and classification, there are at least three main groups or classes of 5-HT receptor: 5-HT1, 5-HT2, and 5-HT3. Each group is not only operationally but also structurally distinct, with each receptor group having its own distinct transducing system. The more recently identified 5-HT4 receptor almost undoubtedly represents a fourth 5-HT receptor class on the basis of operational and transductional data, but this will only be definitively shown when the cDNA for the receptor has been cloned and the amino acid sequence of the protein is known. Although those 5-HT receptors that have been fully characterised and classified to date (and, hence, named with confidence) would seem to mediate the majority of the actions of 5-HT throughout the mammalian body, not all receptors for 5-HT are fully encompassed within our scheme of classification. These apparent anomalies must be recognised and need further study. They may or may not represent new groups of 5-HT receptor or subtypes of already known groups of 5-HT receptor. Even though the cDNAs for the 5-ht1E, 5-ht1F, 5-ht5, 5-ht6, and 5-ht7 receptors have been cloned and their amino acid sequence defined, more data are necessary concerning their operational and transductional characteristics before one can be confident of the suitability of their appellations. Therefore, it is important to rationalise in concert all of the available data from studies involving both operational approaches of the classical pharmacological type and those from molecular and cellular biology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",E,E

The measurements were performed in a balanced sequence at four different times on each patient, twice during the migraine interval and once in each of two migraine attacks. First ES1 and ES2 were measured (stimulus intensity 20 mA, stimulus duration 0.2 ms, stimulation frequency 2 Hz, averaging of 10 responses), then the medication was given on a double-blind basis with an autoinjector using either 6 mg sumatriptan or a placebo solution. Thirty minutes after application the measurements were repeated. No significant differences were found in early and late exteroceptive suppression latencies and durations between baseline measurements. Treatment did not affect the latencies of ES1 and ES2. While sumatriptan caused a significant increase in ES1 duration (p < or = 0.05) both during the migraine interval and during the migraine attack, placebo showed no significant effect on ES1 duration. Treatment with sumatriptan during the migraine attack was accompanied by a significant increase in the duration of ES2 (p < or = 0.05), but no significant changes in the durations of the late suppression periods were observed under any other conditions. The results do not support the assumption that under the experimental conditions chosen migraine attacks are accompanied by a paroxysmal change in the brain-stem mechanisms involved in the modulation of the ES parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",2,E

Comparison group (n = 1336) inclusion required at least one medical claim with no diagnosis of migraine; a pharmacy claim was not required. Comparison group patients were matched to migraine group patients by age, gender, enrollment status, and subscriber or dependent enrollment status.; Total health services use, diagnosis-specific use of services, diagnostic procedures performed, comorbid conditions, medication use, and associated costs were tallied.; Migraineurs generated nearly twice as many medical claims as comparison group patients, and nearly 2.5 times as many pharmacy claims. Number of claims generated and numbers of patients who generated claims within each of 19 diagnostic categories indicated greater comorbidity in the migraine group. Migraineurs used emergency services more than did patients in the comparison group. Total medical and pharmacy claims costs were $3.4 million for the migraine group and $2.1 million for the comparison group.

Thirty minutes after administration the CNV parameters were measured again and the changes between pre- and post-treatment were taken as dependent variables. CNV amplitude baseline readings did not differ significantly between the four conditions. Neither administration of placebo nor sumatriptan led to a significant change in CNV parameters independent of whether significant clinical improvement of migraine headache occurred or not. According to our findings CNV-mechanisms between attack and interval are not subject to short-term changes, even though a small, not significant tendency towards a decrease in CNV amplitude during migraine attacks appears to exist. Therefore, it can be assumed that changes in the systems which are depicted by CNV readings are not involved in initiating and terminating acute migraine attacks.",E,E

Sumatriptan, injected at increasing doses into the vein, caused local venoconstriction after a 500 microgram dose, comparable to that induced by 0.5-1 micrograms of 5HT. This venoconstriction was completely inhibited by low doses of ketanserin (5 micrograms). Subcutaneous sumatriptan (6 mg) provoked a minor increase in vein tone, lasting less than 30 min. Non-venoconstrictive doses of sumatriptan (10-100 micrograms), injected in the hand vein, produced an amplification of NA-venoconstriction but not of 5HT-induced venoconstriction. A similar increased effect was displayed by subcutaneous sumatriptan (6 mg) for at least 1 h. Sumatriptan appears to cause peripheral venoconstriction only at high doses locally applied (in the hand vein), by acting on 5HT2 receptors. Clinical subcutaneous doses (6 mg) do not show significant venoconstrictive effects. The amplifying effect on NA venoconstriction, also caused by 5HT, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine in human cranial arteries, may be important in explaining the therapeutic action of sumatriptan in migraine attacks.",E,E

The mode of action of this drug in migraine and cluster headache is discussed. On the basis of a detailed review of all published trials and available data from post-marketing studies, the efficacy, safety, tolerability and the place of oral and subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of both conditions are assessed. A number of double-blind clinical trials have demonstrated that sumatriptan 100 mg administered orally is clearly superior to placebo in the acute treatment of migraine headache and achieves significantly greater response rates than ergotamine or aspirin. In other studies, 70 to 80% of patients receiving sumatriptan 6 mg sc experienced relief of migraine headaches by 1 or 2 h after administration, and patients consistently required less rescue medication for unresolved symptoms. Sumatriptan was also effective in relieving associated migraine symptoms like nausea and vomiting. Sumatriptan was equally effective regardless of migraine type or duration of migraine symptoms. Overall, approximately 40% of patients who initially responded to oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan experienced recurrence of their headache usually within 24 h, effectively treated by a further dose of this drug. In 75% of patients with cluster headache treated with sumatriptan 6 mg sc, relief was achieved within 15 min. Based on pooled study data, sumatriptan is generally well tolerated and most adverse events are transient. Adverse events following oral administration include nausea, vomiting, malaise, fatigue and dizziness. With the subcutaneous injection, injection site reactions occur in approximately 30%. Chest syumptoms are reported in 3 to 5% but have been associated with myocardial ischaemia only in rare isolated cases. The recommended dosage of sumatriptan at the onset of migraine symptoms is 100 mg orally or 6 mg subcutaneously. The recommended dosage for cluster headache is 6 mg sumatriptan sc. Sumatriptan must not be given together with vasoconstrictive substances, e.g., ergotamines, or with migraine prophylactics with similar properties, e.g., methysergide. Sumatriptan should not be given during the migraine aura.

Because of this, we used oral sumatriptan (Imitrex, Glaxo), a peripherally acting agonist of 5-HT1D receptors, in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled double crossover pilot study of 7 patients with episodic MFP of the temporalis muscles. The results showed that there was a significant reduction in pain intensity and increase in pain relief over time with both the active medication and the placebo, but no significant difference between treatments. All but 1 patient reported that they are not interested in retaking the same medication. These data suggest that oral sumatriptan may not be the drug of choice in the control of episodic MFP.",4,E

Eighty patients treated all migraine attacks for 6 months at home with a subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan 6 mg. A second injection could be taken after 1 to 24 hours if relief was inadequate, or if the headache recurred, and rescue medication could be taken 1 hour after the second injection. The primary end point was the percentage of attacks in which headache improved from severe or moderate before treatment to mild or absent at 1 hour after the first injection. A total of 1566 attacks were treated by the 80 patients and 69 patients completed 6 months of treatment. Headache relief was reported 1 hour after the first injection in a mean of 78% of attacks (83% in the first 3 months and 76% in the second 3 months). A second injection was required in a mean of 40% of attacks, and headache was mild or absent 1 hour after the second injection in a mean of 77% of attacks. Rescue medication was required after the second injection in a mean of 14% of attacks. At the end of the study, 87% of patients said that they would take the medication again, and at each clinic visit over 80% said that they found the injector easy to use. Adverse events were similar to those reported previously with sumatriptan and were mostly mild to moderate in intensity, short-lived, and resolved spontaneously. Subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg is an effective, well tolerated, and well accepted, long-term, acute treatment for migraine when self-injected by patients using the novel self-injector.",I,E

Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Cluster headache patients who were not taking prophylactic medication and had experienced seven or more attacks in the preceding observation week, treated a cluster headache attack at home with subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg using an autoinjector device. Patients were then randomized to take sumatriptan 100 mg or placebo at 8-hourly intervals for a 7-day period. Cluster headaches occurring during this period could be treated 5 minutes after onset with rescue medication (100% oxygen or simple analgesics). Diary cards were used to record details of the cluster headache pattern during the observation and study treatment weeks. Preemptive oral treatment with sumatriptan 100 mg tid for 7 days did not produce a significant reduction in the number or severity of cluster headache attacks occurring during an established cluster headache period. Oral treatment with sumatriptan 100 mg tid over a 7-day period was not associated with an increased or altered adverse event profile from that previously reported.",I,E

It has been reported previously that clonidine can potentiate tyramine-evoked mydriasis on the pain-free side of cluster headache patients. We examined whether a single oral dose of clonidine (200 micrograms) can also potentiate tyramine-evoked mydriasis in healthy subjects, using mydriasis to methoxamine, a directly acting sympathomimetic amine, as a control. 2. Eight healthy male volunteers participated in four weekly sessions. In the first two sessions (Experiment 1) the effect of clonidine or placebo on the mydriasis to tyramine hydrochloride eyedrops (75 mM; 2 x 10 microliters), and in the last two sessions (Experiment 2) the effect of clonidine or placebo on the mydriasis to methoxamine hydrochloride eyedrops (20 mM; 2 x 10 microliters) was examined. In both experiments subjects were allocated to drugs and sessions according to a double-blind balanced design. In both experiments, pupil diameter of both the treated and the untreated eyes was recorded in standard ambient light and in the dark, before, and 2 h after clonidine/placebo, via binocular infrared television pupillometry. Salivation (dental roll technique), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (sitting), heart rate, and self-ratings of mood and feelings (visual analogue scales), were also measured before, and 2 h after the ingestion of clonidine or placebo. 3. Both tyramine and methoxamine produced a significant mydriasis, which was more prominent in the light condition (change in resting pupil size; mm +/- s.e.mean: tyramine/light 1.05 +/- 0.28; tyramine/dark: 0.73 +/- 0.15; methoxamine/light: 1.65 +/- 0.28; methoxamine/dark: 0.85 +/- 0.15). Clonidine produced a significant miosis in the untreated eye which was more prominent in the light condition (change in resting pupil size; mm +/- s.e.mean: Experiment 1, light: -1.34 +/- 0.19; Experiment 1, dark: -0.46 +/- 0.1; Experiment 2, light -0.97 +/- 0.18; Experiment 2, dark: -0.29 +/- 0.17). Clonidine had no significant effect on either tyramine- or methoxamine-evoked mydriasis. 4. In agreement with previous reports, clonidine significantly reduced salivation (g, mean +/- s.e.mean; Experiment 1: -0.84 +/- 0.22; Experiment 2: -0.55 +/- 0.11), systolic blood pressure (mm Hg; Experiment 1: -17.5 +/- 3.76; Experiment 2: -23.38 +/- 4.67), diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg; Experiment 2: -12.38 +/- 2.05), alertness (mm; Experiment 2: -24.19 +/- 5.40), and anxiety (mm; Experiment 1: -13.82 +/- 4.60), indicating the presence of pharmacodynamically effective tissue levels of the drug. 5. These results show that a single oral dose (200 micrograms) of clonidine causes significant miosis in human subjects, and fails to potentiate tyramine-evoked mydriasis. This indicates that the pupil on the asymptomatic side of cluster headache patients is affected differently from the pupils of healthy volunteers by tyramine and/or clonidine.",3,E

Many environmental factors and physiologic influences may provoke a migraine or increase its severity. The typical migraine headache without aura is unilateral, pulsating, of moderate-to-severe intensity, and aggravated by physical activity. Migraine prevention is best achieved by avoidance of known migraine triggers or enhancers and by reducing the amount of lifestyle stressors.

Of the 3 isoforms, endothelin-1 is the major isoform produced by the vascular endothelium and is, therefore, likely to be of most importance for regulation of vascular function. Two endothelin receptor subtypes have so far been cloned in mammalian species; ET A, and ET B. Both receptor subtypes are found on smooth muscle cells and mediate the vasoconstrictor and pressor actions of endothelin. The ET B receptor is also found on vascular endothelial cells and mediates endothelin-dependent vasodilatation through release of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. Since their discovery in 1988, the endothelins have been the subject of intense research on their physiological function and potential pathophysiological role in cardiovascular disease. There is now good evidence that endothelin regulates vascular tone and blood pressure, and studies to support the development of endothelin receptor antagonists in conditions associated with chronic vasoconstriction, such as hypertension and heart failure, as well as in vasospastic disorders, such as subarachnoid haemorrhage and Raynaud's disease. There are now a number of selective ET A and combined ET A/B receptor antagonists available for preclinical studies. However, it is still not clear which of these will prove to be of most therapeutic value. Some of these agents are currently being assessed in early phase clinical trials. Endothelin receptor antagonists represent a novel therapeutic approach to a fundamental and newly discovered endogenous vasoconstrictor mechanism. The results of the current clinical trials are awaited with considerable interest.",E,E

Medication should be introduced as early as possible, but only when there is no doubt that the headache is due to migraine. The antiemetic provides relief from the nausea and vomiting and also enhances the resorption of analgesics or ergot preparations. Domperidone 20 mg orally and 20 mg metoclopramide as suppository or 10-20 mg orally are mostly used as antiemetics. Analgesics such as 1000 mg acetylsalicylic acid as effervescent tablets, or 1000 mg paracetamol as effervescent tablets or suppositories should be given 15-20 min later. If this treatment fails, NSAIDs can be tried. In some studies naproxen in doses between 500 and 1000 mg and ibuprofen in doses between 400 and 800 mg have been shown to be effective, as well as NSAIDs like diclofenac, mefenamic acid, ketoprofen, tolfenamic acid and pirprofen.

The results are based on the patient's cumulative experience of more than 20,000 subcutaneous injections and more than 2,000 tablet doses. The average period during which subcutaneous sumatriptan (12 mg/ml, 0.5 ml) was used was 19.1 +/- 0.4 months and 84% of the patients had used more than 10 injections. The average number of migraine attacks per month was 3.0 +/- 0.1, injections per attack 1.7 +/- 0.1, and number of tablets (100 mg) per attack 1.8 +/- 0.2. Attack duration was decreased from on average 38.4 +/- 2.1 h to 2.3 +/- 0.5 h by subcutaneous sumatriptan and to 3.4 +/- 1.0 by orally administered sumatriptan. The average degree of efficiency at work with migraine was 76.3 +/- 1.9% on sumatriptan compared with 26.6% on other treatment options; 85% said that sumatriptan was much better than previous conventional therapies tested. During their experience with sumatriptan, 89% of the migraineurs reported altogether 1,058 adverse events (average 3.6 +/- 01, range 1 to 12) in connection with subcutaneous sumatriptan treatment. The three most frequent were drowsiness/sedation (49%), chest symptoms (40%) and injection site symptoms (37%). Among the table users, 87% reported altogether 122 adverse events (average 2.6 +/- 0.3, range 1 to 11). Seventy-eight percent of the responders responded to subcutaneous sumatriptan sometimes (22% always, 15% every second attack, 40% seldom) experienced a recurrence of their headache within 24 h. The average number of recurrences was 1.7 +/- 0.1 and the average time to recurrence 13.0 +/- 0.6 h (range 1.5-24 h). It is concluded that the selected group of migraineurs found sumatriptan to be very effective in reducing the symptoms of their migraine attacks, but also to cause several adverse events, in many cases, with short-lasting effect.",I,E

This is one of several explanations for there being so few well-designed, randomized, double-blind clinical trials in cluster headache. The standard treatment of acute attacks of cluster headache is inhalation of 100% oxygen. In the prophylaxis of episodic cluster headache, ergotamine, verapamil, lithium, serotonin, inhibitors and steroids are used. In chronic cluster, lithium is the drug of choice, but verapamil may also be tried. Recently, hyperbaric oxygen has been shown to immediately abort acute attacks, and it seems that it may also be useful in the prophylactic treatment. The introduction of the novel 5HT1 agonist sumatriptan as a symptomatic relief of cluster attacks represents further significant progress. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trials have shown sumatriptan 6 mg sc to be a rapid, effective and well-tolerated acute treatment for cluster headache attacks. Within 15 min of treatment, 74% of attacks on sumatriptan responded compared to 26% of placebo-treated attacks. Functional disability was also significantly improved. Increasing the dose to 12 mg did not offer significantly greater relief compared to sumatriptan 6 mg, but was associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. Interim analysis of 3 months of data from a recent multinational open trial comprising, 138 patients having treated 6353 attacks with subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg revealed a headache relief in 96% of attacks treated. There was no evidence of an increased incidence of adverse events with frequent use of sumatriptan. No tachyphylaxis was seen over the 3 months, suggesting that sumatriptan is effective and well tolerated also in long-term acute treatment for cluster headache.",I,E

Two hundred sixty-six adult migraineurs (International Headache Society criteria) completed a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, cross-over study. Patients took SC sumatriptan for one attack and DHE nasal spray for the other in random order. Data from both treatment periods show that at all time points from 15 minutes, SC sumatriptan was significantly better than DHE nasal spray at providing both headache relief (moderate/severe headache improving to mild/none) and resolution of headache. Similarly, SC sumatriptan was superior to DHE nasal spray for the other efficacy end points assessed in the study. Patients reported that both treatments were well tolerated. Adverse events were reported by 43% of patients taking SC sumatriptan and 22% of patients taking DHE nasal spray. These were usually mild and transient. We conclude that subcutaneous sumatriptan has a faster onset of action than DHE nasal spray and provides greater relief of acute migraine symptoms.",I,E

Neither buspirone nor sumatriptan administration modified the basal secretion of AVP and OT. Stimulation of 5HT-1D receptors with sumatriptan was unable to change neither AVP nor OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. On the other hand, the pretreatment with the 5HT1A agonist buspirone significantly enhanced the OT response during hypoglycemia, without modifying the AVP rise. The results of this study suggest that serotonergic 5HT1A receptors may interact with hypoglycemia in the stimulation of OT, but not AVP secretion.",2,E

There were 28 females and 22 males. The dose of sumatriptan was 0.06 mg/kg. Parameters included overall efficacy, time to relief, recurrence rate, adverse events, and objective global rating. Overall efficacy, defined by headache reduction from severe or moderate to mild or none, was 78%. Twenty-six percent responded within 30 minutes, 46% responded in 60 minutes, and 6% responded between 1 to 2 hours. Twenty-two percent had no response or a suboptimal response. Recurrence rate was only 6%. There was a difference in efficacy between male and female, as 91% of the males responded, while only 68% of the females responded. The males had more migraine alone while the females had migraine often with a coexistent tension-type headache. Eighty percent of all the patients had some adverse event which was usually mild and transient; however, one patient developed a transitory confusional state which resolved in 2 hours. Eighty-four percent reported a global rating of good to excellent, while 16% rated the treatment only fair to poor. These findings suggest that subcutaneous sumatriptan can be both effective and safe in childhood migraine, especially in dealing with migraine alone.",4,E

In a few cases, indomethacin is not tolerated because of side effects. Therefore, the efficacy of carbamazepine, verapamil, sumatriptan, acetylsalicylic acid, and oxygen as drugs in the prophylactic or acute treatment of chronic paroxysmal hemicrania was studied in a prospective open trial with 10 patients suffering from chronic paroxysmal hemicrania. The trial results, in accordance with a review of the literature, suggest that acetylsalicylic acid (and probably naproxen and diclofenac) and verapamil are the most effective drugs of second choice in chronic paroxysmal hemicrania. The efficacy of sumatriptan in this condition needs still to be clarified, although there is evidence for partial efficacy.

The study also aimed to provide an initial safety profile for 311C90 when taken during the aura. Forty patients (31 females, 9 males) were entered into this outpatient, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover trial. They all almost invariably experienced a migraine headache after the aura phase. Patients treated two migraine attacks during the aura phase in a random order, one with 311C90 20 mg and the other with placebo. Efficacy assessments were recorded on standard diary cards completed by each patient. A primary response was defined as the complete absence of headache pain in the 24 hour period following administration of the first dose of study medication. Safety assessments included ECGs, laboratory tests and the recording of adverse experiences. Twenty patients completed the study by treating 2 attacks, 16 of these were fully adherent to the study protocol. Three of the 16 patients responded to 311C90 whereas all patients developed a migraine headache after taking placebo. Two patients who did not respond to 311C90 described the developing headache as being ""non-migraine'. Adverse experiences reported were similar to those experienced by patients in previous studies when 311C90 was taken during a migraine headache. There were no reports of 311C90-related adverse effects on the aura. These preliminary results suggest that oral 311C90 may be of value in preventing a migraine headache and is safe when taken during the aura phase. This intriguing possibility therefore warrants further investigation possibly utilising formulations that would deliver meaningful plasma levels of drug more rapidly.",I,E

In humans it is still unclear whether sumatriptan acts via constriction of dilated arteries or through other mechanisms. Doppler sonography is a non-invasive method for measuring blood flow velocities (BFV), an indirect marker of vessel diameter. This double-blind crossover placebo-controlled trial investigated changes in BFV in extra- and intracranial arteries in 132 migraine attacks (66 patients) before and after treatment with either 6 mg sumatriptan s.c. or placebo. Significant increases in BFV were observed only in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the basilar artery (BA) after administration of sumatriptan. However, the majority of the patients showed no change in BFV following sumatriptan. No difference in BFV could be detected between headache and non-headache side or between migraine and headache free periods. Despite a slight increase in BFV in intracerebral arteries, this study does not support the concept that vasoconstriction is sumatriptan's principal mechanism in pain relief.",E,E

The safety and efficacy of 311C90 in acute migraine were also assessed. Twenty patients attended the clinics during a moderate or severe migraine attack and 18 patients returned for a second dose in a migraine-free period. 311C90 was less rapidly absorbed during a migraine attack compared to the migraine-free period, consistent with gastric stasis during a migraine attach.

In this case report, valproic acid was given to a 24-year-old woman with chronic headaches at 1000 mg per day. Her headaches resolved for 2 months. She tapered herself off of the medication, and her headaches returned. She was restarted at 500 mg per day of valproic acid and again, her headaches resolved. She preferred being on the lower dose which she found as effective as the higher dose. Her case makes two interesting points. The first is that lower dosages of valproic acid may be as effective as higher ones in headache prophylaxis. The second is that more studies looking at dose ranges are needed to correlate effectiveness with daily requirements.",6,E

Related research articles and review articles were also used to provide background information on PDPH.; Methodology and results from clinical trials and abstracts were described and evaluated. Case reports and letters were summarized and critically reviewed for the feasibility of the different treatment modalities. Information on the pathophysiology, incidence and severity, and clinical presentation of PDPH was extracted from related research articles, review articles, and textbooks.; The epidural blood patch (EBP) is one of the most effective treatments for PDPH. Pharmacologic management of PDPH offers a less invasive treatment modality than the EBP. Numerous drug therapies have been presented in the literature, though few merit clinical application. Caffeine therapy, both oral and parenteral, is the most commonly used pharmacologic treatment modality. Theophylline and sumatriptan are potentially promising agents for the treatment of PDPH. Epidural administration of fluids and drugs is also effective in the treatment of PDPH. Epidural adrenocorticotropic hormone and epidural morphine also demonstrate some potential in the treatment of PDPH. Individual patient characteristics (i.e., HIV, sepsis) need to be considered when deciding on a treatment. More reports, especially clinical studies, are necessary before a definitive statement can be made regarding any one treatment. In the meantime, therapy will be guided by clinical judgement based on the literature reviewed in this article.; Intravenous and oral caffeine are effective and noninvasive treatments for PDPH.

This study utilized a double-blind, parallel-group dose ranging format, comparing BMS180048 in doses of 25, 50, or 75 mg to placebo in effectiveness of treatment of a single migraine headache. To assess tolerability of BMS180048, patients received a test dose of the medication they would receive for a headache in the clinic under observation. If no significant side effects occurred, patients were allowed to treat a headache. Headaches were moderate or severe in intensity before treatment, and response at 2 hours was tabulated. Reduction to mild or no headache was the criteria for successful response. Response rates at 2 hours were as follows: placebo--19 of 53 subjects (35.8%); 25 mg--21 of 53 subjects (40.3%); 50 mg--34 of 53 subjects (64.2%); 75 mg--35 of 55 subjects (63.6%) The improvement for subjects treated with 50 or 75 mg of BMS180048 when compared to placebo was highly significant (P < .01).

The number of doses of all drugs prescribed ranged from 121 to 18,874 on from 4 to 357 prescriptions per patient over 1 to 19 months. The mean number of doses of analgesic drugs prescribed before sumatriptan therapy was 56 per month and after initiation of sumatriptan was 46 per month. The prescribing of multiple analgesics was common; 79% received three or more different analgesics. Twenty-two (63%) patients were prescribed medications indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine concomitantly with drugs indicated for symptomatic treatment. Twenty-four (69%) patients were prescribed medication capable of inducing migraine. We conclude that sumatriptan did not have a major impact on the outcomes of these patients judged by their use of analgesics. The simplest explanation is that many of the patients were suffering from analgesic-induced headache rather than migraine. In addition, we conclude that there were deficiencies in prescribing practices including numbers, quantities, and choice of analgesics; the use of analgesics concomitantly with drugs indicated for migraine prophylaxis; and the use of drugs capable of inducing migraine.

In a multinational double-blind randomized parallel-groups dose-finding trial, alniditan was given subcutaneously in hospital to patients with migraine headache of moderate or severe intensity at doses of 0.8 mg (n = 44), 1.0 mg (n = 42), 1.2 mg (n = 46) and 1.4 mg (n = 39). Efficacy, tolerability and safety of each dose were compared with those of placebo (n = 41). At 2 h after injection, headache was absent or mild in 83% and 82% of patients receiving alniditan 1.2 and 1.4 mg respectively compared with 39% for placebo (p < or = 0.002). Complete relief from headache was achieved in 72% (1.4 mg). Time to onset of relief decreased with increasing alniditan dose, and there was a dose-dependent reduction in headache recurrence rate: 25% of patients receiving 1.4 mg had responded by 15 min and headache recurred within 24 h in only 16% of the patients who initially responded to alniditan 1.4 mg, significantly less than for placebo (p = 0.018). Alniditan was superior to placebo in reducing the associated symptoms of nausea, phonophobia and photophobia, and in increasing patients' functional ability. The use of rescue medication was reduced when compared with placebo, and up to 87% of patients said that they would use the drug again if available. No clinically relevant cardiovascular effects were seen, nor consistent changes in clinical laboratory findings. Adverse effects, mainly head pressure, paraesthesia, and hot flushes, were reported by 34% of placebo-treated patients and up to 70% of patients receiving alniditan, but all doses were very well tolerated and no clear relationship with dose was established. Comparison with published findings suggests that alniditan 1.4 mg sc may have advantages over sumatriptan 6 mg sc in providing complete relief from acute migraine headache, and may be associated with fewer headache recurrences within 24 h.

Patients treated migraines with their usual therapy for 12 to 18 weeks followed by subcutaneous sumatriptan for 6 months. Health-related quality of life measurements obtained at baseline, after usual therapy, and after sumatriptan therapy included the Short Form-36 Health Survey and the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire. Patient daily diaries were used to capture data on migraine symptoms and on Lost Workplace Productivity and Non-workplace Activity Time. Traditional clinical efficacy measures were obtained to support the pharmacoeconomic data. Clinical data showed that the percentage of treated migraine days per patient on which the patient experienced relief (moderate or severe pain reduced to mild or none) was 75% with sumatriptan and 25% with usual therapy. The mean time to meaningful relief was 1.1 hours during the sumatriptan phase and 4.2 hours during the usual therapy phase. Lost Workplace Productivity and Nonworkplace Activity Time was 35% lower with sumatriptan therapy (1.5 hours) compared with usual therapy (2.3 hours).

Results of this study indicate that IV doses of MK-462 from 5 to 90 micrograms kg-1 are well tolerated. The disposition kinetics of MK-462 were linear for IV doses up to and including 60 micrograms kg-1. The values of the plasma clearance (CL), steady-state volume of distribution (Vss), plasma terminal half-life (t1/2), and mean residence time in the body (MRT) of MK-462 averaged 1376 mL min-1, 140 L, 1.8 h, and 1.7 h, respectively, and remained essentially constant over the dosage range of 10-60 micrograms kg-1 of IV MK-462. However, as the dose increased from 60 to 90 micrograms kg-1, the mean value of the apparent CL decreased from 1376 to 807 mL min-1. Thus, elimination of MK-462 was dose dependent in this dosage range. Based on the disposition decomposition analysis (DDA), it was shown that the Vss value of MK-462 remained essentially constant over the dosage range of 10-90 micrograms kg-1 of IV MK-462. The following values of two dose-independent parameters were also calculated by using DDA: distribution clearance (CLd) = 2028 mL min-1, and mean transit time in the peripheral tissues (MTTT) = 0.74 h. The mean values of AUC, Cmax, tmax, and apparent t1/2 of MK-462 in 12 subjects each receiving a 40 mg tablet of MK-462 without breakfast were 330 ng.h mL-1, 77 ng mL-1, 1.6 h, and 1.8 h, respectively. Although administration of a standard breakfast prior to dosing increased the AUC value (by approximately 20%) of MK-462 and delayed its absorption, there were no significant effects of the meal on the values of Cmax and apparent t1/2 of MK-462.",4,E

Although statistically significant differences in lost nonworkplace activity time and lost workplace productivity time between the usual therapy and sumatriptan treatment periods were detected using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, this test could not determine whether differences were attributable to inherent trends in the data. This current study employed time series analysis, which detects and controls for preexisting trends in data, to further explore the possibility that the observed reductions in lost time in the two clinical studies were related to management of the subjects with sumatriptan. The intercepts and slopes of the computed linear models suggest that the initiation of sumatriptan therapy produced savings of 0.8 hours of nonworkplace activity time and 0.5 hours of workplace productivity time per patient per week. These savings were sustained throughout the sumatriptan treatment period. Preexisting trends in the data were not detected in the models. Thus the productivity gains are not associated with either time effects or the statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean, but variables that are extreme in initial measurements will tend to be closer to the center of the distribution in subsequent measurements. This strengthens the hypothesis that management of migraine with sumatriptan is associated with reductions in lost productivity time.",I,E

Individual patient data from randomised controlled trials of single-dose analgesics in acute postoperative pain were used. The methods used were as follows: data from 132 treatments with over 4700 patients were used to calculate mean %maxSPID (categorical pain intensity), %maxVAS-SPID (visual analogue pain intensity) and %maxVAS-TOTPAR (visual analogue pain relief); these were used to derive relationships with the number of patients who achieved at least 50% pain relief (%maxTOTPAR). Good agreement was obtained between the actual number of patients with > 50%maxTOTPAR and the number calculated for all three measures. For SPID, verification included independent data sets. For calculations involving each measure, summing the positive and negative differences between actual and calculated numbers of patients with > 50%maxTOTPAR gave an average difference of less than 0.25 patients per treatment arm. Reports of randomised trials of analgesics frequently describe results of studies in the form of mean derived indices, rather than using discontinuous events, such as number of proportion of patients obtaining at least 50% pain relief. Because mean data inadequately describe information with a non-normal distribution, combining such mean data in systematic reviews may compromise the results. Showing that dichotomous data can reliably be derived from mean SPID, VAS-SPID and VAS-TOTPAR as well as TOTPAR data in previously published acute pain studies makes much more information accessible for meta-analysis.",E,E

Do children with migraine respond to oral sumatriptan differently from adults?,"Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Child; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Migraine Disorders; Pain; Placebos; Sumatriptan; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome","H盲m盲l盲inen, M L; Hoppu, K; Santavuori, P","Oral sumatriptan is an effective acute treatment for migraine in adults, but its efficacy in children is still undetermined. Twenty-three children, aged 8.3 to 16.4 years, took both sumatriptan and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. The primary endpoint was a > or = 50% decrease in pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analogue scale at 2 hours. Other endpoints of efficacy were pain intensity difference (PID), showing pain relief at each time point; summed pain intensity differences (SPIDs), estimating overall pain relief; and preference. Two hours after sumatriptan, 7 of 23 reached the primary endpoint, and after placebo, 5 of 23 (difference 9%, 95% CI for difference, -21 to 38%; p = ns). Within 2 hours, the headache disappeared completely in 5 of 23 children after sumatriptan and in 2 of 23 children after placebo (p = ns). Median PIDs were slightly better for sumatriptan between 0.5 and 4 hours (p = ns). Median SPIDs increased almost identically up to 2 hours. Thereafter, median SPIDs for placebo remained practically constant, whereas for sumatriptan, the improvement continued. At 4 hours, the median SPID for sumatriptan was 2.4 times as high as for placebo. However, the maximum differences between median SPIDs at 4 hours (38.5, 95% CI, -75.8 to 57.5; Wilcoxon signed rank test, p = 0.4) or at any other point were not statistically significant. Of the 23 children, 13 preferred sumatriptan and 2 placebo (sign test, p = 0.004). The failure of this and previous controlled studies suggests that the response of children to sumatriptan may be different from adults.",4,E
9117375,Responsiveness of the trigeminovascular system to nitroglycerine in cluster headache patients.,"Adult; Brain; Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide; Cluster Headache; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neurons, Afferent; Nitroglycerin; Nociceptors; Trigeminal Nerve","Fanciullacci, M; Alessandri, M; Sicuteri, R; Marabini, S","Nitroglycerine is known to induce a headache attack in cluster headache patients, which is indistinguishable from a spontaneous attack. It has recently been suggested that a release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from peripheral terminals of trigeminal nociceptive neurons, which supply cephalic blood vessels, underlies symptoms of cluster headache. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the provocative action of nitroglycerine in cluster headache is due, at least in part, to activation of the trigeminovascular system. Nineteen subjects suffering from episodic cluster headache participated in the study. Eleven of them were in an active period, whilst the others were in remission at the time of the study. CGRP-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) was measured in blood samples from the extracerebral circulation before and after the sublingual administration of nitroglycerine. Baseline CGRP-LI plasma levels were higher (P < 0.05) in the patients who were in an active period. Only in these patients did nitroglycerine induce an attack, which was preceded by a latent period with a mean duration of 27 +/- 3 min. When compared with the baseline, a significant (P < 0.01) increase in plasma CGRP-LI was detected at the peak of the provoked attack; no such increase was detected during the latent period, or at the onset of the attack. The results of this study suggests that the provocative action of nitroglycerine in cluster headache is due, at least in part, to activation of the trigeminovascular system. This mechanism seems to be slow and unrelated to the well-known rapidly occurring vasodilator effects of the drug. Finally, activation of the trigeminovascular system only occurs in those patients already in an active cluster headache period who also have high basal CGRP-LI plasma levels. This suggests that a hyperactivity of trigeminal nociceptive fibres could make the trigeminovascular system of these patients sensitive to the triggering action of nitroglycerine.",3,E

As angiographic studies have shown that the prototypic 5-HT1D/1B-receptor agonist sumatriptan can cause coronary artery constriction in patients with mild coronary artery disease, we have compared the contractile effects of rizatriptan on human isolated coronary artery with those of sumatriptan and 5-HT. Two different experimental protocols were used. In Study 1 (to avoid agonist desensitisation and interaction effects), arterial segments were exposed to a single agonist (either 5-HT, sumatriptan or rizatriptan) and in Study 2 each arterial segment was exposed to all three agonists with randomised first exposure to sumatriptan or rizatriptan. In both these studies the maximum contractions evoked by sumatriptan and rizatriptan were found to be smaller than those evoked by 5-HT, and the maximum contraction evoked by rizatriptan was significantly smaller than that for sumatriptan.",E,2
9137840,Preventive treatment of migraine: an overview.,Humans; Migraine Disorders,"Silberstein, S D","The pharmacologic treatment of migraine may be acute (abortive, symptomatic) or preventive (prophylactic). Most migraine preventive medications were designed to treat other disorders (e.g., propranolol for hypertension, valproate for epilepsy, etc.). Preventive medication is usually given daily for months or years; however, treatment can be episodic, subacute, or chronic. The medications can be divided into two major categories: (i) Alternatives of high efficacy, which include beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and divalproex, and of lower efficacy, which include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and (ii) second-line choices of high efficacy, which include methysergide and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The choice of preventive treatment depends on the individual drug's efficacy and side effects, the patient's wants, needs, and response to prior treatment, and the presence of any comorbid or coexistent disease.",E,E

We used aggregated data for ergotamine drugs.; Sumatriptan constituted 46% of the total amount of defined daily doses (DDD) sold and 94% of the total pharmacy retail price expenses in the drug-group studied. In total, 43389 users of sumatriptan were identified who presented 340148 prescriptions, corresponding to 2.2 million DDD of sumatriptan. The quarterly consumption increased by 50% during the study period. Tablets accounted for 92% of consumption. The 1 year period prevalence of use of sumatriptan among persons 16 years and older was 7.8 per 1000 in 1995 with a female to male prevalence ratio of 3.8:1. Use was most common in the age interval 35-54 years. Regional differences in use, which were not large, were positively correlated to the degree of urbanization. The incidence of use of sumatriptan was estimated at 3.6 per 1000 person-years. The intensity of use of sumatriptan varied greatly with 1.1% of patients (n = 507) using 60 DDD or more within 30 days at some time during the observation period. Long-term high use of tablets was common in this group.; We conclude that sumatriptan had a considerable impact on the treatment of migraine with prescription drugs in Denmark. The underlying reasons for high use of the drug in a smaller fraction of the patients deserve further study.",8,E

A reduction in total pain was found 120 min post injection in the sumatriptan group. Most patients, however, described the medication as ineffective overall, despite significant pain score reduction. The temporary improvement of pain scores with the active drug was thought to be too small to be of any clinical benefit, but suggests that vascular or neurogenic mechanisms may be involved in the aetiology of AFP. Sumatriptan is not an appropriate therapeutic option for patients with AFP, but could prove a valuable drug in experimental clinical pharmacology.",4,E
9169967,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced serotonin syndrome: review.,Antidepressive Agents; Autonomic Nervous System Diseases; Drug Interactions; Humans; Mental Disorders; Neuromuscular Diseases; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors; Syndrome,"Lane, R; Baldwin, D","The selective pharmacology of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) results in a lower potential for pharmacodynamic drug interactions relative to other antidepressants such as the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). However, the SSRIs have been implicated in the development of the serotonin syndrome--a potentially life-threatening complication of treatment with psychotropic drugs. The syndrome is produced most often by the concurrent use of two or more drugs that enhance central nervous system serotonin activity and often goes unrecognized because of the varied and nonspecific nature of its clinical features. The serotonin syndrome is characterized by alterations in cognition (disorientation, confusion), behavior (agitation, restlessness), autonomic nervous system function (fever, shivering, diaphoresis, diarrhea), and neuromuscular (ataxia, hyperreflexia, myoclonus) activity. The difference between this syndrome and the occurrence of adverse effects caused by serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone is the clustering of the signs and symptoms, their severity, and their duration. There are important pharmacokinetic interactions between SSRIs and other serotonergic drugs due principally to their effects on the cytochrome P450(CYP) isoenzymes, the potential for which varies widely amongst the SSRI group, which may increase the likelihood of a pharmacodynamic interaction. The exceptionally long washout period required after fluoxetine discontinuation may cause additional problems and/or inconvenience. Patients with serotonin syndrome usually respond to discontinuation of drug therapy and supportive care alone, but they may also require treatment with antiserotonergic agent such as cyproheptadine, methysergide, and/or propranolol. To reduce the occurrence, morbidity, and mortality of the serotonin syndrome, it must be both prevented by prudent pharmacotherapy and given prompt recognition when it is present.",E,E

The influence of this procedure on serotonergic pathways of pain was monitored by means of study of serotonin binding to mononuclear cells before and after the treatment for both subgroups. All of the treated 14 chronic cluster headache patients completed the study. In the subgroup treated with the placebo, no particular modifications on the number of attacks and of analgesic consumption as well as no change in the specific binding curve of serotonin to mononuclear cells were observed, whereas in the subgroup treated with HBO2 the clinical effectiveness and the appearance of plateau in the binding curves indicated that the oxygen therapy could act through serotonergic pathways.",3,E

Nineteen volunteer female migraineurs, age range 33 to 62 years, at low risk for ischemic heart disease were included. All bad undergone previous treatment with oral or intravenous sumatriptan. Patients were recruited by advertisement and referral from local neurology specialists. Each volunteer underwent two scanning sessions. On each occasion, a baseline dynamic 13NH3 PET scan was acquired followed by a 13NH3 PET scan 10 minutes after subcutaneous injection of placebo or 6 mg of sumatriptan. Regional MP was measured in five myocardial regions using the Patlak system of image analysis. The mean % change from baseline (+/-SD) in global MP after placebo was +9.5% +/- 18.0 and after sumatriptan was +6.6% +/- 18.8 (repeated measures ANOVA for treatment effect p = 0.56). There were no significant differences in MP changes from baseline observed in any of the five myocardial regions (treatment p = 0.32 to 0.84).

We have studied recovery curves of the R2 component of the blink reflex after conditioning by supraorbital or index finger stimuli in 10 episodic cluster headache (CH) patients during a cluster period and in 10 healthy controls. There was no significant change of R2 threshold, latency or area in CH patients. After paired supraorbital stimuli, R2 recovered more rapidly in patients on the symptomatic side. After index stimulations, R2 recovery was more rapid on both symptomatic and non-symptomatic sides in patients compared to controls. Naloxone (0.4 mg) i.v. in two subjects partially reversed the R2 suppression induced by index finger stimuli. The unilateral decrease of R2 inhibition after a segmental supraorbital stimulus most likely reflects sensitisation in the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Whether the latter is due to irritation of the ophthalmic nerve within the cavernous sinus region, which is thought to be pivotal in CH pathogenesis, remains to be proven. In addition, we propose that the bilateral deficit of R2 inhibition after an extrasegmental exteroceptive stimulus might reflect hypoactivity of reticular nuclei, possibly because of reduced central opioid activity.",2,E

Disposition was studied by administration of a 25 mg capsule, labelled with 100 microCi [14C]-zolmitriptan, to five men and one woman on a single occasion.; Zolmitriptan was well tolerated by both i.v. and oral routes. Adverse events were mostly mild, consistent with earlier studies and characteristic of this class of drug. Reports were similar in nature and number after both oral and i.v. dosing. Mean +/- s.d. oral bioavailability was 0.49 +/- 0.24 (0.38 +/- 0.16 in men and 0.60 +/- 0.28 in women). After oral dosing, Cmax and AUC values in women were approximately double those in men. Relative to zolmitriptan concentrations, metabolite concentrations were higher after oral dosing than after i.v., and higher in men compared with women. Half-life was significantly longer after oral dosing (mean 22%, 95% CI 6-35%).

Two independent double-blind, randomized clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan suppositories following ascending single doses (four different dose levels) and multiple doses. In the four-period, crossover, single-dose study, 24 healthy male subjects were randomized to receive a suppository containing 12.5, 25, 50, or 100 mg on separate occasions 3-14 days apart. The suppositories were generally well tolerated; transient asthenia, drowsiness, and headache were the most frequently reported adverse events, and these were not dose-related. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of sumatriptan were proportional to dose from 25 to 100 mg; area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC infinity) values were proportional to dose except at the highest doses, when they were greater than those predicted from lower doses.

Area under the plasma sumatriptan concentration versus time curve (AUC infinity) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) increased with the dose. Dose proportionality was demonstrated between 5 and 10 mg but not across the dose range 5-20 mg. Time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) was variable due to multiple peaking. The elimination half-life (t1/2), approximately 2 h, was unaffected by the magnitude of dose. In the two-period, multiple-dose, crossover study, 12 healthy adult male and female subjects were randomized to receive either sumatriptan hemisulphate 20 mg or placebo, administered intranasally as a spray three times a day for 4 days. The two dosing periods were separated by 3 to 14 days. Multiple doses of sumatriptan were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events occurring or withdrawals due to adverse events. All patients reported a mild to moderate drug-related disturbance of taste. Nasal examinations remained normal, and olfactory function was unaffected. The AUC over the first 8 h following dosing (AUC8) and fraction of the dose excreted in the urine (fe; 6.2% vs 3.6%) were similar on Days 1 and 4.

SU is also able to produce an increase in GH response to growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) in prepubertal children. In this study we investigated whether SU administration influences GHRH-induced GH secretion in 8 acromegalics, and 6 age-matched normal volunteers, as a control group. We evaluated the effects of SU (6 mg s.c.) or placebo (PL) administration on GHRH (1 microgram/kg bw i.v.)-induced GH and PRL secretion. After SU priming the GH response to GHRH did not changed in acromegalics, but significantly decreased in controls, in comparison with that observed after PL plus GHRH. In acromegalics, no difference in GH peak was seen after SU plus GHRH and PL plus GHRH, nor was any difference seen in AUC between tests. In controls, no difference was seen in GH peaks, while SU priming significantly (P < 0.03) decreased the AUC 90-120 min of GH after GHRH administration. In acromegalics, SU did not change the slight GHRH-induced increase in PRL levels. Our study documents that 5-HT1 D receptors do not interfere with GHRH-stimulated GH secretion in acromegalic subjects. In normals, SU is able to decrease GH response to GHRH, thus confirming that 5-HT1D receptors are able to modulate GH secretion in normals.",4,E

The patients were diagnosed with migraine based on IHS criteria but individual migraine attacks treated in the study were physician diagnosed; not necessarily required to meet IHS criteria. A re-analysis of the treatment response to open label sumatriptan (6 mg sc) indicated that 43 patients had treated at least one migraine that fulfilled IHS criteria for tension-type headache. Analysis of this population revealed they treated 232 headaches. Of these headaches, 114 were classified per IHS criteria as migraine; 76 as tension-type; and 42 as non-IHS migraine (not classifiable as IHS migraine or IHS tension-type headache). Of the 114 migraines, a positive response to sumatriptan occurred in 109 (96%) cases; of the 76 tension-types, 73 responded to sumatriptan (97%); of the 42 non-IHS migraine, 40 (95%) responded to sumatriptan.

Patients were treated for 3 attacks or 3 months and then crossed over. Primary clinical efficacy was defined as a reduction in headache severity on a four-point self-rating scale from severe (3) or moderate (2) to mild (1) or none (0), or mild (1) to none (0). Efficacy was evaluated 2 h after the administration of subcutaneous and 4 h after the administration of oral sumatriptan. Subcutaneous sumatriptan was significantly more effective than oral sumatriptan in relieving headache (over all three attacks 78% vs 61% improvement), improving clinical disability (55% vs 41% improvement) and relieving nausea (69% vs 53%), vomiting (72% vs 32%) and phono- or photophobia (67% vs 49%). Median time to recurrence was shorter after subcutaneous (12.5 h) than after oral sumatriptan (18 h); the number of patients experiencing a recurrence was similar. Patients reported more adverse events after subcutaneous sumatriptan (1.32 per attack) than after the oral form (0.85 per attack), but all adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity and of short duration. Patient opinion was more often positive after subcutaneous sumatriptan. These results may be useful in counselling patients to choose between the available marketed formulations of sumatriptan.",3,E

Eighty-eight patients completed the blinded study and 63 patients completed the open study. Both studies were of crossover design with patients undertaking a 4 week run-in period prior to a 12-week treatment period. Following a 4-week washout period patients commenced a second 12-week treatment period on the alternative treatment regimen. All breakthrough attacks were treated with 100 mg oral sumatriptan with an optional 2 doses available to treat any recurrence within 24 h of taking dose 1. Pizotifen was built up to a final daily dose of 1.5 mg over a 2-week period and patients remained on this dose for a further 10 weeks. Patients in the blinded study were given matching placebo tablets for one of the two treatment periods. The efficacy of sumatriptan was not affected by pizotifen. The median of the monthly attack rate experienced by patients was slightly lower whilst patients were on pizotifen and sumatriptan than while on placebo prophylaxis and sumatriptan or sumatriptan alone; study 1, 3.5 vs 3.9 attacks per month (p = 0.008); study 2, 2.9 vs. 3.2 attacks per month (p = 0.23). Also, while on pizotifen and sumatriptan more patients had a greater proportion of their time in the study migraine-free. From the results of these studies it does not appear that pizotifen reduces migraine severity; regardless of the treatment regimen the initial headache severity of most attacks was moderate. Weight gains experienced by patients while on pizotifen and sumatriptan were greater than the weight gains experienced while on placebo prophylaxis and sumatriptan or sumatriptan alone (period 1); study 1, 2.6 vs. 1.0 kg (p = 0.002); study 2, 1.6 vs. -0.8 kg (p < 0.0001). The combination of pizotifen and sumatriptan did not result in any additional adverse events other than those usually seen with each medication alone. In these studies, where the average number of migraine attacks was around 4 per month, the benefits conferred by pizotifen were at the expense of the adverse events associated with the drug, particularly weight gain. Therefore the clinical benefit of treatment with pizotifen for patients who have less than 4 attacks per month should be carefully reviewed as acute treatment with sumatriptan may be the most appropriate treatment. Pizotifen may be better reserved for those patients who have 4 of more attacks per month.",3,E

Therefore, it has been considered as a possible agent in the pathogenesis of headache. Histamine desensitization is used for the treatment of cluster and other chronic headaches like migrains with interparoxysmal headache. However, it is unknown whether desensitization plays a role in headache improvement. Since a disfunction of the opioid system has been considered responsible for idiopathic headache and since low beta-endorphin levels have been demonstrated in some idiopathic headaches, particularly in migraine with interparoxysmal headache, we planned this study to verify if histamine therapy is able to modify serum beta-endorphin concentrations. For this purpose, we studied 24 healthy control subjects and 36 patients suffering from migraine with interparoxysmal headache refractory to conventional therapies. Patients showed baseline serum beta-endorphin levels significantly lower than healthy control subjects and treatment with histamine for 15 days increased their beta-endorphin concentrations. We believe that histamine treatment can activate the opioid endogenous system. However, the therapeutic effect of histamine remains to be verified by evaluating the correlation between beta-endorphin levels and headache improvement.",3,E

Our open, prospective clinical study was performed at the outpatient department of a Swedish university clinic. There were 19 male and one female subjects, 34 to 68 years old, suffering from cluster headache. We measured the subcutaneous tissue depth by ultrasound. Subjects performed four self-injections of sumatriptan, two in the thigh and two in the gluteal area. We evaluated the subcutaneous tissue depth from the skin surface to the muscle fascia, the effect on headache, side effects, and patient preference regarding the injection site. Subcutaneous tissue depth laterally in the thigh was 2 to 12 mm (median, 4 mm) and in the gluteal area was 34 to 68 mm (median, 45 mm). The needle of the self-injector protrudes 5 to 6 mm. Forty thigh and 39 gluteal injections were recorded. The effect on headache was equal. Following injection in thigh the patients experienced more bleeding (p < 0.001, chi 2); local pain (p < 0.05, chi 2); and a feeling of oppression in the head, neck, and chest area (p < 0.05, chi 2); compared with injections in the gluteal area. Fifteen patients preferred the gluteal area as the injection site after the study, two patients had no preference, and three preferred the thigh. When using the self-injector in the lateral aspect of the thigh, intramuscular injection is liable to occur frequently in male patients. This may explain the differences in local and general side effects observed in this study. The upper lateral quadrant of the gluteal area is a more suitable injection site for male, and some female, patients when using the sumatriptan self-injector.",E,E

We recruited 200 consecutive patients, with an established history of migraine without aura, presenting at a headache center. The patients were instructed to take half a 100-mg sumatriptan tablet for their next migraine attack, and to record details of their headache in a diary. The primary outcome of the study was headache relief from one migraine attack. Attacks were moderately intense (46%), moderate to severe (7%), or severe (47%). Total or partial benefit at 2 hours from the 50-mg dose was reported by 140 of 200 patients (70%). Thirty-six patients received no benefit from half a tablet, and 24 did not take sumatriptan, preferring their habitual medication. Side effects were few, mild, and short lasting. We conclude that the 50-mg oral dose is generally effective for migraine without aura attacks of both moderate and severe intensity and recommend this dose for all such patients. If, however, sumatriptan is ineffective at that dose it can be increased to a maximum of 100 mg.",6,E

Both drugs produced small degrees of peripheral vasoconstriction, including increases in diastolic blood pressure and blood flow velocity and decreases in arterial diameter and toe-arm systolic pressure gradient. These effects were generally additive with the combination but of no clinical importance. There were no significant changes in cardiac output, stroke volume heart rate or ECG.

The drug differs from presently available members of this drug class in that it combines 5HT1B/1D receptor partial agonist activity with robust oral pharmacokinetics and an ability to inhibit trigeminovascular activation centrally as well as peripherally in preclinical studies. Consistent with its selectivity for 5HT1B/1D receptors, zolmitriptan produces constriction of various isolated blood vessels, most notably cranial arteries. In anaesthetized animals, these vascular effects manifest as a selective constriction of cranial arterio-venous anastomoses resulting in a redistribution of carotid arterial blood flow. This effect is produced without significant effects on heart rate, blood pressure or blood flow to the brain, heart or lungs. Zolmitriptan also inhibits trigeminal-evoked increases in cerebral blood flow in anaesthetized cats and blocks trigeminal-evoked plasma protein extravasation in the dura of guinea-pigs. These actions are consistent with a pre-junctional inhibition of neuropeptide release from perivascular afferents of the trigeminal nerve, as confirmed by independent studies showing that zolmitriptan blocks elevations of calcitonin-gene-related peptide in jugular venous blood during electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. In all of these effects, zolmitriptan is three to four times more potent than sumatriptan, but produces the same maximum response. Zolmitriptan crosses the intact blood-brain barrier to inhibit trigeminovascular activation in the brainstem. This was shown initially by the ability of the drug to block a brainstem reflex provoking vasoactive intestinal peptide release from the VIIth cranial (facial) nerve during trigeminal stimulation. Subsequent ex vivo autoradiography confirmed that intravenously injected [3H]zolmitriptan labels a discrete population of cells in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and nucleus tractus solitarius. Direct evidence for a central neuromodulatory effect of zolmitriptan was provided by electrophysiological experiments which clearly demonstrated that the drug inhibits the excitability of cells in the TNC after systemic administration. This novel pre-clinical profile not only distinguishes zolmitriptan from sumatriptan, but raises intriguing questions about the clinical relevance of a dual action. Studies to date show that zolmitriptan indeed modulates cranial sensory processing in humans, yet central side-effects are no different from sumatriptan. This property may account for the remarkable consistency in clinical efficacy observed in clinical trials.",E,E

Four randomized, placebo-controlled studies (total 2480 patients) were performed; data from two of these trials established that a 2.5 mg dose was on the shoulder of the dose-response curve (2-h headache response rate 64%), showing similar efficacy to the 5 mg dose (67%). In this program, the efficacy of zolmitriptan was not influenced by the pretreatment headache duration; the presence of aura preceding the headache, migraine associated with menses or migraine upon awakening; or by concomitant use of oral contraceptives or antidepressants. In addition, zolmitriptan 5 mg proved consistently effective in the treatment of multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year. Zolmitriptan reduced the incidence of nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, reduced impairment of normal activity and demonstrated positive effects on patients' quality of life. Thus, zolmitriptan is a highly effective acute oral antimigraine therapy, with 2.5 mg providing the optimal balance between efficacy and tolerability.",I,E

Overall, subjects received almost 50,000 doses; 97% of exposures were at doses > or = 2.5 mg. In the clinical pharmacology studies, the overall incidence of subject exposures experiencing at least one adverse event was 52% with zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (28% with placebo). In placebo-controlled studies, the overall incidence of patients with at least one adverse event was dose-dependent for zolmitriptan over the 1-15 mg dose range, e.g. 42% and 46% with 1 and 2.5 mg, respectively and 58% with 5 mg (29% with placebo). Only four serious adverse events attributable to zolmitriptan were reported. In a long-term study, during which 2,058 outpatients treated a total of 31,579 migraine attacks with either one or two zolmitriptan 5 mg doses over a period of up to 1 year, the number of attacks associated with at least one adverse event was similar after one (26%) and two (24%) doses. The majority (59%) of the adverse events reported in this study (59%) occurred within 2 h of dosing, were predominantly mild (59%) or moderate (35%) in intensity, of < or = 4 h duration (58%), required no further action (94%). In placebo-controlled studies, the percentage of patients who reported severe adverse events was similar with zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (4%) and placebo (5%). The most frequently reported adverse events with zolmitriptan in the placebo-controlled clinical studies were asthenia, heaviness (other than chest or neck), dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, paresthesia and warm sensations. The type and severity of the adverse events was not influenced by gender (although the frequency of reported adverse events was higher in females, as was the case in the placebo group), age, presence of aura prior to the attack, association of migraine with menstruation, concurrent medication, or by the addition of a second zolmitriptan dose. Zolmitriptan showed a similar tolerability profile in the long-term study, in which a low withdrawal rate due to adverse events of 8% was observed. Zolmitriptan was not associated with an increased frequency of central nervous system-related adverse events in a comparative study of sumatriptan, despite pre-clinical and neurophysiological evidence of a dual peripheral and central action of zolmitriptan. Moreover, zolmitriptan doses of 5-20 mg produced no statistically significant effects on objective assessments of psychometric function. Zolmitriptan had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure (even in patients with controlled mild to moderate hypertension or impaired renal function), ECGs (e.g. there was no evidence of ischemic events) or clinical chemistry, hematological or urinalysis measurements. In summary, zolmitriptan is well tolerated, particularly at the recommended dose of 2.5 mg. Zolmitriptan has a well-defined dose-response with 2.5 mg proving highly effective and optimizing the benefit/risk ratio of treatment. Thus, zolmitriptan is well suited as an acute oral treatment for migraine in the outpatient setting.",I,E

Chronic treatments of methysergide and propranolol, drugs exerting antagonist action at 5-HT receptors, induced a significant amelioration in 256M sufferers. On the contrary, chronic treatments of ergotamine and sumatriptan, both provided with a 5-HT1 agonist activity, induced a worsening of M in 134 M sufferers. The M worsening was paralleled by an increase in consumption of analgesic drugs. Discussion concerns the effects of the chronically given 5-HT agonists and antagonists as well as the possible receptor mechanism underlying ""craving for serotonin"" in severe M.

There was a significant positive correlation between plasma levels of 311C90 and ASF slope changes. Sumatriptan and lorazepam had little effect, but dexfenfluramine produced a significant ASF slope decrease. 311C90 is able to modify a CNS activity that is modulated by serotonin, i.e. the IDAP. This effect is probably the consequence of its superior lipophilicity compared to sumatriptan and of activation of prejunctional 5HT1B/D autoreceptors, which lowers central serotonin release and thus the preactivation level of sensory cortices.",4,E

The duration of the migrating motor complex cycle was shortened at the expense of phase 2. After sumatriptan, plasma somatostatin concentrations were reduced and gastric phase 3s were suppressed, although median motilin concentrations and the occurrence of plasma motilin peaks were not affected. Phase 3s of the migrating motor complex preceding sumatriptan were associated with motilin peaks, while phase 3s after sumatriptan were not. Furthermore, pretreatment with sumatriptan prevented the induction of a gastric phase 3 by the motilin agonist erythromycin.; Administration of the 5HT1P receptor agonist sumatriptan induces a premature intestinal phase 3, suppresses gastric phase 3s, prevents induction of a gastric phase 3 by erythromycin, and reduces plasma somatostatin concentrations.",2,E

It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents the so called 'migraine generator'. To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers, using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the migraine patients. A small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Increases of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were found bilaterally in the insula, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum. Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state. The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however, suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain as such, rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster headache.",E,E

Patients used a sumatriptan suppository (12.5 mg or 25 mg) or placebo at home for the treatment of a moderate or severe migraine attack and those who experienced headache recurrence within 24 hours of dosing had the option to repeat the dose. By 2 hours post-dose, 68% of patients in the sumatriptan 25 mg group and 47% of patients in the sumatriptan 12.5 mg group compared with 25% of placebo patients achieved headache relief. Relief rates 2 hours post-dose for nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia were similar to those reported 2 hours post-dose for headache. Post hoc review of the recurrence data showed that administration of a second suppository was effective in alleviating recurrent headache in over 80% of the sumatriptan-treated patients experiencing recurrence. No serious or unusual adverse events were reported, and the pattern and incidence of adverse events did not vary as a function of dose.

Patients who had previously participated in placebo-controlled zolmitriptan studies were recruited. A total of 2058 patients treated 31,579 migraine attacks (average 15 per patient), for up to 1 year. Twenty-six percent of attacks treated with a single zolmitriptan 5-mg dose were associated with at least one adverse event (24% treated with two doses). The most frequent adverse events included asthenia (14% of patients), nausea (12%), somnolence (10%), dizziness (11%), and paresthesia (11%). The rank order of the most common adverse events was not influenced by sex, age, or number of zolmitriptan doses taken and was similar between attacks 1 and 45. The majority of adverse events (59%) occurred within 2 hours of dosing, were of either mild (59%) or moderate (35%) intensity, of 4 hours' duration or less (67%), and required no further action (94%). Following an initial 5-mg dose of zolmitriptan, the 2-hour headache response rate (reduction in headache pain from moderate or severe before treatment to mild or no pain at 2 hours posttreatment) was 81% in patients treating moderate and severe attacks (19,639 of 24,161). Patients were pain-free at 2 hours in 55% of all attacks (16,510 of 29,808). The efficacy of zolmitriptan was not influenced by age, sex, weight, use of prophylactic antimigraine medication, or association of attacks with menstruation. Analysis of the overall population and a subgroup who treated 30 or more migraine attacks showed that zolmitriptan was consistently effective across attacks. Overall, 67% of patients who treated five or more attacks reported zolmitriptan to be effective in 80% to 100% of attacks. Zolmitriptan produced meaningful migraine relief and improvement in normal activity impairment in 73% and 78% of moderate and severe attacks, respectively. Patients treated recurrence of moderate or severe headache with a second zolmitriptan dose in 32% of attacks which responded to the first dose within 2 hours. Where required, a second zolmitriptan 5-mg dose for treatment of recurrence produced a headache response rate of 90% at 2 hours postdose. Thus, zolmitriptan 5 mg (plus an optional second 5-mg dose for treatment of recurrence) is well tolerated and effective in the acute treatment of multiple migraine attacks over periods up to 1 year.",I,E

This multinational double-blind trial (N = 1003) in which patients treated up to three migraine attacks with sumatriptan 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, or placebo, with a second independently randomized dose for headache recurrence, evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of three doses of sumatriptan. The results demonstrate that all doses of sumatriptan were superior (P < 0.05) to placebo in reducing moderate or severe predose headache to mild or no headache 4 hours postdose for each of the three treated attacks; sumatriptan 50 mg and 100 mg were each superior (P < 0.05) to sumatriptan 25 mg 4 hours postdose for two of three attacks. Sumatriptan (all doses) was similarly effective at relieving nausea and photophobia or phonophobia or both and at reducing clinical disability. Headache recurrence was experienced by similar proportions of patients across treatment groups (35% to 48% after placebo; 26% to 39% after sumatriptan). Relief of recurrent headache 2 hours after the second dose of study medication occurred in greater percentages of patients using any dose of sumatriptan compared with patients using placebo to treat recurrence. The incidence of adverse events with 25-mg and 50-mg sumatriptan tablets was similar to the incidence with placebo and lower than the incidence with 100-mg sumatriptan tablets. These data provide the first demonstration from a large well-controlled clinical trial that both the 50- and 100-mg doses are more effective than the 25-mg dose and that the 50-mg dose is associated with a lower incidence of adverse events than the 100-mg dose.",I,E

Sumatriptan, an agonist of 5-HT1-like receptors, has proven effective in the treatment of cluster headache attacks. There are clear clinical similarities between chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and cluster headache. A natural consequence of these considerations would be to establish whether chronic paroxysmal hemicrania also responds similarly to sumatriptan. Since hemicrania continua is another unilateral headache responsive to indomethacin, it would be meaningful to also include hemicrania continua in such a study. Sumatriptan, 6 mg subcutaneous, was tried in an open fashion in 7 patients (6 women and 1 man) with chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and 7 patients (5 women and 2 men) with hemicrania continua. In chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, the mean interval between the last three attacks prior to sumatriptan treatment (40 +/- 23 minutes) was not statistically different from the mean interval between the three attacks subsequent to sumatriptan treatment of an attack (32 +/- 20 minutes). In none of the patients did the mean duration of the ""test attack"" decrease as compared to the attacks antedating the test attack (25 +/- 11 minutes and 19 +/- 9 minutes, respectively) (P = 0.027, Wilcoxon). In 2 patients with chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, placebo (saline) administration did not lead to any change in the interval between attacks. There was a mild, but statistically significant reduction in visual analog scale values for headache intensity in hemicrania continua (P = 0.04, Wilcoxon). There was no clear, i.e., clinically meaningful, reduction in visual analog scale values in any particular patient with hemicrania continua. Taken together, these results seem to show that sumatriptan is of no benefit in chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, but may have a partial efficacy in hemicrania continua. However, the latter effect is clinically unimportant. This minor difference in regard to the clinical effect may, nevertheless, be of some interest pathogenetically, indicating minor differences between the two headaches. The lack of sumatriptan effect in chronic paroxysmal hemicrania clearly and markedly strengthens the nonalignment concept in regard to chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and cluster headache.",4,E

It is an effective treatment for acute migraine attacks and the injectable form has also shown efficacy in the treatment of cluster headaches. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, sumatriptan, administered subcutaneously, orally, intranasally or rectally was significantly more effective than placebo in relieving migraine headache and in producing resolution or reduction of other symptoms associated with migraine, including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia. Improvements in clinical disability were also significantly greater after sumatriptan than after placebo. Headache recurred in 21 to 57% of patients who received oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan, but most patients responded to a second dose of the drug. Results of comparative trials showed that subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg was significantly more effective than either patients' usual antimigraine treatments or intranasal dihydroergotamine mesylate 1 mg in relieving migraine headache. Subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg and subcutaneous dihydroergotamine mesylate 1 mg provided similarly effective migraine relief, but the headache recurrence rate was significantly higher after sumatriptan than after this formulation of dihydroergotamine mesylate. Response rates achieved after oral sumatriptan were similar to those reported after treatment with oral naratriptan, rizatriptan or lysine acetylsalicylate plus metoclopramide. Treatment of acute migraine attacks with oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan leads to less loss of workplace productivity than other antimigraine therapies. Several pharmacoeconomic analyses showed that gains in workplace productivity in sumatriptan recipients ranged from 12.1 to 89.8 hours per patient per year. Significant improvements from baseline in overall health-related quality-of-life scores were also experienced by sumatriptan recipients. Sumatriptan is generally well tolerated. Nausea, vomiting, malaise and fatigue are the most common adverse events with oral sumatriptan. Injection site reactions occur in 10 to 40% of patients receiving the drug subcutaneously. A bitter taste at the back of the mouth occurs frequently after intranasal administration. Serious adverse events occur in about 0.14% of patients with migraine treated with sumatriptan. As the drug is associated with the rare development of cardiovascular effects, it is contraindicated in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.; Despite its relatively high acquisition cost, reductions in lost workplace productivity experienced by patients treated with sumatriptan may result in savings in the overall cost of migraine to society. Thus, sumatriptan is a useful first- or second-line treatment option for patients with moderate or severe migraine.",I,E

For their first treatment with oral sumatriptan, patients were evaluated on their response to 25-mg tablets and the total number of tablets taken. For their second treatment, patients were evaluated on their response to sumatriptan, number of 25-mg tablets taken, and dosage prescribed for future migraines.; [table see text] After the second treatment, 41 patients (40%) continued therapy with 25-mg tablets, 54 (53%) were prescribed 50-mg tablets, 2 patients (2%) were prescribed two 50-mg tablets, and 5 patients (5%) were prescribed injectable sumatriptan. Seventy patients had previously used injectable sumatriptan, while 34 had not previously used sumatriptan. There were no significant differences in their response to oral sumatriptan.; Oral sumatriptan was effective in clinical practice at doses of 25 and 50 mg. The majority of patients required more than one 25-mg tablet for a migraine attack, reflecting both inadequacy of dosing for some migraines and recurrence of headache, yet 40% of patients continued on treatment with 25-mg tablets. There were no significant differences in response to therapy in patients being switched from injectable to oral sumatriptan compared with those initiating therapy with oral sumatriptan. Both tablet strengths of oral sumatriptan are useful in clinical practice.",E,E

Although the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan nasal spray are documented, the consistency of response to sumatriptan nasal spray across patient subgroups and migraine subtypes of importance to the prescribing clinician have not been described. To provide this information, data from four randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies (Glaxo Wellcome protocol numbers S2B-340, S2B-341, S2B-342, and S2B-T50), conducted between January 1993 and December 1994, were pooled and retrospectively analyzed to determine whether the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan nasal spray vary with gender, ethnic origin, age, weight, migraine type, concomitant or prior medication use, or pretreatment headache duration. Two-thousand-three-hundred-and-ninety-five (2395) patients treated a moderate or severe migraine with study medication in the four studies. The results demonstrate that sumatriptan nasal spray 20 mg and 10 mg were effective and well tolerated in the acute treatment of migraine consistently across a variety of patient and migraine subgroups. No clinically significant differences in headache relief or adverse event rates were observed for any of the subgroups examined. Approximately two-thirds of patients treated with sumatriptan nasal spray 20 mg compared with approximately one-third of placebo-treated patients reported headache relief 2 h postdose regardless of patient or migraine subgroup. The relationship between active treatment and placebo with respect to the overall incidence of adverse events also did not differ between patient or migraine subgroups. There is no evidence based on this analysis that sumatriptan nasal spray dosage should be adjusted in any of the subgroups examined.",I,E

Zolmitriptan has vasoconstrictor activity in cerebral vessels and may cause slight elevations of blood pressure in subjects without hypertension. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zolmitriptan (5, 10, and 20 mg) were evaluated in 16 patients with mild to moderate hypertension (controlled by hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg once daily) and 17 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, four-period crossover study. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolites were dose proportional. Although area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) and maximum concentration (Cmax) were slightly higher in patients with hypertension at all doses, this was only statistically significant for AUC at the 20-mg dose. Differences between subjects with and without hypertension were not clinically significant. Zolmitriptan produced a small increase in blood pressure, but this was similar in subjects with and without hypertension and was of no clinical significance. Zolmitriptan was well tolerated in both groups. Zolmitriptan plasma concentrations were higher in women than in men, with higher values of AUC and Cmax and lower total clearance in women. These results indicate that zolmitriptan can be administered for treatment of migraine in patients with controlled hypertension without dose adjustment.",4,E

Consequently, changes in hepatic function may result in changes in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan. This open, parallel-group study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of a single 10-mg dose of zolmitriptan in healthy subjects and patients with hepatic impairment. A total of 37 participants entered and completed the study, including 10 healthy volunteers, 11 patients with moderate hepatic impairment, 10 patients with severe hepatic impairment without ascites, and 6 patients with severe hepatic impairment with ascites. The metabolism of zolmitriptan was reduced in patients with severe hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects, resulting in higher peak plasma concentrations (47%), increased exposure (226%), and prolonged half-life (157%). The changes were similar in the presence and absence of ascites. Smaller changes were observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Plasma concentrations of the three major metabolites of zolmitriptan were reduced in the patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment require no dosage adjustment, but the recommended daily intake of zolmitriptan may need to be reduced in patients with severe hepatic impairment.",2,E

To avoid bias, no specific adverse reactions were mentioned in the questionnaires.; Of the GPs, 589 (86%) responded; of the patients, 1202 (70%) responded. The most frequently reported suspected adverse reactions to sumatriptan reported by the GPs were dizziness (1.7%), nausea or vomiting (1.5%), drowsiness or sedation (1.4%), and chest pain (1.3%). The most frequently reported suspected adverse reactions by the patients were paraesthesia (11.7%), dizziness (8.1%), feeling of heaviness (8.0%), and chest pain (7.9%). Neither the GPs nor the patients reported serious adverse reactions.; First, patients experience significantly more suspected adverse reactions than are registered by their GP. In view of this higher frequency of reporting of suspected adverse reactions, postmarketing studies with data from GPs only, may underestimate the cumulative incidence of adverse reactions. Second, we conclude that it is possible to obtain useful additional information about adverse drug reactions from patients by sending them questionnaires via their GP.",I,E

In the current placebo-controlled study, we report constancy of safety and efficacy of rizatriptan for patients treating four discrete migraine attacks.; Patients with moderate or severe migraine (n = 473) were randomized to one of five sequence groups, in which each patient was to treat four migraine attacks. Patients in four groups received rizatriptan 10 mg for three of four attacks and placebo for the remaining attack. Patients in the fifth group received rizatriptan 10 mg for four attacks. Headache severity, functional disability, and migraine symptoms were measured immediately before dosing and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 hours postdose.; After the first attack, response rates were 77% for rizatriptan and 37% for placebo (p < 0.001). Similar efficacy of rizatriptan, ranging from a 75 to 80% response, was observed in each of the subsequent attacks with no evidence of tolerance to therapeutic effects. Most patients (93%) responded to rizatriptan 10 mg during the first or second attack. Adverse experiences were generally mild and transient, the most common being dizziness and somnolence.

If the patients satisfied the criteria for migraine, they were given subcutaneous sumatriptan for treating three migraine attacks. The patients were able to use the study medication under outpatient conditions. The therapeutic efficacy of the medicine was recorded in a headache diary. A total of 91 patients were included in the study at 22 practices in Germany. An average of four patients per practice were recruited. In the first migraine attack treated, headache improvement was experienced by 77.7% of the patients treated. In the second and third attacks an improvement was experienced by 93.5% and 89.8%, respectively. The results show that by optimizing diagnostic reliability with the aid of the computer program a high response rate can be achieved under practice conditions using the selective serotonin agonist sumatriptan. Since the computer program described permits a specific diagnosis, it improves the prospects of effective headache therapy in the individual patient. Thus treatment based on this approach can reduce inputs of time and money in migraine therapy.",E,E

Treatment was given within 5 min of onset of pain, and the time interval for the start and completeness of pain relief, provided these occurred within 15 min of administration, were recorded by the patient. After completion of the study, the patients were also asked to indicate which treatment they preferred, based on efficacy, side effects, and handling of the preparation. Forty-nine of the 52 treatments with injection resulted in complete relief of pain within 15 min, with a mean of 9.6 min. The remaining three attacks were reduced by a mean of 86.7% at 15 min. Only 7 of the 52 treatments with nasal spray in the nostril ipsilateral to pain resulted in complete relief within this time period, with a mean of 13.0 min. In 18 of these treatments pain was reduced by a mean of 42.2% at 15 min, whereas no effect on pain was obtained at this time in the remaining 27 treatments. The effect was almost identical when the nasal spray was administered in the nostril on the non-painful side. As an overall judgement, only 2 of the 26 patients preferred nasal spray to injection.

Two studies using this assay method were conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics, including absolute bioavailability, of 2.5 and 5 mg oral doses of zolmitriptan in men and women, the dose-proportionality of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg doses and the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of a 5 mg oral dose.; Two randomized, balanced, open-label, 4-period crossover studies were conducted in a total of 32 healthy volunteers. The first study determined the absolute bioavailability of 2.5 and 5 mg doses of zolmitriptan and compared the pharmacokinetics in men and women. The second study examined the dose-proportionality in pharmacokinetics after fasting doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg, and the effect of food on a 5 mg dose. Blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, clinical chemistry, haematology and adverse events were also monitored.; The mean (s.d.) absolute oral bioavailability was 0.41 (0.14 and 0.40) 0.09 after 2.5 mg and 0.48+/-0.14 and 0.36+/-0.07 after 5 mg in women and men, respectively. Without adjustment for bodyweight, plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan, but not 183C91, were higher in women than men. Mean (+/-s.d.) AUC was 32.7+/-10.1 and 60.2+/-26.8 ng ml(-1) h after 5 mg in men and women, respectively (95% CI for ratio 0.43-0.77). After 2.5 mg mean (+/-s.d.) AUC was 18.4+/-5.4 and 23.1+/-9.9 ng ml(-1) h in men and women, respectively (95% CI for ratio 0.61-1.09). However, these differences were of no clinical significance. Cmax and AUC of oral zolmitriptan were dose-proportional and there was a 13 and 16% fall in mean zolmitriptan Cmax and AUC, respectively, when administered after food. Adverse effects were minor, predominantly mild and transient, and there were no clinically significant effects on ECG, blood pressure, or laboratory parameters.; At therapeutic doses zolmitriptan has good oral bioavailability in healthy volunteers and has dose-proportional pharmacokinetics that are not affected by food to any clinically relevant extent.",4,E

Placebo (n = 10), atropine (15 micrograms/kg intravenous bolus plus 15 micrograms/kg/h over 30 minutes; n = 10), or sumatriptan (6 mg subcutaneously; n = 10) was administered, followed by infusion of erythromycin 40 mg or 200 mg.; After placebo, erythromycin 40 mg induced a premature activity front with gastric onset after 19.1 (1.7) minutes in all volunteers. After atropine, erythromycin 40 mg failed to induce a premature activity front during a 60 minute period in all volunteers (p < 0.001), while sumatriptan prevented the induction of a premature activity front during a 60 minute period in all but one volunteer (p < 0.005). The number of antral contractions and their mean amplitude in the 60 minutes after erythromycin 200 mg did not differ significantly after atropine or sumatriptan versus placebo.; The antral motor effects of erythromycin in humans are mediated via different pathways. The induction of a premature activity front is mediated through activation of an intrinsic cholinergic pathway, while the induction of enhanced antral contractile activity may be mediated via a pathway potentially involving activation of a muscular receptor.",3,E

Results of this study indicated that i.v. rizatriptan (0.5-5 mg) was well tolerated. The disposition kinetics of rizatriptan were linear for i.v. doses up to and including 2.5 mg. Relative to the 0.5 mg dose, geometric mean dose-adjusted AUC ratios were 1.04, 1.09, and 1.18 for 1, 2.5, and 5 mg doses, respectively. Apparent plasma clearance (Cl) ranged between 859 and 941 mL min(-1) from 0.5 to 2.5 mg, but dropped to slightly below 800 mL min(-1) for the 5 mg dose. Therefore, the elimination of rizatriptan appears somewhat dose dependent at the high end of this dose range. Mean plasma half-life (t1/2) was 1.5-2.2 h across all doses while mean residence time in the body (MRT) and steady state volume of distribution (Vss) of rizatriptan remained relatively invariant across doses. Urinary excretion of rizatriptan (Ue) ranged from 14.5 to 34.6% of dose.",4,E

MK-212, another non-selective 5-HT receptor agonist, does not seem to induce obsessive compulsive symptoms in OCD patients. The major pharmacological difference between mCPP and MK-212 is their affinity for the 5-HT(ID) receptor. The aim of this study was to explore the role of the 5-HT(ID) receptor in the pathophysiology of OCD, by using a challenge paradigm with the selective 5-HT(ID) receptor agonist sumatriptan (Imigran). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover challenge with sumatriptan (100 mg PO) was performed in 15 OCD patients. Neither the obsessive compulsive symptoms nor mood or anxiety symptoms changed significantly following sumatriptan administration as compared to placebo. Sumatriptan did induce a significant increase in plasma growth hormone (GH) levels. In the present study, no indication were found for the role of the 5-HT(ID) receptor in the pathophysiology of OCD. It should be noted, however, that sumatriptan does not readily pass the blood-brain barrier. Selective 5-HT(ID) receptors with better brain penetrating properties may shed more light on the role of this 5-HT receptor subtype in OCD.",4,E

If possible, controls were matched for age (within 5-year groups) and gender.; In a total of 74 cases and 55 controls symptom-limited exercise tests were performed. Besides a small difference in age, there were no differences in basic characteristics between cases and controls. Three cases had ST-depression on ECG during exercise. However, none of the variables measured during exercise testing differed significantly between cases and controls.; The prevalence of abnormal exercise tests in patients with sumatriptan-induced chest pain is low, and not statistically different from patients without chest pain after intake of sumatriptan. Routine performance of exercise testing in patients with sumatriptan-associated chest pain is not recommended.",E,E

A total of 296 patients fulfilling the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria for migraine were enrolled. In total, one or two migraine attacks were treated in 268 and 235 patients, respectively. The primary endpoint for the first treated attack was headache relief, with intensity decreasing from moderate or severe to mild or absent 2 h after drug intake. Usual secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed. A superiority of CM over EC was observed for both treated attacks for the main endpoint: success in 54 versus 36%, p = 0.003 for the first attack and 60 versus 44%, p = 0.02 for the second attack. CM was also significantly superior to EC during the first attack for complete headache relief (20 vs. 8%, p = 0.006), nausea (42 vs. 63%, p = 0. 007) and willingness to take the drug again (90 vs. 80%, p = 0.043). The global efficacy evaluation, rated by the investigators, was significantly more favorable to CM for both attacks (p = 0.001 for the first attack and p = 0.02 for the second). The patients' evaluation was significant for the first attack (p = 0.002). The global incidence of adverse events was 45% higher with EC, though not significant (32 vs. 22%, p = 0.075). They were most often unspecific and mild to moderate in intensity. Gastrointestinal side effects were significantly less frequent with CM than EC (7 vs. 21%, p = 0.001). Thus, CM is more effective and has a better gastrointestinal safety than EC in the acute treatment of migraine attacks.",3,E

Zolmitriptan acts both centrally and peripherally, therefore it is important to assess central nervous system effects. At single doses of 25-50 mg (up to 8 times the likely therapeutic dose), zolmitriptan can cause sedation; therefore, a study was designed to examine the dose-response. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, six-limb crossover study in 13 healthy volunteers compared the effects of single oral doses of zolmitriptan (5, 10, 15 or 20 mg) and lorazepam (2 mg) on various psychometric tests. Zolmitriptan doses less than 20 mg had no statistically significant effects on choice reaction time, the Stroop test, visual analog scale (VAS) assessments of physical sedation, tranquilization and other types of feelings, the logical reasoning test or the adaptive tracking test. There was a mild transient increase in the subjective assessment on VAS of mental sedation which was dose related and occurred mainly with the highest zolmitriptan dose and were not reflected in objective measures of drug effects. In contrast, lorazepam (used as a positive control) was associated with statistically significant impairment in all tests (except tranquilization) for up to 10 h after dosing. The results demonstrate that therapeutic doses of zolmitriptan are unlikely to cause clinically significant impairment in psychometric performance.",4,E

Within 2 hours, headache severity decreased to none/mild in 86% of all attacks in the sumatriptan group (STG) compared to 25% in the customary group (CTG). Migraine was alleviated earlier in the STG than in the CTG (median 3.78 vs. 13.39 hours, p < 0.0001). The direct and total cost of treatment was 133 and 2012 BF, respectively, in the CTG and 1400 and 2522 BF, respectively, in the STG. Measuring the effectiveness of earlier pain relief with sumatriptan, the incremental cost-effective ratios for direct and total cost were 132 and 53 BF per hour of relieved pain, respectively. For this price, significantly more sumatriptan patients improved their quality of life by more than 20% (61.6 vs. 20.6% patients, p < 0.001) and less sumatriptan patient consulted a medical professional (11.3 vs. 29.2% patients, p < 0.01), used less medication for adverse events (6.2 vs. 22.5%, p < 0.001) and suffered less from associated migraine symptoms. The median number of hours of diminished work-efficiency (3 vs. 7 hours, p < 0.01) or of suspension of non-professional activity (10 vs. 24 hours, p < 0.001) was also significantly lower in the STG. The total cost per successfully treated patient was lower in the STG. Sumatriptan is more effective, provides a better quality of life, reduces health care resource utilisation, and improves work productivity as compared to the CTG, thereby resulting in a favourable cost-effectiveness ratio.",I,E

The following search terms were used: chronic daily headache, transformed migraine, analgesic withdrawal headache, analgesic rebound headache, drug-associated headache, medication-induced headache, detoxification, and dihydroergotamine. In addition, a review of the references from relevant literature was also conducted to collect reports not identified in the MEDLINE search.; Numerous therapies for acute management of MIH have been evaluated, although no rigorously conducted clinical trials were identified. Therapies evaluated include abrupt withdrawal of analgesics, initiation of dihydroergotamine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, methylergonovine, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan, amitriptyline, dexamethasone, piracetam, prothipendyl, and valproate. Epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical features, pathophysiology, and long-term prognosis of therapy are discussed and therapeutic guidelines are offered.; MIH is an underrecognized and difficult condition affecting headache-prone patients. The published literature concerning treatment of patients with MIH is scant and of poor quality, making it difficult for clinicians to decide on appropriate therapy. Recognition and treatment of MIH may lead to a long-term improvement in headache relief for many patients. It appears that complete withdrawal of the medications being overused is required for favorable long-term results.",4,E

Many novel antimigraine compounds are in clinical development, yet full characterization of each one's pharmacodynamic behavior is a formidable task due to the difficulty in studying a migraineur during an attack. Nitroglycerin (NTG) administration commonly causes a headache with some features similar to those of a migraine. As such, NTG has been used as a model of vascular headaches, including migraine. The pharmacodynamic effects of nitroglycerin and sumatriptan on middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv) and headache scores were studied in 10 healthy male volunteers. An intravenous infusion of NTG titrated to 0.5 mcg/kg/min over 30 minutes resulted in a median reduction from baseline in MCAv of 27% (range: 16.4%-37.3%). Nine of the subjects developed a headache with a median verbal score of 3.5 of 10 (range: 0-5). Subjects received sumatriptan either 2 mg intravenously or 6 mg subcutaneously, which abated clinical headache in 9 of the 10 subjects (p = 0.030). A median sumatriptan-induced increase in MCAv of 21% (p = 0.054) suggested a constricting effect on the NTG-induced dilated MCA. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic/indirect-effects pharmacodynamic model was fit to the sumatriptan concentration and MCAv data using iterative two-stage analysis. This model was unbiased and fit the concentration (r2 = 0.98) and the MCAv (r2 = 0.79) data well. These results suggest that NTG-induced headache and the development of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models could serve as a useful method for exploring the mechanisms of abortive migraine drugs.",4,E
