Patients were taught to adjust the bedtime insulin dose on the basis of fasting glucose measurements.; Body weight, biochemical and symptomatic hypoglycemias, and indices of glycemic control.; At 1 year, body weight remained unchanged in patients receiving bedtime insulin plus metformin (mean change, 0.9 +/- 1.2 kg; P < 0.001 compared with all other groups) but increased by 3.9 +/- 0.7 kg, 3.6 +/- 1.2 kg, and 4.6 +/- 1.0 kg in patients receiving bedtime insulin plus glyburide, those receiving bedtime insulin plus both oral drugs, and those receiving bedtime and morning insulin, respectively. The greatest decrease in the glycosylated hemoglobin value was observed in the bedtime insulin and metformin group (from 9.7% +/- 0.4% to 7.2% +/- 0.2% [difference, -2.5 +/- 0.4 percentage points] at 1 year; P < 0.001 compared with 0 months and P < 0.05 compared with other groups). This group also had significantly fewer symptomatic and biochemical cases of hypoglycemia (P < 0.05) than the other groups.; Combination therapy with bedtime insulin plus metformin prevents weight gain. This regimen also seems superior to other bedtime insulin regimens with respect to improvement in glycemic control and frequency of hypoglycemia.",E,E

As ATP-sensitive K+ channels appear to be a mediator of ischaemic preconditioning in both experimental and clinical studies, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of K(ATP) channels in the warm-up phenomenon.; Twenty-six patients with coronary artery disease were randomized to receive 10 mg oral glibenclamide, a selective ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker, or placebo. Sixty minutes after glibenclamide or placebo administration, patients were given an infusion of 10% dextrose (8 ml x min(-1)) to correct glucose plasma levels or, respectively, an infusion of saline at the same infusion rate. Thirty minutes after the beginning of the infusions, both patient groups underwent two consecutive treadmill exercise tests, with a recovery period of 15 min to re-establish baseline conditions. Before exercise tests, blood glucose levels were similar in placebo and glibenclamide groups (96 +/- 10 vs 105 +/- 22 mg x 100 ml(-1), P=ns). After placebo administration, rate-pressure product at 1.5 mm ST-segment depression significantly increased during the second exercise test compared to the first (220 +/- 41 vs 186 +/- 29 beats x min(-1) x mmHg x 10(2), P<0.01), but it did not change after glibenclamide (191 +/- 34 vs 187 +/- 42 beats x min(-1) x mmHg x 10(2), P=ns), with a significant drug-test interaction (P=0.0091, at two-way ANOVA).; Glibenclamide, at a dose previously shown to abolish ischaemic preconditioning during coronary angioplasty, prevents the increase of ischaemic threshold observed during the second of two sequential exercise tests. These findings confirm that ischaemic preconditioning plays a key role in the warm-up phenomenon and that in this setting is, at least partially, mediated by activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels.",I,I
10085698,[Short-term intensive insulin therapy as a method of overcoming secondary failure of sulfonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes (non-insulin-dependent)].,"Aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Resistance; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Glyburide; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Male; Middle Aged; Phenformin; Sulfonylurea Compounds; Treatment Failure","Jedynasty, K; Kasperska-Czyzykowa, T; Stepie艅, K; Nowaczyk, R","The study group comprised 56 patients (25 males and 31 females) with type 2 diabetes in whom the secondary failure to sulphonylurea derivates (SU) had developed. All patients were submitted for 14 days to therapy with 5 injections of insulin per day in total dose of insulin permitting to decrease the mean daily glycaemia below 8.8 mmol/l (160 mg/dl). After the termination of the intensive insulin therapy (IIT) the patients with insulin requirement below 44 U daily were alternatively qualified to treatment with SU (glybenclamide) alone or with this SU plus biguanide derivate (BG: phenformin), and those who needed more than 44 U daily continued conventional therapy with insulin alone or with insulin plus SU (glybenclamide). There was a marked reduction of fasting and postprandial blood glucose during the IIT and over the subsequent 15 months of the follow-up. The mean glycaemia which initially was in fasting state 12.5 +/- 2.4 mmol/l (225 +/- 43 mg/dl) and 2 hours after breakfast 18.1 +/- 2.8 mmol/l (325 +/- 50 mg/dl) decreased significantly and was in four groups between 8.0 +/- 0.3 mmol/l (144 +/- 5 mg/dl) and 10.8 +/- 0.5 mmol/l (194 +/- 9 mg/dl) in fasting state and between 10.5 +/- 0.3 (189 +/- 5 mg/dl) and 11.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (201 +/- 7 mg/dl) after breakfast. The least hypoglycaemic effect was found in patients who after IIT were treated exclusively with insulin (mean daily dose 53 +/- 2 IU) while the decrease of glycaemia was most evident in patients treated with SU given as a single drug or in combination with BG or with insulin (mean daily dose 19 +/- 1 IU). In all studied patients basal and stimulated (1 mg glucagon i.v.) C-peptide secretion markedly decreased during IIT, and greatly increased after its termination, and this increase persisted over following 15 months of observation, correlating with the initial values.; The short-term IIT in patients with NIDDM and secondary failure to SU is effective in reducing hyperglycaemia, and in most of them makes possible to continue the oral antidiabetic treatment with SU. The secretion of endogenous insulin seems to have only limited influence on the metabolic control of the patients treated with four different pharmacological regiments after IIT.",E,E
10097930,A 1-year multicenter randomized double-blind comparison of repaglinide and glyburide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Dutch and German Repaglinide Study Group.,"Adult; Blood Glucose; Carbamates; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Double-Blind Method; Fasting; Female; Glyburide; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Male; Middle Aged; Piperidines","Wolffenbuttel, B H; Landgraf, R","Repaglinide is a newly developed oral blood glucose-lowering agent that exerts its effect by stimulating insulin secretion. This multicenter study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of this drug with glyburide in a 1-year randomized double-blind study of outpatients with type 2 diabetes.; A total of 424 subjects (154 women, 270 men) participated and had the following characteristics: age, 61 +/- 9 years; duration of diabetes. 8 years (range 0.5-35); BMI, 28.3 +/- 3.5 kg/m2; HbA1c, 7.1 +/- 1.4%; and fasting plasma glucose, 10.8 +/- 3.1 mmol/l. The majority of the subjects (91%) were previously treated with sulfonylurea, alone or in combination with metformin. The patients were randomized to a 2:1 ratio of repaglinide (0.5-4 mg t.i.d.) or glyburide (1.75-10.5 mg daily) treatment. The study protocol included a screening visit to assess patient eligibility; a titration period of 6-8 weeks, during which the dosages of repaglinide and glyburide were optimized; and a subsequent 12-month treatment period on fixed, optimal dosages.; The trial was completed by 320 subjects, 211 (74%) in the repaglinide and 109 (78%) in the glyburide group. HbA1c initially decreased in both groups and then increased during the second half-year of the maintenance period to a similar extent in the repaglinide and glyburide subjects (0.58 and 0.45% vs. at screening, respectively). In the small group of subjects who previously controlled their condition with diet only (n = 37), a sustained improvement of metabolic control could be observed with both drugs, which was slightly better with glyburide than with repaglinide (theta HbA1c -2.4 vs. -1.0%; P < 0.05). The same trends were seen with fasting plasma glucose. There were no changes in serum lipids. Over the course of the study, 15% of the repaglinide-treated and 13% of glyburide-treated subjects withdrew due to adverse events, mostly hyperglycemia. No differences in adverse events between both drugs were reported. There were no differences in incidences of hypoglycemia.; Repaglinide is a safe and efficacious oral blood glucose-lowering agent, with a potency similar to that of glyburide. Its rapid onset of action and hepatic clearance allows meal-related administration, including in subjects with impaired kidney function.",I,I
10178657,A short term cost-effectiveness model for oral antidiabetic medicines in Europe.,"Cost-Benefit Analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Europe; Glyburide; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Metformin; Models, Economic","Hood, S C; Annemans, L; Rutten-van M枚lken, M","A short term (6-month) cost-effectiveness model has been developed to simulate current medical practice and disease progression in patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus uncontrolled by diet and exercise. The model is based on decision-analytical techniques and includes probabilities of switching between treatments, the reason for the switch and the most common switch options. Effectiveness and economic measures are the 2 main outcomes. In order to assess effectiveness, we use symptom-free days with acceptable control (SFDACs), which represent each day of treatment without adverse events or symptoms, and with acceptable control of glucose and lipids. For the economic evaluation, only incremental costs incurred directly by a health insurance system are considered. This model should prove useful in the evaluation of new oral antidiabetic agents, since the short term aim of antidiabetic therapy is to provide adequate control in the absence of adverse effects and symptoms (a prerequisite for successful long term treatment). Furthermore, short term analysis provides data for comparing initial investment in drug therapy with potential savings over a longer treatment period.",E,E
10178668,Evaluation of the potential clinical and economic effects of bodyweight stabilisation with acarbose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A decision-analytical approach.,"Acarbose; Adult; Body Weight; Decision Support Techniques; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Trisaccharides","Banz, K; Dinkel, R; Hanefeld, M; Schwanebeck, U","Bodyweight is an acknowledged independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). The present model analysis was undertaken to investigate the clinical and economic impact of bodyweight gain in patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and its effects on the development of CHD. Based on a retrospective re-evaluation of data from the Diabetes Intervention Study (DIS), patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stable bodyweight (group A) had a significantly lower rate of combined CHD events (30.3%) than patients showing a bodyweight gain (group B; 38.2%) over 10 years. Prevention of bodyweight gain, therefore, appears to be a meaningful strategy in the management of diabetes mellitus. In addition to this clinical advantage, prevention of CHD will also result in economic savings associated with avoided treatment of coronary events. Based on the clinical outcomes from the DIS, the calculated per-patient net savings for a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stable bodyweight amounted to 1085 deutschmarks (DM) when compared with a patient experiencing a bodyweight increase. In a further step, the above situation was projected to current type 2 diabetes mellitus practice. Oral first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is usually initiated with glibenclamide (glyburide), which is known to increase bodyweight (reflecting group B). The novel alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose, in contrast, appears to be as effective as glibenclamide, but has the advantage of being bodyweight-neutral (reflecting group A). From the clinical viewpoint, acarbose can thus be considered an alternative to glibenclamide. From the viewpoint of drug costs, monotherapy with acarbose is 4 times as expensive as glibenclamide in Germany, resulting in per-patient incremental costs of DM3527 for acarbose over 10 years. Balanced against the potential 10-year cost saving of DM1085 resulting from the potential of acarbose to prevent CHD, around one-third of the incremental cost of acarbose may be recouped by this single effect. However, further possible benefits of acarbose, including the avoidance of hypoglycaemia and the deferral of costly insulin therapy, may improve the economic value of this novel antidiabetic agent. Given the indirect approach of this evaluation and its many limitations, the above findings need critical appraisal, and comparative trials are urgently required to substantiate our preliminary results.",E,E
10193691,Troglitazone: a review of its use in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Adult; Aged; Animals; Area Under Curve; Chromans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Interactions; Glucose; Glyburide; Half-Life; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Thiazoles; Thiazolidinediones","Plosker, G L; Faulds, D","Troglitazone is the first of a new group of oral antidiabetic drugs, the thiazolidinediones, and is indicated for the treatment of patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Troglitazone acts by enhancing the effects of insulin at peripheral target sites and, unlike the sulphonylurea drugs, is not associated with hypoglycaemia when administered as monotherapy. Clinical trials with troglitazone (usually 200 to 600 mg/day) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus consistently showed marked improvement in glycaemic control, as well as reductions in fasting serum insulin, C-peptide and triglyceride levels. Comparative studies with either glibenclamide (glyburide) or metformin indicated similar glycaemic control with troglitazone or these agents. Serum insulin levels were lower with troglitazone than with glibenclamide. Clinical trials of up to approximately 2 years' duration showed that glycaemic control is maintained with troglitazone on a long term basis. In general, troglitazone is well tolerated by the majority of patients. However, discontinuation of troglitazone because of elevated liver enzyme levels occurs in approximately 2% of patients receiving the drug, and frequent monitoring of liver enzymes is required (e.g. at least 11 times during the first year of therapy). Among patients who started troglitazone therapy in 1998 (after the incorporation of a boxed warning and increased monitoring requirements in the product labelling), the estimated risk of liver-related death is approximately 1 in 100,000.; Troglitazone improves the ability of target cells to respond to insulin. The drug has been shown to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when used as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin, and its efficacy is similar to that of glibenclamide or metformin. Although troglitazone is generally well tolerated, close monitoring of liver enzyme function is required to minimise the rare occurrence of serious hepatic dysfunction. Drug acquisition and liver function monitoring costs, as well as potential adverse effects, are important factors that may ultimately determine the precise place of troglitazone in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nevertheless, as the first member of a new class of oral antidiabetic agents, the thiazolidinediones, troglitazone offers an effective treatment option in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus through its action of improving insulin sensitivity.",E,E

We cross-tabulated FPG concentrations (<6.1 mmol/L [110 mg/dL], 6.1-6.9 mmol/L [110-125 mg/dL], 7.0-7.7 mmol/L [126-139 mg/dL], and > or =7.8 mmol/L [140 mg/dL]) and HbA1c levels separated into 3 intervals: normal, less than the upper limit of normal (ULN); slightly elevated, ULN to ULN plus 1%; and high, higher than ULN plus 1%.; Among subjects with normal FPG concentrations, HbA1c levels in the NHANES III (and the MRG) data sets were normal in 97.3% (96.2%), slightly elevated in 2.7% (3.6%), and high in 0.1% (0.2%). Among individuals with impaired fasting glucose, HbA1c concentrations were normal in 86.7% (81.4%), slightly elevated in 13.1% (16.4%), and high in 0.2% (2.2%). Among diabetic patients diagnosed by the new FPG criterion only, HbA1c levels were normal in 60.9% (59.6%), slightly elevated in 35.8% (32.8%), and high in 3.4% (7.6%). In diabetic patients diagnosed by the former FPG criterion, HbA1c levels were normal in 18.6% (16.7%), slightly elevated in 32.5% (21.0%), and high in 48.9% (62.3%).; About 60% of the new cohort of diabetic patients in both data sets have normal HbA1c levels. We believe that diabetes should not be diagnosed in those with FPG concentrations less than 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) unless excessive glycosylation is evident. Individuals without excessive glycosylation but with moderate elevations of FPG concentrations (6.1-7.7 mmol/L [110-139 mg/dL]) should be diagnosed as having impaired fasting glucose and treated with an appropriate diet and exercise. This diagnostic labeling achieves the goal of early intervention without subjecting these persons to the potentially negative insurance, employment, social, and psychological consequences of a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.",I,I

This study was performed to evaluate whether this results in a better maintenance of ATP-dependent K+ channel mediated ischaemic myocardial preconditioning.; In a double-blind placebo-controlled study the period of total coronary occlusion during balloon angioplasty of high grade coronary artery stenoses was used as a model to compare the effects of both drugs. Quantification of myocardial ischaemia was achieved by recording the intracoronary ECG and the time to the occurrence of angina during vessel occlusion. All patients underwent three dilatations. The first dilatation (dilatation 1) served to determine the severity of ischaemia during vessel occlusion. During dilatation 2, baseline values were recorded. Thereafter, glimepiride (15 patients: 1.162 mg), glibenclamide (15 patients: 2.54 mg) or placebo (15 patients) were intravenously administered over 12 min. Dilatation 3 started 10 min after the beginning of the drug administration. Mean ST segment shifts in the placebo group decreased by 35% (dilatation 2: 0.23; dilatation 3:0.15 mV; CI -0.55 to 0.00 mV; P=0.049). A similar reduction also occurred in the glimepiride group, in which repetitive balloon occlusion led to a 34% reduction (dilatation 2: 0.35; dilatation 3: 0.23 mV; CI -0.21 to -0.02 mV; P=0.01). There was little influence however, on mean ST segment shifts in the glibenclamide group (dilatation 2 and dilatation 3: 0.24 mV; CI -0.10 to 0.25 mV; P=0.34). Accordingly, time to angina during balloon occlusion slightly increased (by 30%) in the placebo group (dilatation 2: 37 s; dilatation 3: 48 s; CI 0.0 to 15.0 s; P=0.16); increased by 13% in the glimepiride group (dilatation 2: 40 s; dilatation 3: 45 s; CI 0.0 to 14.0 s; P=0023); and remained unchanged in the glibenclamide group (dilatation 2 and dilatation 3: 30 s; CI -7.5 to 7.5 s; P=0.67).; These results show that glimepiride maintains myocardial preconditioning, while glibenclamide might be able to prevent it.",E,E

South Asian subjects with Type 2 DM are thought to be more insulin resistant and the effect of sulphonylureas may be different. We therefore investigated the effect of sulphonylurea therapy with gliclazide on beta-cell function in South Asian subjects with newly diagnosed Type 2 DM.; Glucose, insulin, and intact and 32/33 split proinsulin were measured at diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). After 8-12 weeks on a conventional diet, subjects with a fasting glucose > 6 mmol/l (n = 16) were commenced on gliclazide.; At diagnosis, those requiring gliclazide were more hyperglycaemic but there was no difference in weight or fasting insulin concentration than in the diet group. Following diet, in the gliclazide group, weight fell (P < 0.04) with no change in fasting glucose concentration. Fasting intact proinsulin, insulin and 32/33 split proinsulin remained unchanged. After gliclazide therapy weight remained unchanged, but fasting glucose fell (P < 0.003). Fasting insulin and intact proinsulin remained unchanged but 32/33 split proinsulin fell (P < 0.05). Fasting insulin to glucose ratio significantly improved after gliclazide (P < 0.006).; In South Asian subjects treated with gliclazide the reduction in fasting glucose concentrations appears to be due to an improvement in insulin sensitivity as well as in beta-cell function.",E,E

The study consisted of an initial screening day, a titration period of 3 weeks, a 1-week stabilization period, a study period, and an end-of-study day. During the 3-day study period, half the patients of each group received two meals on the first day and three meals on the next 2 days, and in the other half, this sequence was reversed. Repaglinide was administered preprandially with each meal, and glyburide was administered as recommended in current labeling, i.e., either one or two daily doses before breakfast and dinner, regardless of whether lunch had been omitted. The diurnal blood glucose excursions on a day in which three meals were eaten were compared between the two groups, and the minimum blood glucose concentration (BGmin) measurements were compared between lunch and dinner on days with three and two meals.; Of the 83 randomized patients, 43 entered into the 3-day study period and completed the trial. The results showed no significant differences between the repaglinide and glyburide groups in average blood glucose excursions from fasting blood glucose (P = 0.44). The influence on the mean BGmin of omitting a meal differed significantly between the repaglinide and glyburide groups (P = 0.014). In the latter group, BGmin decreased from 77 to 61 mg/dl as a result of omitting lunch, whereas in the repaglinide group, BGmin was unchanged for the two-meal day (78 mg/dl) and the three-meal day (76 mg/dl). All hypoglycemic events (n = 6) occurred in the glyburide group on the two-meal day, in connection with omitting lunch. No hypoglycemic events were recorded in the repaglinide group.; These results suggest that treatment with repaglinide in well-controlled type 2 diabetic patients who miss or delay a meal is superior to treatment with longer-acting sulfonylurea drugs (such as glyburide) with respect to the risk of hypoglycemic episodes.",I,I

Data had to be reported in at least three quantiles or intervals so that the nature of the relationship between glucose and cardiovascular events (i.e., linear or nonlinear) could be explored, and to ensure that any incremental cardiovascular risk was consistent across quantiles or intervals.; Analyzed studies comprised 95,783 people (94% male) who had 3,707 cardiovascular events over 12.4 years (1,193,231 person-years). Studies reporting fasting glucose levels (n = 6), 2-h glucose levels (n = 7), 1-h glucose levels (n = 5), and casual glucose levels (n = 4) were included. The glucose load used varied from 50 to 100 g. The highest glucose interval for most studies included glucose values in the diabetic range. The relationship between glucose levels and the risk of a cardiovascular event was modeled for each study and the beta-coefficients were combined. Compared with a glucose level of 4.2 mmol/l (75 mg/dl), a fasting and 2-h glucose level of 6.1 mmol/dl (110 mg/dl) and 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) was associated with a relative cardiovascular event risk of 1.33 (95% CI 1.06-1.67) and 1.58 (95% CI 1.19-2.10), respectively.; The progressive relationship between glucose levels and cardiovascular risk extends below the diabetic threshold.",E,E

In 10 healthy individuals the fasting plasma amylin level was 1.56 +/- 0.27 pmol/l (mean +/- SEM) and 6 min after i.v. injection of 1 mg glucagon a fourfold increase was observed. In 10 patients with NIDDM receiving glibenclamide (CAS 10238-21-8) the fasting plasma amylin level was twofold higher than in healthy control (2.72 +/- 0.38 pmol/l; p < 0.025) but following glucagon administration it increased only twofold. In 15 patients treated with metformin (CAS 657-24-9) the fasting plasma amylin level was similar to that in healthy individuals (1.64 +/- 0.25 pmol/l), but after glucagon stimulation the increment of plasma amylin was minimal and the relevant mean value was significantly lower when compared with those in healthy individuals and with NIDDM patients treated with glibenclamide. In 10 untreated obese patients with newly diagnosed NIDDM the administration of glibenclamide (14 days) resulted in the increase of basal (2.47 +/- 0.23 and 3.16 +/- 0.29 pmol/l; p < 0.1), and glucagon stimulated (3.34 +/- 0.39 and 4.56 +/- 0.38; p < 0.05) plasma amylin concentrations, whereas other 10 patients receiving metformin showed a decrease in fasting plasma level of this peptide before (2.64 +/- 0.59 and 1.28 +/- 0.38 pmol/l; p < 0.1), and after glucagon injection (5.02 +/- 0.55 and 2.83 +/- 0.65 pmol/l; p < 0.02). With the respect to the trophic effect of amyloid deposits in the pancreatic islets and to a hypothetic effect of amylin increasing insulin resistance, the present results emphasize the particular usefulness of metformin in the pharmacological treatment of NIDDM. All contraindications and side effects of metformin should be taken into account before drug administration.",E,E

To expand on this finding, we investigated at the clinical level how long-term administration of troglitazone influences the body fat distribution in type 2 diabetic patients.; Troglitazone (400 mg/day) was administered for 6 months to 30 type 2 diabetic patients whose glycemic control was poor. A total of 18 patients received diet therapy alone (in the single-treatment group, BMI 26.0 +/- 4.6, HbA1c 8.2 +/- 1.7%), and 12 patients concomitantly received glibenclamide (1.25-7.5 mg/day) (in the concomitant sulfonylurea group, BMI 25.4 +/- 4.7, HbA1c 9.2 +/- 1.2%). BMI, HbA1c, serum lipid level, and body fat distribution, which were determined by computed tomography (CT) scan at the umbilical level, were measured and compared before and after troglitazone treatment.; During the 6-month troglitazone treatment, HbA1c levels decreased and BMI increased in both groups. As for body fat distribution in the single-treatment group, visceral fat area (VFA) decreased (from 118.3 +/- 54.3 to 101.1 +/- 50.8 cm2; P < 0.001), and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) increased (from 189.7 +/- 93.3 to 221.6 +/- 101.6 cm2; P < 0.001), resulting in a decrease in visceral/subcutaneous (V/S) ratio (from 0.74 +/- 0.48 to 0.50 +/- 0.32; P < 0.001). In the concomitant sulfonylurea group, VFA was unchanged (from 108.1 +/- 53.5 to 112.5 +/- 59.9 cm2), while SFA increased (from 144.6 +/- 122.0 to 180.5 +/- 143.5 cm2; P < 0.01), thereby decreasing the V/S ratio (from 0.91 +/- 0.46 to 0.77 +/- 0.44; P < 0.01). The serum triglyceride level and the area under glucose curve during the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test decreased significantly in the single-treatment group.; According to our data, troglitazone appears to promote fat accumulation in the subcutaneous adipose tissue rather than in the visceral adipose tissue in mildly obese Japanese people with type 2 diabetes.

In animal models of insulin resistance, rosiglitazone decreased plasma glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels and also attenuated or prevented diabetic nephropathy and pancreatic islet cell degeneration. In contrast with troglitazone, rosiglitazone does not induce cytochrome P4503A4 metabolism. It does not interact significantly with nifedipine, oral contraceptives, metformin, digoxin, ranitidine or acarbose. In clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, rosiglitazone 2 to 12 mg/day (as a single daily dose or 2 divided daily doses) improved glycaemic control, as shown by decreases in fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Addition of rosiglitazone 2 to 8 mg/day to existing sulphonylurea, metformin or insulin therapy achieved further reductions in fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c. Oral combinations improved insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function according to a homeostasis model assessment. Consistent with its mechanism of action, rosiglitazone appears to be associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia (<2% of patients receiving monotherapy).

Twenty-two patients with DM with normal to high-normal BP and 12 controls matched for age, gender, glucose tolerance, and BP were studied. DM subjects showed significantly higher systolic BP response during MAT than controls (157 versus 139 mm Hg; P<0.01). All 22 DM patients and 5 of 12 controls had systolic BP >140 mm Hg during MAT. Heart rate and diastolic BP were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The DM group was then randomized to receive troglitazone (n=10; 400 mg/d) or glyburide (n=12; 20 mg/d). MAT was repeated after 6 months of treatment. Both treatments reduced glucose equally (-1.7 mmol/L for troglitazone and -1.5 mmol/L for glyburide), but only troglitazone reduced insulin (-15 microU/mL; P<0.001) and C-peptide (-0.9 ng/mL; P<0.02) levels. Troglitazone significantly reduced BP at baseline (P<0.05) and systolic BP response to MAT (P<0.01), whereas glyburide did not affect BP at baseline or during MAT. Stroke volume and cardiac output did not change with either drug, but troglitazone decreased peripheral vascular resistance (-112 dyne. s. cm(-5); P<0.05). Improved insulin resistance rather than an improved glycemic control is associated with lower resting and stress BP values in patients with DM. A reduction in vascular resistance may be a primary hemodynamic mechanism of the manner in which troglitazone lowers BP. Insulin sensitizers may offer potential therapeutic advantage in subjects with DM with elevated BP.",E,E
10416947,"High-dose biotin, an inducer of glucokinase expression, may synergize with chromium picolinate to enable a definitive nutritional therapy for type II diabetes.","Biotin; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Synergism; Enzyme Induction; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Glucokinase; Iron Chelating Agents; Picolinic Acids","McCarty, M F","Glucokinase (GK), expressed in hepatocyte and pancreatic beta cells, has a central regulatory role in glucose metabolism. Efficient GK activity is required for normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, postprandial hepatic glucose uptake, and the appropriate suppression of hepatic glucose output and gluconeogenesis by elevated plasma glucose. Hepatic GK activity is subnormal in diabetes, and GK may also be decreased in the beta cells of type II diabetics. In supraphysiological concentrations, biotin promotes the transcription and translation of the GK gene in hepatocytes; this effect appears to be mediated by activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. More recent evidence indicates that biotin likewise increases GK activity in islet cells. On the other hand, high-dose biotin suppresses hepatocyte transcription of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme for gluconeogenesis. Administration of high-dose biotin has improved glycemic control in several diabetic animals models, and a recent Japanese clinical study concludes that biotin (3 mg t.i.d. orally) can substantially lower fasting glucose in type II diabetics, without side-effects. The recently demonstrated utility of chromium picolinate in type II diabetes appears to reflect improved peripheral insulin sensitivity--a parameter which is unlikely to be directly influenced by biotin. Thus, the joint administration of supranutritional doses of biotin and chromium picolinate is likely to combat insulin resistance, improve beta-cell function, enhance postprandial glucose uptake by both liver and skeletal muscle, and inhibit excessive hepatic glucose production. Conceivably, this safe, convenient, nutritional regimen will constitute a definitive therapy for many type II diabetics, and may likewise be useful in the prevention and management of gestational diabetes. Biotin should also aid glycemic control in type I patients.",E,E

Sixteen patients (group 1) were identified who demonstrated progressive improvement in LVFS, ultimately recovering to within the normal range. They were compared with 47 patients (group 2) in whom LVFS remained depressed. Group 1 LVFS at first examination was 13.6% +/- 5.1%, z = -10.8 +/- 4.0, and improved to within the normal range (33.7% +/- 3.4%, z = -0.9 +/- 1. 4, P <.001).

The relationship between the total plasma and analgesic effect has been established. Only small amounts of bromfenac are eliminated unchanged, with the remaining drug being biotransformed into glucuronide metabolites which are excreted in urine and bile. Rapid elimination occurs in healthy individuals (half-life 0.5 to 4.0 h). Renal disease, hepatic disease and aging alter the disposition kinetics of bromfenac, and dosage adjustment may be advisable.

10430816,Type 2 diabetes: an overview.,"Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Resistance; Obesity; Risk Factors","Lebovitz, H E","Type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder. Clinical expression of the disorder requires both genetic and environmental factors. One theory concerning its etiology is that it is the result of the evolution of a thrifty genotype that had survival benefits in the past but is detrimental in the current environment. An opposing theory is that it represents an adult metabolic response to fetal malnutrition. Hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes results from absolute or relative insulin deficiency. Most often relative insulin deficiency is attributable to an inability to adequately compensate for insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may be caused by a variety of genetic or metabolic factors. The most common etiological factor in insulin resistance is central obesity. Insulin resistance is associated with a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that include glucose intolerance, hypertension, a unique dyslipidemia, a procoagulant state, and an increase in macrovascular disease. Clinical intervention studies have demonstrated that reduction in the chronic microvascular and macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes requires treatment of hyperglycemia to achieve hemoglobin A1c <7.0%, blood pressure </=130/80 mmHg, and plasma LDL-cholesterol </=2.6 mmol/L (</=100 mg/dL). Oral antihyperglycemic agents increase endogenous insulin secretion, decrease insulin resistance, or lower postprandial plasma glucose rise by delaying absorption of complex carbohydrates. Long-term glycemic control in type 2 diabetes requires progressive, stepwise, combination treatment with oral agents and eventually combination treatment with oral agents and insulin.",E,E

After a 30-day run-in period of dietary treatment, patients received combined glyburide (5, 7.5 or 10 mg/day) and metformin (800, 1,200 or 1,600 mg/day) as preconstitued, fixed combinations, or glyburide alone (5, 10 or 15 mg/day). The dose was increased stepwise so as to have 1 (T1), 2 (T2) and 3 (T3) months of treatment for any given regimen (6 months in total). After 2 weeks of washout (T4), the groups were then crossed over (T5, T6, T7 periods). Body weight, fasting plasma glucose, HbA(1c), blood lactate, total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured at the beginning and end of T1 and T5, and end of T2, T3, T6 and T7; postprandial plasma glucose, fasting and postprandial plasma insulin and C-peptide were evaluated at the beginning of T1 and T5, and end of T3 and T7. At these latter time points additional assessments included routine clinical chemistry measurements, ECG, and ophthalmoscopic examination. Statistical analysis was performed by the paired Student's t-test and analysis of variance for cross-over studies. Thirty-three patients completed the study. Fasting plasma glucose, postprandial plasma glucose and HbA(1c) levels improved significantly during combined treatment with glyburide at lower doses plus metformin. This effect was achieved without any major change of insulin and C-peptide concentrations. Circulating lactate concentrations increased during the regimen including metformin, but they remained well within the reference values for normal subjects. Plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides levels remained substantielly unchanged throughout the study, whereas HDL-cholesterol concentrations increased slightly, but significantly, with glyburide plus metformin therapy. Routine clinical chemistry measurements, ECG and ophthalmoscopic examinations did not change during the study. These results demonstrate that improved metabolic control can be achieved with preconstituted, fixed combinations of low-dose glyburide plus metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes, compared to higher doses of the sulphonylurea alone.",I,I

Forty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were on conventional insulin therapy (subcutaneous insulin therapy consisting of regular and NPH insulin, two times a day) were included in the study. They were randomized to double blind treatment with insulin in combination with gliclazide or acarbose for 6 months. For both groups, acceptable glycemic control was achieved at the end of study period. The mean HbA(1c) levels decreased from 8.32+/-0.26 to 7.13+/-0.18% in acarbose group and 8. 6+/-0.15 to 7.48+/-0.21% in the gliclazide group. The difference between groups was not significant (P 0.29). In the acarbose group, total cholesterol and LDL concentration decreased significantly while other parameters did not change. In the gliclazide group, HDL levels decreased significantly from 46.6+/-2.48 mg/dl to 41.3+/-2.09 mg/dl (P 0.001) BMI increased significantly from 27.60+/-1.21 kg/m(2) to 28.69+/-1.26 kg/m(2). (P 0.003) Total daily insulin dose was not changed in the acarbose group significantly, but increased from 42.6+/-2.73 to 49.27+/-3.58 U/day, which was significant in gliclazide group of (P 0.016). In the acarbose group, there were no significant differences between responders and nonresponders with respect to fasting and stimulated C-peptide, HbA(1c) levels and baseline BMI values. But in the gliclazide group, baseline BMI values were significantly higher in the nonresponding group compared to responders (P 0.02). In conclusion, combination of insulin with acarbose can be a good alternative for type 2 diabetic patients on insulin therapy; seems more beneficial than combination with gliclazide; may have advantage of achieving good glycemic control without increasing insulin dose and BMI; also may have the advantage of providing a decrease in LDL level, which are all important to prevent atherosclerosis.",E,E

An elevated rate of basal hepatic glucose production in the presence of hyperinsulinemia is the primary cause of fasting hyperglycemia; after a meal, impaired suppression of hepatic glucose production by insulin and decreased insulin-mediated glucose uptake by muscle contribute almost equally to postprandial hyperglycemia. In the United States, five classes of oral agents, each of which works through a different mechanism of action, are currently available to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The recently completed United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) has shown that type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive disorder that can be treated initially with oral agent monotherapy but will eventually require the addition of other oral agents, and that in many patients, insulin therapy will be needed to achieve targeted glycemic levels. In the UKPDS, improved glycemic control, irrespective of the agent used (sulfonylureas, metformin, or insulin), decreased the incidence of microvascular complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy). This review examines the goals of antihyperglycemic therapy and reviews the mechanism of action, efficacy, nonglycemic benefits, cost, and safety profile of each of the five approved classes of oral agents. A rationale for the use of these oral agents as monotherapy, in combination with each other, and in combination with insulin is provided.",I,I

The half-life of sertraline is about 26 h so that it reaches a steady state in one week, according to the product monograph. Hypoglycemia associated with sertraline and coadministration of oral hypoglycemics belonging to the sulphonylurea derivatives has rarely been reported. A patient with schizoaffective disorder with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) treated with sertraline, risperidone and glyburide who developed hypoglycemia is presented. The article highlights that inhibition of P450 enzymes can be affected by several different factors. Interactions are possible whenever a patient concomitantly receives two drugs that bind to the same P450 system Greater inhibition was likely induced at doses higher than those recommended. This process was reversed within 10 days of discontinuing the sertraline. Good glycemic control followed discontinuation of psychotropic drugs and the oral hypoglycemic agent. Knowledge of the individual P450 enzymes is important in the metabolism of individual drugs, together with an understanding of the patient's drug metabolizing ability. These factors may lead to more appropriate prescribing and further research into specific P450 enzymes responsible for metabolism of particular drugs, which remains unclear.",E,E

Mean follow-up was 7.3 years. We assessed the risk of death according to the different diagnostic glucose categories.; Compared with men who had normal fasting glucose (< 6.1 mmol/L), men with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus by the ADA fasting criteria (> or = 7.0 mmol/L) had a hazard ratio for death of 1.81 (95% CI 1.49-2.20); for women the hazard ratio was 1.79 (1.18-2.69). For impaired fasting glucose (6.1-6.9 mmol/L), the hazard ratios were 1.21 (1.05-1.41) and 1.08 (0.70-1.66). For the WHO criteria (> or = 11.1 mmol/L), the ratios for newly diagnosed diabetes were 2.02 (1.66-2.46) in men and 2.77 (1.96-3.92) in women, and for impaired glucose tolerance (7.8-11.1 mmol/L) were 1.51 (1.32-1.72) and 1.60 (1.22-2.10). Within each fasting-glucose classification, mortality increased with increasing 2 h glucose. However, for 2 h glucose classifications of impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes, there was no trend for increasing fasting glucose concentrations.; Fasting-glucose concentrations alone do not identify individuals at increased risk of death associated with hyperglycaemia.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate insulin delivery, insulin sensitivity (SI), and glucose effectiveness (SG) in a group of elderly Type-2 diabetic patients (D, 4/6 F/M, age 67 +/- 2 years, 64 +/- 2 kg, BMI 23.8 +/- 0.5 kg/m2), compared to young controls (C, 4/6 F/M, 25 +/- 2 years, 72 +/- 4 kg, 23.7 +/- 1.1 kg/m2) and elderly controls (E, 2/4 F/M, 73 +/- 3 years, 63 +/- 4 kg, 23.1 +/- 0.5 kg/m2). We performed oral (OGTT) and intravenous (FSIGT) glucose tolerance tests. The OGTT showed that C and E were normotolerant, while D had a markedly reduced glucose tolerance. This was also confirmed in the FSIGT where the glucose tolerance index (KG) was 0.6 +/- 0.1% min-1 in D vs 1.8 +/- 0.2 in C and 1.5 +/- 0.2 in E (p < 0.0002). Total insulin area of D and the overall insulin delivery were not different from those of the control groups. The early phase area was instead significantly reduced (0.19 +/- 0.02 mU min/mL vs 0.61 +/- 0.06 of C and 0.46 +/- 0.06 of E, p < 0.001) given the reduction in the dynamic first-phase insulin delivery (0.86 +/- 0.17 min(microU/mL)/(mg/dL) vs 3.95 +/- 0.61 in C (p < 0.005) and 2.61 +/- 0.66 (p < 0.001) in E).

Baseline glucose was measured in a nonfasting state 1 h after a 50-g glucose load. History and use of medication for diabetes was obtained during an interview. The cohort was divided into four categories of glucose tolerance: low-normal, high-normal, asymptomatic hyperglycemia, and known diabetes.; During the 23 years of follow-up, 864 incident cases of CHD, 384 deaths from CHD, and 2,166 total deaths occurred. The relative risks (RRs) were obtained using Cox proportional hazards modeling, with the low-normal category as a reference. The RRs were adjusted for age only, as well as for age, BMI, hypertension, cholesterol, triglycerides, smoking, alcohol, and a Japanese diet index. The age-adjusted and risk factor-adjusted RRs for all outcomes were significant for the asymptomatic hyperglycemic and known diabetes groups (P<0.05). The age-adjusted RRs for CHD incidence and total mortality were marginally significant in the high-normal group, but the RRs were not significant when adjusted for risk factors.; These results suggest a dose-response relation of glucose intolerance at baseline with CHD incidence, CHD mortality, and total mortality, independent of other risk factors, in this cohort of middle-aged and older Japanese-American men.",E,E

The transport process responsible for this reabsorption has been investigated thus far only in laboratory animals. Here we report on the characteristics of carnitine uptake in a proximal tubular epithelial cell line derived from human kidney. The uptake process was found to be obligatorily dependent on Na+ with no involvement of anions. The process was saturable, with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 14 +/- 1 microM. The Na+:carnitine stoichiometry was 1:1. The same process also was found to be responsible for the uptake of acetylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine, two acyl esters of carnitine with potential for therapeutic use in humans. The uptake process was specific for carnitine and its acyl esters. Betaine, a structural analog of carnitine, interacted with the uptake process to a significant extent. The present studies also showed that sulfonylureas, oral hypoglycemic agents currently used in the management of type 2 diabetes, inhibited the carnitine uptake system. Among the sulfonylureas tested, glibenclamide was the most potent inhibitor. The inhibition was competitive. Glibenclamide inhibited the uptake not only of carnitine but also of acetylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine. The inhibition most likely was the result of direct interaction of the compound with the carnitine transporter because the inhibition could be demonstrated in purified rat kidney brush border membrane vesicles.",E,E

However, the sequence with which these abnormalities develop and their relative contributions to the deterioration in glucose tolerance remain unclear in the absence of a detailed longitudinal study. We measured insulin action, insulin secretion, and EGO longitudinally in 17 Pima Indians, in whom glucose tolerance deteriorated from normal (NGT) to impaired (IGT) to diabetic over 5.1 +/- 1.4 years. Transition from NGT to IGT was associated with an increase in body weight, a decline in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, and a decline in the acute insulin secretory response (AIR) to intravenous glucose, but no change in EGO. Progression from IGT to diabetes was accompanied by a further increase in body weight, further decreases in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and AIR, and an increase in basal EGO. Thirty-one subjects who retained NGT over a similar period also gained weight, but their AIR increased with decreasing insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. Thus, defects in insulin secretion and insulin action occur early in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Intervention to prevent diabetes should target both abnormalities.",E,E

It is rapidly absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of between 40 and 50%. Food increases the absorption by 30 to 80%. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are linear over the clinical dosage range of 200 to 600 mg once daily. The mean elimination half-life ranges from 7.6 to 24 hours, which facilitates a once daily administration regimen. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are similar between patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy individuals. In humans, troglitazone undergoes metabolism by sulfation, glucuronidation and oxidation to form a sulfate conjugate (M1), glucuronide conjugate (M2) and quinone metabolite (M3), respectively. M1 and M3 are the major metabolites in plasma, and M2 is a minor metabolite. Age, gender, type 2 diabetes, renal impairment, smoking and race do not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of troglitazone and its 2 major metabolites. In patients with hepatic impairment the plasma concentrations of troglitazone, M1 and M3 increase by 30%, 4-fold, and 2-fold, respectively. Cholestyramine decreases the absorption of troglitazone by 70%. Troglitazone may enhance the activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and/or transporter(s) thereby reducing the plasma concentrations of terfenadine, cyclosporin, atorvastatin and fexofenadine. It also reduces the plasma concentrations of the oral contraceptive hormones ethinylestradiol, norethindrone and levonorgestrel. Troglitazone does not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, glibenclamide (glyburide) or paracetamol (acetaminophen). There is no pharmacodynamic interaction between troglitazone and warfarin or alcohol (ethanol). Pharmacodynamic modelling showed that improvement in fasting glucose and triglyceride levels increased with dose from 200 to 600 mg. Knowledge of systemic troglitazone exposure within a dose group does not improve the prediction of glucose lowering response or adverse effects beyond those based on the administered dose.",E,E

On the morning of day 7, breakfast was omitted and the dose was given as an oral solution containing 2 mg of (14)C-repaglinide.; After oral dosing, a mean peak plasma concentration of repaglinide of 27.74 ng. ml(-1) (range: 16.84-36.65 ng. ml(-1)) was observed with a time to peak concentration of 0.5 h. Approximately 20% of repaglinide and its associated metabolites were distributed into red blood cells. No measurable (14)C-radioactivity was present in whole blood samples 6 h after dosing. Within 96 h of dosing with (14)C-repaglinide, 90% of the administered dose appeared in the faeces and 8% was excreted in urine. In the plasma, the major compound was repaglinide (61%). In the urine, the major metabolites were unidentified polar compounds, the aromatic amine (M(1)) (24%), and the dicarboxylic acid (M(2)) (22%). In the faeces, the major metabolite was M(2) (66% of administered dose). Therefore, repaglinide was excreted predominantly as metabolites and the major in vivo metabolite of repaglinide in humans was M(2). During regular dosing for 6 days, the morning plasma trough levels of repaglinide were, with very few exceptions, almost always too low to measure, indicating the absence of accumulation at this dose of 2 mg four times daily. Repaglinide was well tolerated, and there were no episodes of hypoglycaemia.; After oral dosing with repaglinide, the mean peak plasma concentration was rapidly attained and, thereafter, plasma concentrations decreased promptly. The major route of excretion was via the faeces. These properties make repaglinide a suitable insulin secretagogue for all patients with type-2 diabetes who retain sufficient beta-cell function.",E,E

Method The specific P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of rosiglitazone were determined by a combination of three approaches; multiple regression analysis of the rates of metabolism of rosiglitazone in human liver microsomes against selective P450 substrates, the effect of selective chemical inhibitors on rosiglitazone metabolism and the capability of expressed P450 enzymes to mediate the major metabolic routes of rosiglitazone metabolism. Result The major products of metabolism following incubation of rosiglitazone with human liver microsomes were para-hydroxy and N-desmethyl rosiglitazone. The rate of formation varied over 38-fold in the 47 human livers investigated and correlated with paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylation (P<0.001). Formation of these metabolites was inhibited significantly (>50%) by 13-cis retinoic acid, a CYP2C8 inhibitor, but not by furafylline, quinidine or ketoconazole. In addition, both metabolites were produced by microsomes derived from a cell line transfected with human CYP2C8 cDNA. There was some evidence for CYP2C9 playing a minor role in the metabolism of rosiglitazone. Sulphaphenazole caused limited inhibition (<30%) of both pathways in human liver microsomes and microsomes from cells transfected with CYP2C9 cDNA were able to mediate the metabolism of rosiglitazone, in particular the N-demethylation pathway, albeit at a much slower rate than CYP2C8. Rosiglitazone caused moderate inhibition of paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylase activity (CYP2C8; IC50=18 microm ), weak inhibition of tolbutamide hydroxylase activity (CYP2C9; IC50=50 microm ), but caused no marked inhibition of the other cytochrome P450 activities investigated (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A and 4A). Conclusion CYP2C8 is primarily responsible for the hydroxylation and N-demethylation of rosiglitazone in human liver; with minor contributions from CYP2C9.",E,E

The rate of decrease in glucose during exercise was higher (P < 0.05) on days with both glibenclamide and exercise, compared with days with glibenclamide alone and days with exercise alone (-0.035 +/- 0.009 vs. -0.016 +/- 0.002 and -0.022 +/- 0.005 mmol.l-1.min-1, respectively). Consequently, the glucose nadir was lower on days with glibenclamide and exercise than on days with glibenclamide or exercise alone (6.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 8.1 +/- 0.9 and 7.6 +/- 1.0 mmol/l, respectively; P < 0.05). During exercise, the rate of appearance of plasma glucose determined by 3-[3H]glucose infusion was lower on days with glibenclamide than on days without glibenclamide (2.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.1 mg.min-1.kg-1; P < 0.05). In contrast, glucose clearance was identical (P > 0.05).; In postabsorptive type 2 diabetic patients, the hypoglycemic action of glibenclamide and exercise is enhanced when the treatments are combined. The interaction reflects an increased inhibition by glibenclamide-enhanced insulin levels of hepatic glucose production when hepatic glucose production is accelerated by exercise.",E,E

This raises the possibility that glucose lowering agents with other nonglucose-lowering effects, might have added benefits. In this review, we focus on the metabolic and cardiovascular effects of oral antidiabetic agents that go beyond glucose-level lowering. Such effects include lipid modifying actions, antithrombotic and profibrinolytic activities, and direct action at the level of the vessel wall to improve endothelial function or prevent smooth muscle hyperplasia. These additional activities, particularly those seen with the newer oral antidiabetic agents, hold the promise of reducing cardiovascular complications beyond that achievable by glucose lowering alone.",E,E

10576528,Strategies for better diabetes control in the US.,"Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Texas; United States","Garber, A J","Recent surveys in the US have indicated that 71% of the total diabetes care is delivered by primary care physicians, and that current management practices in terms of the point of initiation of pharmacological treatment fall considerably short of the American Diabetes Association's recommendations. In part, this delay in initiating treatment is due to a fear of provoking hypoglycaemia, which in itself results from a general avoidance of blood glucose monitoring on the part of patients. As a consequence of this apparent disregard for diabetes care, blood glucose concentrations are not adequately controlled in the US and this is reflected in a high incidence of chronic complications, particularly diabetic neuropathy. This is likely to have major cost implications in the future. In an effort to improve the standard of diabetes care, a number of US authorities have begun producing guidelines for primary care physicians, and in the State of Texas, treatment algorithms that incorporate recommendations based on the current US registration trial data have been developed. These recommendations, which have now been adopted by the State of Texas and form part of the minimum standard of care mandated by the State Department of Health's Diabetes Council, provide guidance on the selection and use of oral antidiabetic drugs (including sulphonylureas, metformin, troglitazone, repaglinide and acarbose) in patients with type 2 diabetes, both for glycaemic control and for prevention of cardiovascular complications. It is hoped that organised implementation of these treatment algorithms will produce better control of diabetes and its complications than the current ad hoc strategies used by individual practitioners.",E,E

Nevertheless, these agents do cause hypoglycemia in clinical practice, suggesting that accompanying factors must typically be present for hypoglycemia to occur. Ethanol is one putative risk factor that has not been evaluated as a mechanism for low blood glucose among sulfonylurea users. We hypothesized that low concentrations of ethanol would reduce blood glucose concentrations in elderly type 2 diabetic patients receiving sulfonylureas during a short-term fast.; A total of 10 type 2 diabetic patients, aged 68 +/- 3 years and receiving 20 mg glyburide daily, participated in a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled in-patient study consisting of two 24-h fasts at least 1 week apart.

Ethanol, plasma glucose, insulin, and counterregulatory hormones were assessed very 30-60 min during the final 10 h of the fast.; Blood ethanol levels peaked at 17 +/- 2 mmol/l (the lower legal limit of intoxication in New Mexico) during the ethanol study. Plasma glucose concentrations did not differ at baseline (placebo 8.5 +/- 1.8 vs. ethanol 8.7 +/- 1.7 mmol/l; P = 0.50), but nadir plasma glucose was lower after the ethanol infusion compared with placebo (4.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 5.0 +/- 1.4 mmol/l; P = 0.01), and the absolute decline in plasma glucose was also greater during the ethanol study than the placebo study (4.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 3.6 +/- 1.2 mmol/l; P = 0.01). Counterregulatory hormone levels were increased during the ethanol study and nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were suppressed compared with the placebo study.; Low doses of ethanol predispose fasted elderly type 2 diabetic patients to low blood glucose during a short-term fast.

Its mechanism of action is partly similar to that of the sulphonylurea: the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells is stimulated by closure of ATP-dependent potassium channels. However, repaglinide regulates these channels via a different binding site on the beta cell than glibenclamide, and the drug does not cause insulin release in the absence of glucose, or during voltage-clamping. After oral administration the drug is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. It is therefore used in a meal-related dosing regimen; repaglinide is taken with each main meal. This meal-related use may give a more physiological mimick of daytime insulin requirement than once-daily or twice-daily use of sulphonylurea. Patients using repaglinide are less likely to develop hypoglycaemic symptoms when they miss or postpone a meal in comparison with patients on glibenclamide treatment. In long-term comparative phase 3 clinical studies it was found that repaglinide is equally effective in maintaining glycaemic control as existing sulphonylurea, but it gives significantly better control of postprandial blood glucose levels. Repaglinide can be used as monotherapy both in obese and non-obese type 2 diabetic patients, and is also very effective in combination with drugs like metformin or thiazolidines. Because of its excretion through liver and bile it is also an attractive drug for diabetic patients with diminished kidney function, especially the elderly diabetic. Although the overall incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar during use of repaglinide and of sulphonylurea, fewer serious hypoglycaemic episodes were observed in repaglinide-treated patients.",E,E

10641958,The use of sulphonylureas in the elderly.,"Aged; Aging; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Sulfonylurea Compounds","Graal, M B; Wolffenbuttel, B H","Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disorder characterised by defects in insulin secretion as well as reduced insulin action. During aging, glucose intolerance will gradually develop, and this is manifested primarily by an increase in the postprandial blood glucose response while fasting blood glucose levels are often less elevated. Abnormal beta-cell secretion of insulin is a main feature of this. Treatment of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus focuses on reduction of (hyperglycaemic) complaints and prevention of the development or progression of secondary complications. Although regular physical activity and dietary measures, aiming at bodyweight normalisation, are the cornerstones of therapy, pharmacological treatment with oral blood glucose lowering-agents often proves necessary to control the hyperglycaemia. In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) it was clearly shown that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were intensively treated with oral blood glucose-lowering agents or insulin developed less microvascular complications. The question whether achievement of strict metabolic control is also of benefit in elderly patients, is still unanswered. Sulphonylureas are drugs which stimulate insulin secretion by enhancing the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta-cells without an effect on insulin synthesis. They are frequently used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and several preparations are available. In general, there are no major differences in effectiveness between the various sulphonylureas. Long term treatment with sulphonylureas will decrease fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels by 3 to 5 mmol/L, and glycosylated haemoglobin by 20%. However, after its initial decline, plasma glucose level will often go up slightly during the following months to years. Sulphonylureas are usually well tolerated. Hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring adverse effect, which may be very serious and damaging in the elderly. It has been associated primarily with long-acting sulphonylureas, like chlorpropamide and glibenclamide (glyburide). Hypoglycaemic episodes may trigger serious events like myocardial infarction or stroke. Therefore, shorter-acting compounds like tolbutamide and gliclazide have been relatively well tolerated and appear to be the best choice to treat elderly patients. It is advisable to start with a low dose and increase the dose, when needed, in small steps. The efficacy of sulphonylureas is much greater when they are taken before a meal. Because of the fact that type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive disease, and residual beta-cell function decreases with time, insulin therapy may ultimately be warranted in a significant number of patients.",E,E

Results showed that the benefits of glycemic control have been established through multiple clinical trials. Long-term control of blood glucose levels in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients will decrease the incidence and prolong the time until progression of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Our increased understanding of the pathophysiology behind type 2 diabetes has led to the development of many new agents that are aimed at treating the underlying insulin resistance and relative insulinopenia. The sulfonylureas as a group have been used for many years and act by stimulating insulin secretion. They are useful alone or as combination therapy with insulin or another oral hypoglycemic agent. The biguanides act by decreasing hepatic glucose production and by increasing peripheral insulin sensitivity. The alpha-glucosidase inhibitors act nonsystemically by blocking the metabolism of digested polysaccharides and therefore lowering the amount of carbohydrate absorbed in a meal. Benzoic acid derivatives act in a manner similar to that of sulfonylureas by enhancing pancreatic insulin production. They offer a shorter duration of action, lowering the risk of hypoglycemia. The thiazolidinediones increase peripheral insulin sensitivity and are effective as both monotherapy and combination therapy. Oral hypoglycemic agents, when properly administered, are very effective in controlling type 2 diabetes and preventing long-term complications.",E,E

There are ethnic differences in both the prevalence and metabolic characteristics of the disease. Important interethnic pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences have been reported for several drugs. With few exceptions, detailed studies on sulphonylurea are lacking.; The patients were studied on two occasions when either no Gb (control) or 1.25 mg Gb was administered i.v., immediately before the administration of a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Concentrations of insulin and proinsulin were determined by means of radioimmunoassay without cross-reactivities. Gb concentration was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacodynamic results were calculated using net areas under the curves, with basal values set as zero. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.; When glucose was administered orally without Gb, Chinese patients had higher plasma glucose increases at 10 min (7.6 mmol/l x min vs 2.6 mmol/l x min) and higher increases of plasma insulin levels than Caucasians at both 10 min (198 pmol/l x min vs 54 pmol/l x min) and 30 min (2286 pmol/l x min vs 1198 pmol/l x min). When Gb was administered, the plasma glucose increases were reduced, and the increases of serum insulin and proinsulin levels were greater in both ethnic groups. Compared with the basal values (-1 min), proinsulin/insulin ratios (RPI) were lowest at 10-30 min, followed by an increase. Chinese patients had higher increases of serum insulin levels at 10 min (1109 pmol/l x min vs 550 pmol/l x min) and a lower RPI at 30 min (6. 0% vs 7.6%) and 240 min (15.0% vs 21.0%) relative to Caucasians. Serum Gb data were best fitted to a biexponential i.v. model. There were no interethnic differences in any of the pharmacokinetic parameters.; In summary, following oral glucose administration without Gb, Chinese type-2 diabetic patients had higher plasma insulin levels but also higher plasma glucose levels during the first 10 min, which might reflect reduced insulin sensitivity or more rapid glucose absorption. Gb augmented glucose-induced release of both insulin and proinsulin in both ethnic groups; the effect on insulin secretion was more pronounced. In conclusion, minor pharmacodynamic but no pharmacokinetic differences were found between the two groups. It seems appropriate to employ the same dosage principles when using Gb in Caucasians and Chinese.",I,I

Adverse events (principally hypoglycemia) were similar in the two groups; none was serious. Repaglinide clearance is significantly reduced in patients with hepatic impairment; the agent should be used with caution in this group.",I,I

New oral agents give a wider segment of the population with type 2 diabetes hope of achieving near-normal blood-glucose levels. Troglitazone, a novel chemical entity, is one promising new agent.; We conducted an economic analysis based on glycemic-control data from a randomized clinical trial comparing troglitazone with placebo, each added to glyburide. A patient simulation model was used to translate these data to long-term outcomes associated with diabetes. Patients had poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus despite glyburide therapy. Risk functions of developing and progressing through nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, hypoglycemia, and macrovascular disease were developed from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and large epidemiologic studies. Cost estimates were based on data from 5 states, all payor databases, surveys, and literature. The main outcomes of the model were cost-consequences, number of patients developing each type of complication, mean time to development of the complication, cost per life-year gained (LYG), and cost per quality-adjusted life-year.; The model predicts that for every 1000 patients treated with troglitazone, the improved glycemic control could mean that 95 to 140 fewer patients would experience one of the most severe diabetic complications (eg, blindness, end-stage renal disease, amputation), which may increase life expectancy by 2.0 years. These benefits are obtained at an additional $2100 per LYG (undiscounted). The ratio remains <$50,000 per LYG for most variations in input.; The clinical trial demonstrated that troglitazone + glyburide improves glycemic control compared with glyburide alone. Based on these results, the model estimates fewer diabetic complications at a cost well below accepted cost-effective thresholds.",E,E

No further gliclazide was given over the next 48 h. Regular blood samples were drawn for serum glucose, insulin and gliclazide assay. Gliclazide was measured using h.p.l.c. Noncompartmental analysis was used to describe primary data. A multicompartment model incorporating entero-hepatic recirculation was fitted to group mean serum gliclazide profiles.; The Caucasians were older than the Aborigines (mean +/- s.d. age 53.4 +/- 12.2 vs 40.3 +/- 6.9 years, P < 0.05) but had similar diabetes duration, body mass index and glycated haemoglobin. Noncompartmental analysis revealed no between-group differences in gliclazide kinetics. Post-breakfast serum glucose and insulin responses were also similar apart from a longer time to maximum concentration (tmax) for glucose amongst the Aborigines (2.6 +/- 0.4 vs 2.2 +/- 0. 3 h in Caucasians; P = 0.024). Gliclazide tmax exhibited a skewed unimodal distribution and was not associated with gliclazide maximum concentration, or glucose or insulin responses. Most patients had a serum gliclazide profile suggestive of enterohepatic recirculation and/or biphasic absorption. Model-derived estimates of the extent of putative enterohepatic recirculation were 30% and 20% of dose in Caucasians and Aborigines, respectively.; Gliclazide is equally effective in Caucasian and Aboriginal diabetic patients. The pharmacokinetics of oral gliclazide appear more complex than previously thought. Gliclazide pharmacodynamics are unrelated to rate and extent of absorption, consistent with a threshold concentration for hypoglycaemic effect.",I,I

Besides insulin, four different oral antidiabetic drug categories are available, each of them acting through different and potentially synergistic ways. Oral antidiabetic drugs include: 1) biguanides acting through the reduction of hepatic glucose production and are most efficient in obese patients; 2) alpha-glucosidase inhibitors delaying carbohydrate intestinal absorption; 3) thiazolidinediones or ""glitazones"", acting as insulin sensitizers; 4) insulin secretion enhancers, mainly including sulfonylureas, which increase insulin secretion and are being credited by a long clinical usage; these are now joined by the new generation of insulin secretion enhancers, led by repaglinide, which can mimic the physiological insulin secretion profile by a specific stimulatory effect on beta-cells characterized by its fast onset and short half-life.

Glycemic control was assessed using 4 methods: 1) quarterly fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose after a standard breakfast; 2) insulin and glucose response to Sustacal (test meal) challenge every 3 to 6 months; 3) quarterly hemoglobin A1c; and 4) intravenous glucose tolerance testing every 6 months to measure first and second phase insulin secretion.

There was greater reduction in FPG and 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose with glipizide than with glyburide in 6 months. Contrary to the Physicians' Desk Reference, but consistent with another short-term study, our long-term study demonstrated that glipizide and glyburide are equipotent at similar doses in controlling hyperglycemia in DM2.; Glipizide and glyburide are effective in controlling hyperglycemia with similar doses in DM2.

This oral antihyperglycaemic agent is indicated for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Miglitol is generally well tolerated and, unlike the sulphonylurea agents, is not associated with bodyweight gain or hypoglycaemia when administered as monotherapy. The drug is systemically absorbed but is not metabolised and is rapidly excreted via the kidneys. Clinical trials with miglitol (usually 50 or 100 mg 3 times daily) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus consistently demonstrated a significant improvement in glycaemic control for periods of 6 to 12 months. There were also marked reductions in postprandial serum insulin levels, although miglitol generally had no effect on fasting insulin levels. In comparative studies miglitol had similar efficacy to acarbose, but at lower therapeutic doses (50 and 100 mg 3 times daily, respectively). In addition, although sulphonylurea agents provided superior reductions in HbA1c levels, miglitol provided similar or superior reductions in fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels. In combination with other oral antidiabetic agents or insulin, miglitol improved glycaemic control in patients in whom metabolic control was suboptimal despite dietary and pharmacological intervention. Most adverse events associated with miglitol treatment involve disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract (most common effects are flatulence, abdominal pain and diarrhoea). These symptoms are usually dose dependent, mild to moderate in severity, occur at the onset of treatment, decline with time and resolve promptly on discontinuation of the drug or with dosage adjustment. As monotherapy, miglitol is not associated with hypoglycaemia, but concomitant use with other oral antidiabetic agents may necessitate dosage adjustment of the other agents. Miglitol had no significant effects on renal, cardiovascular, respiratory or haematological parameters in long term studies. No dosage adjustments are required in elderly patients, in those with hepatic impairment or in those with mild to moderate renal insufficiency.; In long term, well designed trials miglitol reduces fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels, thus improving glycaemic control, which is reflected in a reduced HbA1c level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Most adverse events associated with miglitol involve disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract. This agent is a useful first-line therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus insufficiently controlled by diet alone and as second-line or as adjuvant therapy in those insufficiently controlled with diet and sulphonylurea agents. Miglitol may prove particularly beneficial in elderly patients and those with hepatic impairment or mild to moderate renal impairment, in whom other oral antidiabetic agents are contraindicated or need to be used with caution.",E,E

The available data suggest that the target cholesterol concentration in patients with diabetes should be similar to that in non-diabetic individuals with a previous myocardial infarction. This led us to investigate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of a new, highly potent statin, cerivastatin, in diabetic hyperlipidaemia.; This was a multinational, multicentre, double-blind, randomized study in type 2 diabetic patients with hypercholesterolaemia (LDL cholesterol >3.35 mmol/l; triglycerides <4.56 mmol/l).

10820647,Recent developments and emerging therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents","Evans, A J; Krentz, A J","Most patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus require pharmacotherapy, initially as monotherapy and subsequently in combination, as adjuncts to diet and exercise. Exogenous insulin is ultimately required in a substantial proportion, reflecting the progressive natural history of the disease. Sulphonylureas and biguanides have been employed for over 4 decades as oral antidiabetic agents, but they have a limited capacity to provide long term glycaemic control and can cause serious adverse effects. Thus, more efficacious and tolerable antidiabetic agents are required. Recent years have witnessed the introduction of agents with novel modes of action, that is, the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors acarbose and miglitol (which reduce postprandial hyperglycaemia) and the first of the thiazolidinedione insulinsensitising drugs--troglitazone and rosiglitazone. Although the former has been withdrawn in some countries due to adverse effects, another 'glitazone' pioglitazone is expected to be approved in the near future. Other recently introduced drugs include glimepiride and the meglitinide insulin secretagogue, repaglinide. Attention is also focusing increasingly on combination therapy using insulin together with sulphonylureas, metformin or troglitazone. Rapid-acting insulin analogues are now being used as alternatives to conventional insulins; their role in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus is presently uncertain but reports of a reduced frequency of hypoglycaemia are encouraging. The development of new drugs aims to counter the principal metabolic defects of the disorder, respectively, relative insulin deficiency and insulin resistance. Novel classes of rapid-acting secretagogues under evaluation include the morphilinoguanide BTS 67582 and the meglitinides mitiglinide (KAD 1229) and senaglinide (A-4166). Succinate ester derivatives represent a potential novel approach to improving beta-cell function through enhancement of insulin biosynthesis and secretion. Enhancement of nutrient-induced insulin secretion is a mechanism with several putative targets within the beta-cell; potentiators of insulin secretion include glucagon-like peptide-1 and its analogues, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and the imidazoline derivative PMS 812 (S 21663). The amylin agonist pramlintide slows gastric emptying and suppression of glucagon secretion. Non-thiazolidinedione insulin-sensitising agents include the gamma-receptor agonist G 1262570X (GG 570) and D-chiro-inositol. Insulin analogues with prolonged action and inhaled insulin preparations are also under investigation. Insulin-mimetic agents include organic vanadium compounds. Whether newer agents will offer clinically relevant efficacy and tolerability advantages over existing therapies remains to be determined.",E,E

After the subjects underwent an overnight fast, blood sampling was initiated and continued every minute for 120 min. After 40 min, a single dose (0.5 mg) of repaglinide or placebo was given. Serum insulin-concentration time series were assessed by deconvolution analyses and the regularity statistic by approximate entropy (ApEn).; Average insulin concentration was increased after repaglinide administration (basal vs. stimulated period, P values are placebo vs. repaglinide) (25.1 +/- 3.6 vs. 33.5 +/- 4.1 pmol/l, P < 0.001).

OHA decreased FSG (9+/-1 mmol/l) and 3MH and increased plasma insulin-to-glucose ratio, nitrogen retention, and S-B to levels in control subjects. The change in S-B correlated with that in FSG (r = -0.845, P = 0.001) and in fasting plasma C-peptide (r = 0.852, P = 0.0005). With LED and OHA, weight decreased 6.3 kg, glycemia reached near-normal levels, and nitrogen equilibrium was maintained; Q decreased by 7%, S and B by 11% (P<0.05) to values found in control subjects.; OHA during ISO corrected protein turnover in relation to glycemia and plasma C-peptide. The LED maintained protein homeostasis in obese control subjects and, in diabetes patients with OHA, normalized protein metabolism.

Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) and frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests (FSIGTs) were conducted on Latino women with impaired glucose tolerance and a history of gestational diabetes before and after 12 weeks of treatment with 400 mg/day troglitazone (n = 13) or placebo (n = 12). Insulin sensitivity was assessed by minimal model analysis, and beta-cell insulin release was assessed as acute insulin responses to glucose (AIRg) and tolbutamide (AIRt) during FSIGTs and as the 30-min incremental insulin response (30-min dINS) during OGTTs. Beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance was assessed as the product (disposition index) of minimal model insulin sensitivity and each of the 3 measures of beta-cell insulin release. In the placebo group, there was no significant change in insulin sensitivity or in any measure of insulin release, beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance, or glucose tolerance. Troglitazone treatment resulted in a significant increase in insulin sensitivity, as reported previously. In response, AIRg did not change significantly, so that the disposition index for AIRg increased significantly from baseline (P = 0.004) and compared with placebo (P = 0.02). AIRt (P = 0.001) and 30-min dINS (P = 0.02) fell with improved insulin sensitivity during troglitazone treatment, so that the disposition index for each of these measures of beta-cell function did not change significantly from baseline (P > 0.20) or compared with placebo (P > 0.3). Minimal model analysis revealed that 89% of the change from baseline in insulin sensitivity during troglitazone treatment was accounted for by lowered plasma insulin concentrations. Neither oral nor intravenous glucose tolerance changed significantly from baseline or compared with placebo during troglitazone treatment. The predominant response of beta-cells to improved insulin sensitivity in women at high risk for type 2 diabetes was a reduction in insulin release to maintain nearly constant glucose tolerance.",E,E

The aim of this article is to briefly review the various therapeutic agents available for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to suggest a potential approach to drug selection. There are three general therapeutic modalities relevant to diabetes care. The first modality is lifestyle adjustments aimed at improving endogenous insulin sensitivity or insulin effect. This can be achieved by increased physical activity and bodyweight reduction with diet and behavioural modification, and the use of pharmacological agents or surgery. This first modality is not discussed in depth in this article. The second modality involves increasing insulin availability by the administration of exogenous insulin, insulin analogues, sulphonylureas and the new insulin secretagogue, repaglinide. The most frequently encountered adverse effect of these agents is hypoglycaemia. Bodyweight gain can also be a concern, especially in patients who are obese. The association between hyperinsulinaemia and premature atherosclerosis is still a debatable question. The third modality consists of agents such as biguanides and thiazolidinediones which enhance insulin sensitivity, or agents that decrease insulin requirements like the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disease with multiple underlying pathophysiological processes. Therapy should be individualised based on the degree of hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia or insulin deficiency. In addition, several factors have to be considered when prescribing a specific therapeutic agent. These factors include efficacy, safety, affordability and ease of administration.",I,I

Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the variant in 2 other Danish population samples that comprised 356 young healthy subjects and 226 glucose-tolerant offspring of type 2 diabetic probands, respectively. In all of the study populations, the polymorphism was not associated with an altered insulin sensitivity index as estimated from an intravenous glucose tolerance test in combination with an intravenous injection of tolbutamide. In addition, among the 226 offspring, the variations in serum insulin and serum C-peptide responses measured during an OGTT were not related to the PC-1 genotype.

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, led by acarbose, mainly address postprandial glucose control. These agents inhibit intestinal disaccharidases through a competitive effect and can be used either as the sole treatment or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs. Other agents improve insulin secretion kinetics. This is the case for repaglinide et nateglinide, which are efficient in controlling postprandial blood glucose, and to a lesser degree, fasting blood glucose. These agents shortly and quickly stimulate insulin secretion and should be available soon. In oral therapy secondary failures, trials are currently being conducted to clarify the role of fast-acting insulin analogs, as monotherapy or in combination. Finally, insulin sensitizing agents are being investigated as a way to improve postprandial glucose efflux by potentiating insulin effects. The optimal strategy for the use of these different therapeutic agents remains to be established, as well as their long-term effects on diabetic complications.",E,E

Pioglitazone activates the nuclear peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), which leads to the increased transcription of various proteins regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. These proteins amplify the post-receptor actions of insulin in the liver and peripheral tissues, which leads to improved glycaemic control with no increase in the endogenous secretion of insulin. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, monotherapy with pioglitazone 15 to 45 mg/day has been shown to decrease blood glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The addition of pioglitazone 30 mg/day to preexisting therapy with metformin, or of pioglitazone 15 or 30 mg/day to sulphonylurea, insulin or voglibose therapy, has been shown to decrease HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels significantly in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pioglitazone has also been associated with improvements in serum lipid profiles in randomised placebo-controlled clinical studies. The drug has been well tolerated by adult patients of all ages in clinical studies. Oedema has been reported with monotherapy, and pooled data have shown hypoglycaemia in 2 to 15% of patients after the addition of pioglitazone to sulphonylurea or insulin treatment. There have been no reports of hepatotoxicity.",E,E

PATIENTS were tested monthly for circadian blood glucose profiles and glycosylated hemoglobin. Mild hypoglycaemia was defined on the basis of blood glucose values < 2.8 mmol/l associated with mild autonomic symptoms, without requiring external assistance. Each diabetic patient filled personal diary indicating the therapy regimen and the characteristics of eventual hypoglycaemic episodes occurring during the observation period.; 21.8% of NIDDM patients experienced one or two episodes of mild hypoglycaemia during the observation period. The analysis of the patients' diaries showed that 60% of the hypoglycaemic episodes was associated with excessive, prolonged and unexpected physical exertions. Within this group, about 70% of the episodes occurred during a holiday (""holiday hypoglycaemia""). After analyzing the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the diabetic patients reporting hypoglycaemic events, we found a higher risk for ""holiday hypoglycaemia"" in patients with a lower educational level, with a sedentary occupation or among the ex-farmers.; As resulted in the present study, unexpected physical exertions may represent a relevant cause of mild hypoglycaemia in diabetic patients receiving oral antidiabetic therapy. However, this hypoglycaemic cause may have been underestimated in the literature. Educational programs conducted by general practitioners or diabetologists could be useful for the patients in reducing the number of mild hypoglycaemic episodes.",E,E

Nateglinide reduces fasting and mealtime blood glucose levels in animals, healthy volunteers, and patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, and produces prompt prandial insulin responses with return to baseline insulin levels between meals. In randomised, double-blind 24-week studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, oral nateglinide 120 mg 3 times daily before meals improved glycaemic control significantly relative to placebo. Nateglinide 120 mg plus metformin 500 mg, both 3 times daily, conferred greater glycaemic improvement than either drug given alone, and nateglinide 60 or 120 mg 3 times daily plus metformin 1 g twice daily was superior to metformin plus placebo. Nateglinide 120 mg 3 times daily significantly reduced hyperglycaemia relative to placebo in a 16-week double-blind study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Combination therapy with troglitazone 600 mg daily produced significantly better glycaemic control than either drug given as monotherapy.

Suppressing postprandial hyperglycemia is considered to be very important for preventing diabetic complications. Sulfonylureas are well-known insulin secretagogues and have been widely used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. These agents, however, do not appear to be able to ameliorate impairment of the first phase of insulin secretion and postprandial hyperglycemia. Nateglinide, which is a derivative of D-phenylalanine, is a non-sulfonylurea insulin secretagogue. Although the in vitro insulin-releasing effect of nateglinide is similar to that of sulfonylureas, its hypoglycemic effect is more rapid and short lasting. The in vivo unique pharmacodynamic profile of nateglinide is likely to result from its rapid absorption and elimination. This novel antidiabetic agent has made it possible to compensate for the impaired first phase insulin response and thus suppresses postprandial hyperglycemia. In clinical trials, nateglinide reduced prandial glucose excursion and improved early phase of insulin release dose-dependently after 12 weeks treatment. Nateglinide is a highly physiologic mealtime glucose regulator, which rapidly increases insulin secretion when taken before meals, mimicking early-phase insulin release lost in patients with Type 2 diabetes.",E,E

The women were randomly assigned between 11 and 33 weeks of gestation to receive glyburide or insulin according to an intensified treatment protocol. The primary end point was achievement of the desired level of glycemic control. Secondary end points included maternal and neonatal complications.; The mean (+/-SD) pretreatment blood glucose concentration as measured at home for one week was 114+/-19 mg per deciliter (6.4+/-1.1 mmol per liter) in the glyburide group and 116+/-22 mg per deciliter (6.5+/-1.2 mmol per liter) in the insulin group (P=0.33). The mean concentrations during treatment were 105+/-16 mg per deciliter (5.9+/-0.9 mmol per liter) in the glyburide group and 105+/-18 mg per deciliter (5.9+/-1.0 mmol per liter) in the insulin group (P=0.99).

Prandial glucose regulation is aimed at restoring the first-phase insulin response that follows consumption of a meal, which is missing in patients with Type 2 diabetes. After repaglinide administration, the resulting insulin profile reflects that of healthy individuals more closely, providing tighter glycaemic control and reducing the risk of hypoglycaemic events. Repaglinide is quickly absorbed and rapidly eliminated through biliary excretion, making it suitable for use in patients with renal impairment. It appears in the bloodstream within 15 to 30 min of dosing, stimulating short-term insulin release from the pancreatic beta-cells by binding to a unique site on the beta-cell membrane. Rapid elimination ensures that postprandial insulin levels quickly return to preprandial levels as the high prandial glucose level subsides. Repaglinide is given on a 'one meal, one tablet; no meal, no tablet' basis. It is particularly effective in patients who have not previously been treated with an oral antidiabetic agent, significantly reducing glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels by 1.6%. It also offers increased mealtime flexibility and safety, compared with other oral antidiabetic agents. As a result of the short plasma half-life and lack of accumulation of repaglinide with repeated dosing, the risk of between-meal and nocturnal hypoglycaemia is substantially reduced compared with other oral antidiabetic agents. Repaglinide acts synergistically with metformin, consistently improving glycaemic control in patients who were insufficiently controlled by metformin alone. Results from recent studies have shown similar synergistic effects with neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH)-insulin or troglitazone.",I,I

The newest approach to oral antidiabetic therapy is to target improvements in insulin sensitivity at muscle, adipose tissue and hepatic level.

Both epidemiological and prospective data have demonstrated that treatment of hyperglycaemia is markedly effective in reducing the risk of microvascular disease but is less potent in reducing that of myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Treatment of other cardiovascular risk factors, although by definition less prevalent than hyperglycaemia, appears to be more effective in preventing macrovascular disease than treatment of hyperglycaemia. In recent years, data from intervention trials have suggested that greater benefits with respect to the prevention of macrovascular disease can be achieved by effective treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, and by the use of small doses of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) than by treating hyperglycaemia alone. On the other hand, the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), which examined the impact of intensive glucose and blood pressure (BP) control on micro- and macrovascular complications, is the only intervention trial to include only patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The UKPDS data, the epidemic increase in the number of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and their high cardiovascular risk have, however, initiated several new trials addressing, in particular, the possible benefits of treatment of the most common form of dyslipidaemia (high serum triglyceride and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels) in these patients.

The emergency physician routinely is expected to treat a wide range of problems related to this disease, including making the initial diagnosis of type 2 and occasionally type 1 diabetes. Also common are patients with poorly controlled diabetes. The recent introduction of new classes of agents to lower blood glucose, especially in type 2 diabetes, should improve the control in this category of patient and reduce the complication rate. Some of these agents, such as troglitazone, have potentially fatal complications and require careful monitoring. Emergency physicians should be aware of the common complications of these drugs because patients can present to the ED with them. Hypoglycemia, a common cause of 911 calls and emergency visits, is not a side effect of either metformin or acarbose. Insulin lispro has improved postprandial glycemic control for type 1 and some insulin-requiring type 2 diabetics. Hypoglycemia is less of a risk with insulin lispro, and quality of life is better with this rapidly acting insulin. Newer methods of insulin delivery, such as continuous subcutaneous infusion, have greatly improved glucose control, given greater freedom to patients, and reduced the risks of hypoglycemia.",I,I

No significant differences in the blood glucose response to glimepiride were observed between the placebo and rifampicin phases. However, symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred only during the placebo phase.; The effects of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride suggest that rifampicin induced the CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of glimepiride and thereby slightly increased its systemic clearance.

The high prevalence of this phenomenon in this high-risk population suggests that screening for LVDD in type 2 diabetes should include procedures such as the Valsalva maneuver and pulmonary venous recordings to unmask a pseudonormal pattern of ventricular filling.",E,E

They received single 10-min preprandial doses of 120 mg nateglinide, 0.5 or 2 mg repaglinide, or placebo or 1 min preprandially of 2 mg repaglinide. Subjects received each dose only once, 48 h apart. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic assessments were performed from 0 to 12 h postdose.; Nateglinide induced insulin secretion more rapidly than 2 and 0.5 mg repaglinide and placebo (10 min preprandial), with mean rates of insulin rise of 2.3, 1.3, 1.15, and 0.8 microU x ml(-1) x min(-1), respectively, over the 0- to 30-min postmeal interval. After peaking, insulin concentrations decreased rapidly in the nateglinide-treated group and were similar to placebo within 2 h postdose. After 2 mg repaglinide, peak insulin concentrations were delayed and returned to baseline more slowly than with nateglinide treatment. Nateglinide treatment produced lower average plasma glucose concentrations in the 0- to 2-h postdose interval than either dose of repaglinide and placebo (P < 0.05 vs. 0.5 mg repaglinide and placebo). Plasma glucose concentrations returned more rapidly to predose levels with nateglinide treatment than with either dose of repaglinide. Treatment with repaglinide produced a sustained hypoglycemic effect up to 6 h postdose.; In this single-dose study in nondiabetic volunteers, nateglinide provided a more rapid and shorter-lived stimulation of insulin secretion than repaglinide, resulting in lower meal-related glucose excursions. If similar results are observed in diabetes, nateglinide may produce a more physiological insulin secretory response with the potential for a reduced risk of postabsorptive hypoglycemia.",I,I

Several clinical trials have shown that some of the major complications of diabetes mellitus can be partially prevented or delayed by intensive glycaemic control. However, there are benefits and risks in aiming for near normal blood glucose levels. Intensive glycaemic control delays the onset and progression of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. Epidemiological and observational studies have shown that cardiovascular events may be correlated with the severity and duration of diabetes mellitus, but major randomised trials have only shown weak and nonsignificant benefits of intensive glycaemic management in decreasing event rates. A modest improvement in lipid profile results from blood glucose control although, in the majority of cases, not enough to reach current targets. Detrimental effects of intensive glycaemic control include bodyweight gain and hypoglycaemia. Controversial issues in the management of patients with diabetes mellitus include the unproven increase in cardiovascular morbidity from sulphonylureas and hyperinsulinaemia, and the still unknown long term effects of newer oral antihyperglycaemic agents alone or in combination with traditional therapies (such as sulphonylureas and metformin). It is important to individualise management in setting glycaemic goals. Control of cardiovascular risk factors through blood pressure and lipid control and treatment with aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and ACE inhibitors have consistently shown benefits in the prevention of both macro- and microvascular complications in patients with diabetes mellitus; these measures deserve priority.",I,I

The restoration of endogenous rapid insulin secretion after oral glucose load was established for the first time by using nateglinide, which is a newly developed insulin secretagogue, in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was clearly demonstrated that with nateglinide, serum insulin levels were quickly raised, and glycemic response curves were almost normalized with the same amount of insulin secretion during 180 min. Therefore, the lack of rapid, pulsatile secretion of insulin in response to glycemic rise after oral glucose load, rather than insulin resistance, is responsible for postprandial glycemic response in obese type 2 diabetes patients.",I,I

There were no significant interethnic differences in Gb or Gz effects whether on glucose, insulin or proinsulin/insulin ratio at any time point. Following Gz, however, Chinese patients had greater increments of serum proinsulin at 10-30 min compared with Caucasians. Apart from the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of Gz being higher among the Chinese, no significant interethnic differences in pharmacokinetics were found.

Diet and antihyperglycaemic medication, aiming at FBG < 6.7 mmol/l, was maintained for 6 months after completed dose titration in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial with metformin (M), glibenclamide (G) and primary combination of both drugs (MG). The study compared M, G and MG in low dose (MGL) and also different high-dose regimens, i.e. G added to M (M/G), M added to G (G/M) and primary combination (MGH). Outcome measures were fasting proinsulin, glycaemia, body mass index, blood pressure, lipids, insulin and C-peptide.; Lower proinsulin levels were found when therapy was initiated with metformin (M vs. G, p = 0.013 and M/G vs. G/M, p = 0.033).

Proinsulin was associated with cardiovascular risk factors, linking high proinsulin to an atherogenic risk marker profile. Mean proinsulin change from baseline was inconsistently associated with markers of insulin resistance. Meal-stimulated glucose (net AUC) decreased after treatment only in those with low baseline proinsulin levels.; It may be advantageous to initiate oral antihyperglycaemic therapy with metformin rather than with sulphonylurea. High proinsulin levels are associated with an atherogenic-risk marker profile and an impaired therapeutic postprandial glucose response after treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes. Proinsulin change after therapy is inconsistently associated with markers of insulin resistance and unrelated to fasting blood glucose reduction.",E,E
11232737,Management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly: special considerations.,"Aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Therapy, Combination; Geriatrics; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Sulfonylurea Compounds","Rosenstock, J","The principles of managing type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly are no different from those in younger patients, but the priorities and therapeutic strategies need to be cautiously individualised. The objectives of treatment are to improve glycaemic control in a stepwise approach that involves nonpharmacological methods including diet and exercise, and pharmacological therapy including mixtures of oral antihyperglycaemic agents alone or in combination with insulin. Although the goals of treatment may be the same for elderly and younger patients, certain aspects of type 2 diabetes in the elderly require special consideration. Treatment decisions are influenced by age and life expectancy, comorbid conditions and severity of the vascular complications. Adherence to dietary therapy, physical activity, and medication regimens may be compromised by comorbid conditions and psychosocial limitations. Drug-induced hypoglycaemia has been the main consideration and the most serious potential complication. In addition, the long term macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes are a source of significant morbidity and mortality. Indeed, vascular and neuropathic complications are already present at the time of diagnosis in a significant number of patients, and the impact of improved diabetes control depends on the age and life expectancy of the patient. Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and the potential for adverse effects and drug interactions should also be considered when choosing appropriate pharmacological therapy. In general, a conservative and stepwise approach to the treatment of the elderly patient with type 2 diabetes is suggested; treatment may be initiated with monotherapy, followed by early intervention with a combination of oral agents including a sulphonylurea as a foundation insulin secretagogue in addition to a supplemental insulin sensitiser. Insulin therapy is eventually required if significant hyperglycaemia [glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) >8%] persists despite oral combination therapy. Combination therapy with evening insulin and a long-acting sulphonylurea such as glimepiride is an effective strategy to improve hyperglycaemia in the elderly patient with type 2 diabetes in whom polypharmacy with oral agents is unsuccessful. In addition, such a regimen is simple to follow for the patient who may not be able to adhere to a more complicated insulin regimen. Hyperglycaemia in the elderly can be managed well with practical intervention and a straightforward treatment plan to enhance compliance. Optimal glycaemic control should be possible for every patient if treatment is individualised; however, strict glycaemic control may not be achievable in all patients or even desirable in many elderly patients.",I,I

At baseline and 12 weeks thereafter we measured body mass index (BMI), serum insulin, blood glucose, lipid profile, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and urine albumin.; We studied 23 patients in the glibenclamide group and 28 in the metformin group. There was no difference in baseline variables between the groups. Metabolic control was obtained in both groups. In the metformin group, all the following variables decreased: microalbuminuria was reduced by a mean of 24.2 mg/day (p = 0.008); systolic and diastolic blood pressure by a mean of 5.3 mmHg (p = 0.002) and 3.93 mmHg (p = 0.009), respectively; insulin levels by an average of 11.8 microIU/mL (p = 0.001), and total cholesterol levels and triglycerides by an average of 0.45 and 0.18 mmol/L, respectively. Insulin resistance measured by the homeostasis model decreased more in the metformin group than in the glibenclamide group. Patients treated with glibenclamide had an increase in HDL cholesterol of 0.082 mmol/L (p = 0.01).; Metformin significantly decreased the urine albumin excretion rate with none of the expected changes in renal hemodynamics, probably due to its favorable effects on blood pressure, lipid profile, metabolic control, and insulin resistance.",E,E

Furthermore, we showed that obese normoglycemic family members of a type 2 diabetic proband failed to compensate for the insulin resistance of obesity by increasing insulin secretion. In this study, we tested the primary hypotheses that previously described variants in the pancreatic sulfonylurea receptor gene (SUR1 or ABCC8), glucokinase (GCK) gene, or hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (TCF1 or HNF1alpha) gene contribute to the inherited deficiencies of insulin secretion and beta-cell compensation to insulin resistance, as well as the secondary hypotheses that these variants altered insulin sensitivity.; We typed 124 nondiabetic members of 26 familial type 2 diabetic kindreds who had undergone tolbutamide-modified intravenous glucose tolerance tests for two variants of the ABCC8 (sulfonylurea) gene, two variants of the GCK gene, and one common amino acid variant in the TCF1 (HNF1alpha) gene. All family members were classified as normal or having impaired glucose tolerance based on oral glucose tolerance testing. We used minimal model analysis to calculate the insulin sensitivity index (S1) and glucose effectiveness (SG), and acute insulin response to glucose was calculated as the mean insulin excursion above baseline during the first 10 min after the glucose bolus. Disposition index (DI), a measure of beta-cell compensation for insulin sensitivity, was calculated as insulin sensitivity times acute insulin response. Effects of polymorphisms were determined using mixed effects models that incorporated family membership and by a likelihood analysis that accounted for family structure through polygenic inheritance.; An intronic variant of the ABCC8 gene just upstream of exon 16 was a significant determinant of both DI and an analogous index based on acute insulin response to tolbutamide. Surprisingly, heterozygous individuals showed the lowest indexes, whereas the DI in the two homozygous states did not differ significantly. Neither the exon 18 variant nor the variants in the GCK and TCF1 genes were significant in this model. However, combined genotypes of ABCC8 exon 16 and 18 variants again significantly predicted both indexes of glucose and tolbutamide-stimulated insulin secretion. Unexpectedly, a variant in the 3' untranslated region of the GCK gene interacted significantly with BMI to predict insulin sensitivity.; The exon 16 variant of the ABCC8 gene reduced beta-cell compensation to the decreased insulin sensitivity in the heterozygous state. This may explain the observation from several groups of an association of the ABCC8 variants in diabetes and is consistent with other studies showing a role of ABCC8 variants in pancreatic beta-cell function. However, our study focused on individuals from relatively few families. Ascertainment bias, family structure, and other interacting genes might have influenced our unexpected result. Additional studies are needed to replicate our observed deficit in beta-cell compensation in individuals heterozygous for ABCC8 variants. Likewise, the role of the GCK 3' variant in the reduced insulin sensitivity of obesity will require further study.",E,E

11336617,Clinical review of glimepiride.,"Clinical Trials as Topic; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Interactions; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Sulfonylurea Compounds","McCall, A L","This article reviews the pharmacological and clinical aspects of glimepiride, the latest second-generation sulfonylurea for treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Glimepiride therapy ameliorates the relative insulin secretory deficit found in most patients with Type 2 DM. It is a direct insulin secretagogue; indirectly, it also increases insulin secretion in response to fuels such as glucose. Its action to augment insulin secretion requires binding to a high affinity sulfonylurea receptor, which results in closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the beta-cells of the pancreas. The question has been raised whether insulin secretagogues by acting on vascular or myocardial potassium channels may prevent ischaemic preconditioning, a physiological adaptation that could affect the outcome of coronary heart disease, but there is evidence against this concern being applicable to glimepiride. Glimepiride's antihyperglycaemic efficacy is equal to other secretagogues. It has pharmacokinetic properties that make it less prone to cause hypoglycaemia in renal dysfunction than some other insulin secretagogues, particularly glyburide (also known as glibenclamide in Europe). Its convenient once daily dosing may enhance compliance for diabetic patients who often also require medications for other co-morbid conditions, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and cardiac disease. Glimepiride is approved for monotherapy, for combination with metformin and with insulin. Clinically, its reduced risk of hypoglycaemia makes it preferable to some other insulin secretagogues when attempting to achieve recommended glycaemic control (haemoglobin A(1c) (HgbA(1c)) 7%). Using suppertime neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) and regular insulin with morning glimepiride in overweight diabetic patients achieves glycaemic goals more quickly than insulin alone and with lower insulin doses.",E,E

The present study was undertaken to assess the effect of a new formulation of gliclazide administered once daily, gliclazide modified release, on plasma glucose levels over 24 hours.; In 21 type 2 diabetic patients previously treated by diet alone or oral antidiabetic agents, glycemic profile (8 am, 10 am, 12 am, 2 pm, 5 pm, 8 pm, 10 pm, 3 am and 8 am), overall glycemic control, acceptability, and compliance with treatment were assessed before and after a 10-week treatment with gliclazide modified release, (30-60 mg), given once daily at breakfast.; The results indicate a significant decrease in plasma glucose levels at all points of the cycle. Mean plasma glucose levels over 24 hours and mean plasma glucose levels during the fasting and the postprandial periods were significantly improved after treatment. In previous drug-naive patients, decrease in HbA1C was observed (1.0 +/- 1.1%, P=0.022). The acceptability was good, with no hypoglycemic events, and a high compliance with treatment was also observed.; We can therefore conclude that gliclazide modified release, given once daily at breakfast, is effective over 24 hours in reducing plasma glucose levels in type 2 diabetes.

Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide profiles during liquid meal challenges were measured at weeks 0 and 8. At weeks -1 and 7, 19-point daytime glucose and insulin profiles, comprising three solid meals, were measured.; During the liquid-meal challenge, nateglinide reduced the incremental glucose area under the curve (AUC) more effectively than glyburide ( = -4.94 vs. -2.71 mmol. h/l, P < 0.05), whereas glyburide reduced fasting plasma glucose more effectively than nateglinide ( = -2.9 vs. -1.0 mmol/l, respectively, P < 0.001). In contrast, C-peptide induced by glyburide was greater than that induced by nateglinide ( = +1.83 vs. +0.95 nmol. h/l, P < 0.01), and only glyburide increased fasting insulin levels. During the solid meal challenges, nateglinide and glyburide elicited similar overall glucose control ( 12-h incremental AUC = -13.2 vs. -15.3 mmol. h/l), but the insulin AUC induced by nateglinide was significantly less than that induced by glyburide ( 12-h AUC = +866 vs. +1,702 pmol. h/l, P = 0.01).; This study demonstrated that nateglinide selectively enhanced early insulin release and provided better mealtime glucose control with less total insulin exposure than glyburide.",I,I

This follow-up study was designed to determine the effect of the same Ginkgo biloba treatment on glucose-stimulated pancreatic beta-cell function in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) subjects. In diet-controlled subjects (fasting plasma glucose [FPG], 117 +/- 16 mg/dl; fasting plasma insulin [FPI], 29 +/- 8 microU/ml; n = 6), ingestion of Ginkgo biloba produced no significant effect on the insulin AUC0-->120 (193 +/- 53 vs. 182 +/- 58 microU/ml/h, before and after ingesting Ginkgo biloba, respectively). In hyperinsulinemic NIDDM subjects taking oral hypoglycemic medications (n = 6) (FPG 143 +/- 48 mg/dl; FPI 46 +/- 13 microU/ml), ingestion of Ginkgo biloba caused blunted plasma insulin levels from 30 to 120 minutes during the OGTT, leading to a reduction of the insulin AUC0-->120 (199 +/- 33 vs. 147 +/- 58 microU/ml/h, before and after Ginkgo biloba, respectively). The C-peptide levels increased, and so the AUC0-->120 did not parallel the insulin AUC0-->120, creating a dissimilar insulin/C-peptide ratio indicative of an enhanced hepatic extraction of insulin relative to C-peptide. Thus, in pancreatic beta-cells that are already maximally stimulated, ingestion of Ginkgo biloba may cause a reduction in plasma insulin levels. Only in NIDDM subjects with pancreatic exhaustion (FPG 152 +/- 46 mg/dl; FPI 16 +/- 8 microU/ml; n = 8), who also took oral hypoglycemic agents, did Ginkgo biloba ingestion significantly increase pancreatic beta-cell function in response to glucose loading (insulin AUC0-->120 increased from 51 +/- 29 to 98 +/- 20 microU/ml/h, p < 0.0001), paralleled by a C-peptide AUC0-->120 increase from 7.2 +/- 2.8 to 13.7 +/- 6.8 (p < 0.0001). Whether this increase is due to ""resuscitation"" of previously exhausted islets or increased activity of only the remaining functional islets is unclear. However, not even in this group did increased pancreatic beta-cell activity cause a reduction of blood glucose during the OGTT. It is concluded that ingestion of Ginkgo biloba extract by an NIDDM subject may increase the hepatic metabolic clearance rate of not only insulin but also the hypoglycemic agents. The result is reduced insulin-mediated glucose metabolism and elevated blood glucose.",E,E

Nateglinide is an oral hypoglycemic agent approved for use alone or in combination with metformin as an adjunct to diet and exercise for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nateglinide, an amino acid derivative of D-phenylalanine, stimulates the secretion of insulin by binding to the ATP potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells. The result is an increase in beta-cell calcium influx, which leads to rapid, short-lived insulin release. The drug is rapidly and completely absorbed in the small intestine. The estimated bioavailability is 72%. Nateglinide is highly bound to plasma proteins, is metabolized extensively by the liver, and has an elimination half-life of 1.4 hours. Several clinical trials of nateglinide, alone and in combination with other oral hypoglycemic agents, have found the drug to be safe, effective, and well tolerated. The most common adverse effects are nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and lightheadedness. There is a potential for interactions between nateglinide and medications affected by the cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme system. Dosage regimens ranging from 60 to 240 mg have been evaluated. The maximum effective dosage is 120 mg taken 10 minutes before meals three times a day. Nateglinide is an alternative to second-generation sulfonylureas for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additional comparative trials are needed to fully elucidate nateglinide's role.",I,I

However, in vivo results have been disputed because the amelioration of insulin action that follows sulfonylurea may represent the relief from glucose toxicity rather than a direct effect of the drug. Therefore, we studied the hypoglycemic action of gliclazide acutely and after 2 months of therapy in seven type 2 diabetic patients. All patients received a 240-minute i.v. glucose infusion with [3-3H]glucose. In a random order, 160 mg gliclazide (study 1) or placebo (study 2) was given orally before glucose infusion. Finally, the effect of 160 mg gliclazide was reassessed after a two-month treatment with the same sulfonylurea (80 mg t.i.d.). Basal plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and endogenous glucose production (EGP) were similar before the two initial studies. During glucose infusion, EGP was more suppressed after gliclazide in spite of comparable increase in plasma insulin and C-peptide. After the two-month therapy, basal plasma glucose levels and HbA1c were lower while plasma insulin and C-peptide were higher with respect to baseline (p < 0.05). Gliclazide further reduced plasma glucose, the incremental area above baseline, and EGP during glucose infusion, while plasma insulin and C-peptide achieved higher plateaus (p < 0.05). When data were pooled, plasma glucose concentration and EGP correlated both in the basal state (r = 0.71) and during the last hour of glucose infusion (r = 0.84; both p < 0.05). These data suggest that gliclazide enhances the suppression of EGP induced by insulin and that this effect is greater with chronic treatment because of concomitant improvement of insulin secretion.",E,E

Although sulfonylurea drugs are widely used for the treatment of this disease, their effect on insulin release patterns is not well established. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of acute treatment and 5 weeks of sulfonylurea (gliclazide) treatment on insulin secretory dynamics in type 2 diabetic patients. To this end, 10 patients with type 2 diabetes (age 53 +/- 2 years, BMI 27.5 +/- 1.1 kg/m(2), fasting plasma glucose 9.8 +/- 0.8 mmol/l, HbA(1c) 7.5 +/- 0.3%) were studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled prospective crossover design. Patients received 40-80 mg gliclazide/placebo twice daily for 5 weeks with a 6-week washout period intervening. Insulin pulsatility was assessed by 1-min interval blood sampling for 75 min 1) under baseline conditions (baseline), 2) 3 h after the first dose (80 mg) of gliclazide (acute) with the plasma glucose concentration clamped at the baseline value, 3) after 5 weeks of treatment (5 weeks), and 4) after 5 weeks of treatment with the plasma glucose concentration clamped during the sampling at the value of the baseline assessment (5 weeks-elevated). Serum insulin concentration time series were analyzed by deconvolution, approximate entropy (ApEn), and spectral and autocorrelation methods to quantitate pulsatility and regularity. The P values given are gliclazide versus placebo; results are means +/- SE. Fasting plasma glucose was reduced after gliclazide treatment (baseline vs. 5 weeks: gliclazide, 10.0 +/- 0.9 vs. 7.8 +/- 0.6 mmol/l; placebo, 10.0 +/- 0.8 vs. 11.0 +/- 0.9 mmol/l, P = 0.001). Insulin secretory burst mass was increased (baseline vs. acute: gliclazide, 43.0 +/- 12.0 vs. 61.0 +/- 17.0 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1); placebo, 36.1 +/- 8.4 vs. 30.3 +/- 7.4 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1), P = 0.047; 5 weeks-elevated: gliclazide vs. placebo, 49.7 +/- 13.3 vs. 37.1 +/- 9.5 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1), P < 0.05) with a similar rise in burst amplitude. Basal (i.e., nonoscillatory) insulin secretion also increased (baseline vs. acute: gliclazide, 8.5 +/- 2.2 vs. 16.7 +/- 4.3 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1); placebo, 5.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 7.2 +/- 0.9 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1), P = 0.03; 5 weeks-elevated: gliclazide vs. placebo, 12.2 +/- 2.5 vs. 9.4 +/- 2.1 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1), P = 0.016). The frequency and regularity of insulin pulses were not modified significantly by the antidiabetic therapy. There was, however, a correlation between individual values for the acute improvement of regularity, as measured by ApEn, and the decrease in fasting plasma glucose during short-term (5-week) gliclazide treatment (r = 0.74, P = 0.014, and r = 0.77, P = 0.009, for fine and coarse ApEn, respectively). In conclusion, the sulfonylurea agent gliclazide augments insulin secretion by concurrently increasing pulse mass and basal insulin secretion without changing secretory burst frequency or regularity. The data suggest a possible relationship between the improvement in short-term glycemic control and the acute improvement of regularity of the in vivo insulin release process.",I,I

Furthermore, in many people with diabetes the disease deteriorates, despite the use of blood-glucose lowering medication, due to the decline of the pancreatic beta cells. The development of new drugs, such as repaglinide, is therefore important. Repaglinide is an insulin secretion enhancer with a different mechanism of action to the sulphonylureas, which means it does not continuously stimulate insulin secretion. The tablets should be taken with each meal. After oral ingestion repaglinide is resorbed quickly, with a half-life of between 30 minutes to an hour. In clinical trials repaglinide has been found to be equally effective as glibenclamide. Repaglinide has been found to be particularly effective in sulphonylurea-na茂ve patients. Skipping the meal plus tablet combination results in less frequent hypoglycaemic symptoms compared to glibenclamide. Repaglinide results in greater reductions in postprandial glucose levels than glibenclamide. It does not affect insulin resistance. Long-term data are lacking, both with regard to efficacy and side effects. Repaglinide deserves a place in the diabetes treatment of newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients who are well-informed about their disease, as well as in patients with renal failure.

The accelerated macrovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus is due partly to the increased incidence of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia. Advanced glycation end products, glycoxidised and oxidized low-density lipoproteins and reactive oxygen species linked to hyperglycemia have all been identified in type 2 diabetes mellitus and could accelerate macroangiopathy. Hence, the resistance to insulin is an additional independent risk factor, in association with oxidant stress, dyslipidemias, and prothrombic/hypofibrinolytic states. The endothelium is a major organ involved by cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, inflammation, ageing, postmenopausal status, and smoking. Changes in endothelium function may lead to the coronary artery circulation being unable to cope with the increased metabolism of myocardial muscle independently of a reduced coronary artery diameter. The way endothelial function is altered in diabetic patients is not yet fully understood, but the loss of normal endothelial function could be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic angiopathy, as endothelial dysfunction is associated with diabetic microangiopathy and macroangiopathy. Finally, recent reports indicate that an improved metabolic control in diabetic patients, whatever the treatment used, is associated with near normalization or restoration of normal endothelial function.",E,E

It may have additional pharmacologic effects, however, as its main target is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. Data using the homeostasis model assessment and proinsulin:insulin ratio in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus suggest that rosiglitazone may have the potential to sustain or improve beta-cell function. In these patients the drug reduces fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, insulin, and C-peptide. In clinical trials, rosiglitazone monotherapy significantly reduced glycosylated hemoglobin by 1.5% compared with placebo and led to significant improvements in glycemic control when given in combination with metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulin. A dosage of 4 mg twice/day significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose levels and produced comparable reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin compared with glyburide. Rosiglitazone has a low risk of gastrointestinal side effects and hypoglycemia, reduced insulin demand, potential sparing effects on beta-cells, and favorable drug interaction profile. Adverse events of clinical significance are edema, anemia, and weight gain. Premarketing data indicate no significant difference in liver enzyme elevations for rosiglitazone, placebo, or active controls.

The effects of a meal on the oral bioavailability and pharmacodynamic actions of nateglinide were investigated. Twelve healthy male subjects completed this randomized, single-dose, four-way crossover study in which each subject received a 60 mg dose of nateglinide 10 minutes before the start of and immediately after a high-fat breakfast meal. In addition, each subject received a single 30 and 60 mg dose of nateglinide underfasting conditions. Plasma and urine concentrations of nateglinide were determined by an HPLC method while plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured by standard immunoassay methods. Compared to the fasted state, administration of nateglinide 10 minutes before the meal was associated with an increase in the rate of absorption (12% increase in Cmax and 52% decrease in tmax), while there was no significant effect on the extent of absorption (AUC). Alternatively, when nateglinide was given after the meal, a food effect was observed that was characterized by a decrease in the rate of absorption: 34% decrease in Cmax and a 22% increase in tmax but no significant effect on AUC. Nateglinide was rapidly eliminated with plasma t 1/2 = 1.4 hours. Its plasma renal clearance, 20.7 ml/min, appears to be due mostly to active tubular secretion. However, only 13% to 14% of the dose is recovered as nateglinide in the urine. The 30 and 60 mg tablets were dose proportional in terms of both AUC and Cmax; both tmax and t 1/2 were dose independent. Regardless of timing, the combination of a meal and nateglinide produced a larger increase in insulin levels than did nateglinide alone. Meal-related glucose excursions were eliminated when nateglinide was taken prior to the meal. Thus, the rapid onset/short duration stimulation of insulin release by nateglinide should allow good control of prandial hyperglycemia while limiting exposure to hyperinsulinemia.",I,I

Each respondent underwent a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. PCH was defined as a 2-h glucose level >or=200 mg/dl.; Overall, PCH was present in 74% of those with diagnosed diabetes. Although it was present in virtually all (99%) of the diabetic adults under suboptimal glycemic control (HbA(1c) >or=7.0%), PCH was also common (39%) among those under optimal control (HbA(1c) <7.0%). Likewise, among sulfonylurea users, PCH was present in 99% of those under suboptimal control and in 63% of those under good control. Similar patterns were observed in those with undiagnosed diabetes. Isolated PCH (2-h glucose >or=200 mg/dl and fasting glucose <126 mg/dl) was present in 9.8% of the adults with diagnosed diabetes.; These data suggest that PCH is common among diabetic adults in the U.S., even in the setting of ""optimal"" glycemic control and sulfonylurea use. Interventions designed to lower postprandial glucose excursions may help improve overall glycemic control in the general population of U.S. adults with diabetes.",E,E

Like the sulphonylureas, repaglinide reduces blood glucose by stimulating insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells, but differs from these and other antidiabetic agents in its structure, binding profile, duration of action and mode of excretion. In clinical trials of up to 1-year's duration, repaglinide maintained or improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In comparative, 1-year, double-blind, randomised trials (n = 256 to 544), patients receiving repaglinide (0.5 to 4mg before 3 daily meals) achieved similar glycaemic control to that in patients receiving glibenclamide (glyburide) < or = 15 mg/day and greater control than patients receiving glipizide < or = 15 mg/day. Changes from baseline in glycosylated haemoglobin and fasting blood glucose levels were similar between patients receiving repaglinide and glibenclamide in all studies; however, repaglinide was slightly better than glibenclamide in reducing postprandial blood glucose in I short term study (n = 192). Patients can vary their meal timetable with repaglinide: the glucose-lowering efficacy of repaglinide was similar for patients consuming 2, 3 or 4 meals a day. Repaglinide showed additive effects when used in combination with other oral antidiabetic agents including metformin, troglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, and intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) given at bedtime. In 1-year trials, the most common adverse events reported in repaglinide recipients (n = 1,228) were hypoglycaemia (16%), upper respiratory tract infection (10%), rhinitis (7%), bronchitis (6%) and headache (9%). The overall incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar to that recorded in patients receiving glibenclamide, glipizide or gliclazide (n = 597) [18%]; however, the incidence of serious hypoglycaemia appears to be slightly higher in sulphonylurea recipients. Unlike glibenclamide, the risk of hypoglycaemia in patients receiving repaglinide was not increased when a meal was missed in 1 trial. In conclusion, repaglinide is a useful addition to the other currently available treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Preprandial repaglinide has displayed antihyperglycaemic efficacy at least equal to that of various sulphonylureas and is associated with a reduced risk of serious hypoglycaemia. It is well tolerated in a wide range of patients, including the elderly, even if a meal is missed. Furthermore, glycaemic control is improved when repaglinide is used in combination with metformin. Thus, repaglinide should be considered for use in any patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood glucose cannot be controlled by diet or exercise alone, or as an adjunct in patients whose glucose levels are inadequately controlled on metformin alone.",I,I

Epidemiological studies have shown that post-prandial hyperglycaemia, rather than fasting hyperglycaemia, is more closely related to cardiovascular complications. It is, therefore, possible that previous studies may have overlooked the possible benefits of tight control of post-prandial hyperglycaemia as an important factor in reducing the cardiovascular mortality. Nateglinide is a novel D-phenylalanine derivative that inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ channels in pancreatic beta-cells in the presence of glucose and thereby restores first phase insulin response in patients with Type 2 diabetes. This helps in reducing post-prandial glucose excursion. Combination studies with metformin have shown it to be effective in controlling hyperglycaemia. While metformin reduces the basal plasma glucose, nateglinide helps in controlling post-prandial peaks. Nateglinide provides a new therapeutic option for treating Type 2 diabetes by specifically targeting post-prandial hyperglycaemia.",I,I

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of acute glibenclamide administration on postprandial lipaemia in Type 2 diabetic patients.; Eight randomly selected Type 2 diabetic individuals, aged 43-65 years (mean, 54 years), who had never received any anti-diabetic drug, were included in the study. Each patient was given a 485 kcal mixed meal (45% fat, 40% carbohydrate and 15% protein) twice on separate days after an overnight fast: once with placebo and once with 5 mg glibenclamide, per os, in a random order. The two tests were performed with an interval of 7 days. Venous blood samples were drawn just before and 2 h, 4 h and 6 h after meal consumption. Total triglyceride levels in plasma, in chylomicrons (CM), in CM-deficient plasma, in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) subfractions (VLDL-1, VLDL-2) and in intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) were determined. Free fatty acid (FFA) and total cholesterol levels in plasma, as well as high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in CM-deficient plasma, were also measured. Finally, serum glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentrations were measured in each sample.; As expected there was a significant decrease in postprandial glycaemia after glibenclamide administration compared to placebo (mean area under the curve values: AUC = 53.3 +/- 18.2 and 69.1 +/- 21.6 mm/h, P = 0.00009). In addition, the mean AUC values of insulin and C-peptide were significantly greater after drug administration. The AUC values of total plasma triglyceride and of CM triglyceride following glibenclamide administration were significantly lower compared to placebo, while the AUC values of postprandial triglyceride in CM-deficient plasma and of postprandial triglyceride in VLDL-1, VLDL-2 and IDL were not different after drug administration compared to placebo. Finally, no significant differences were noted in the AUC values of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and plasma FFA levels after glibenclamide administration.; These results demonstrate that glibenclamide administration improves postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia acutely by reducing postprandial triglycerides of intestinal origin.",I,I

It is now possible to identify subjects at high risk of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, especially in the patient's family members. Preventive interventions are quickly becoming available, and can help delay the onset of the disease and thereby reduce complications in these subjects. Furthermore the correct etiological diagnosis of diabetes is fundamental in providing the best treatment for the patient. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) syndrome should be suspected in cases of a subtle onset of diabetes and autosomal dominant inheritance. Mitochondrial DNA mutations should be considered when a diabetic patient also suffers from deafness or if there is a family history of this combination in the mother side of the family. Atypical diabetes has to be identified by the physician to avoid mistakes when the patient enters the non-insulin-dependent phase. In the case of Wolfram's syndrome a gene analysis for each family member should be performed to identify heterozygote subjects. Recently, many discoveries in genetics help us better understand the pathogenesis of the diseases and diagnose the monogenic form of diabetes more easily. If all family members are followed in the same center, clues from the family history are readily available for differential diagnosis and preventive interventions can be established more effectively.",E,E

Because a normal pattern of insulin secretion is essential for the effective control of postprandial metabolism, a rational basis for the development of agents that target early-phase insulin release exists. Conventional oral hypoglycaemic agents do not target, or adequately control, postprandial glycaemia. The emergence of new classes of oral agent with a more specific mode of action provides, for the first time, an opportunity to restore early-phase insulin release. One such drug class is the meglitinide analogues (repaglinide, nateglinide, and mitiglinide). These drugs are ideally suited for combination use with metformin. They could also prove effective in combination with a thiazolidinedione, a drug class that targets insulin resistance. Exogenous insulin is frequently required in the late management of type 2 diabetes. However, one hope for newer combinations of diabetic drugs is that the functional life of the beta cell can be extended, thereby delaying the need for insulin injections.",I,I

Thiazolidinediones, more commonly termed glitazones, are the first drugs to specifically target muscular insulin resistance. They have proven efficacy for reducing plasma glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with diet alone, sulphonylureas, metformin or insulin. In addition, they are associated with some improvement of the cardiovascular risk profile. However, troglitazone, the first compound approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US, proved to be hepatotoxic and was withdrawn from the market after the report of several dozen deaths or cases of severe hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation. It remains unclear whether or not hepatotoxicity is a class effect or is related to unique properties of troglitazone. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, two other glitazones, appear to have similar efficacy with regard to blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as compared with troglitazone. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of significant (> or =3 x upper limit of normal) increases in liver enzyme levels (ALT in particular) was similar with rosiglitazone or pioglitazone as compared with placebo, whereas troglitazone was associated with a 3-fold greater incidence. In contrast to the numerous case reports of acute liver failure in patients receiving troglitzone, only a few case reports of hepatotoxicity have been reported in patients treated with rosiglitazone until now, with a causal relationship remaining uncertain. Furthermore, no single case of severe hepatotoxicity has been reported yet with pioglitazone. It should be mentioned that troglitazone, unlike pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, induces the cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4, which is partly responsible for its metabolism, and may be prone to drug interactions. Importantly enough, obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus are associated with liver abnormalities, especially non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, independent of any pharmacological treatment. This association obviously complicates the selection of patients who are good candidates for a treatment with glitazones as well as the monitoring of liver tests after initiation of therapy with any thiazolidinedione compound. While regular monitoring of liver enzymes is still recommended and more long term data are desirable, current evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing experience in the US supports the conclusion that rosiglitazone and pioglitazone do not share the hepatotoxic profile of troglitazone.",E,E

Deciphering which agent to use in certain clinical situations is a new dilemma facing the primary care physician.; To systematically review available data from the literature regarding the efficacy of oral antidiabetic agents, both as monotherapy and in combination.; A MEDLINE search was performed to identify all English-language reports of unique, randomized controlled clinical trials involving recently available oral agents for type 2 diabetes. Bibliographies were also reviewed to find additional reports not otherwise identified.; Studies (63) were included in the analysis if they had a study period of at least 3 months; if each group contained at least 10 subjects at the study's conclusion; and if hemoglobin A(1c) was reported. When multiple dosages of a drug were tested, the results of the highest approved dosage were used. In placebo-controlled trials, hemoglobin A(1c) data are presented as the difference between the change in treated vs placebo subjects.; Five distinct oral drug classes are now available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Compared with placebo treatment, most of these agents lower hemoglobin A(1c) levels approximately 1% to 2%. Equivalent efficacy is usually demonstrated when different agents are compared with one another in the same study population. When they are used in combination, there are additional glycemic benefits. Long-term vascular risk reduction has been demonstrated only with sulfonylureas and metformin.; With few exceptions, the available oral antidiabetic agents are equally effective at lowering glucose concentrations. Their mechanisms of action are different, however, and as a result they appear to have distinct metabolic effects. These are reflected in their adverse effect profiles and their effect on cardiovascular risk, which may influence drug choice.",E,E

All patients started glimepiride 1 mg once daily and escalated to 2, 3, 4 and until 6 mg every 4 weeks if fasting plasma glucose (FPG) exceeded 140 mg/dL. Subjects were 60 females and 29 males with an average age of 52.2 +/- 10.0 years. Mean BMI was 25.5 +/- 3.8 kg/m2. Fifty seven patients (64.0%) were drug na茂ve and thirty two patients (36.0%) had been previously treated with oral hypoglycemic agents. Seventy three per cent of the drug na茂ve and 37 per cent of the previously treated patients could be controlled with 1-2 mg of glimepiride once daily.

Significant reductions were also recorded in fasting blood glucose and HbA(1c) levels. The repaglinide regimen, in which a dose was taken before each main meal, was more effective in improving glycemic control (including postprandial glucose and HbA(1c) levels) than the same total dose of repaglinide divided into morning and evening mealtime doses.; These data support the strategy of mealtime dosing with repaglinide. The improvements in glycemic control observed in these patients are encouraging. In addition to classic parameters of glycemic control, improvements in postprandial glucose excursions may prove to be important because postprandial hyperglycemia has been suggested to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in diabetes.",I,I

This article provides a short review of the pharmacology and some clinical aspects of various oral antidiabetic drugs. It focuses mainly on the newest developing drugs (therapy of the near future) and on the most commonly used older groups for the common approach of every-day practice (sulphonylureas). The primary goal of this review is to compare the electrophysiological effects of glibenclamide in isolated normal and streptozotocin induced diabetic rats and alloxan induced rabbits ventricular preparations, while on the other hand to differentiate the hypoglycaemic sulphonylureas (0.1-1000 mmol/kg) according to their cardiovascular activity in healthy and diabetic animals. In vitro (1-100 micromol/l) as well as chronically treated (5 mg/kg for 10 weeks) glibenclamide prolonged the action potential duration in normal but failed to affect it in diabetic ventricular preparations. Our results suggest that the sensitivity to glibenclamide of K(ATP) channels in diabetic ventricular fibers is drastically decreased. The effects of different sulphonylureas (tolbutamide, glibenclamide, gliclazide, glimepiride) on ventricular ectopic beats as well as the duration of ventricular fibrillation induced by 10 min ischemia/50 min reperfusion in healthy and diabetic rats were compared. Tolbutamide and gliclazide dose-dependently enhanced both parameters both in healthy and diabetic groups. Glibenclamide in healthy rats increased, while in diabetic rats it decreased the arrhythmogenicity. Glimepiride depressed the arrhythmogenicity in both healthy and diabetic animals. Glimepiride proved to dose-dependently enhance the myocardial tissue flow in dog in contrast to glibenclamide. These results confirm that glimepiride has less cardiovascular actions than other sulphonylureas. From the newest oral antidiabetics this review tries to emphasize the most important basic pharmacological properties, mechanism of action, therapeutic use.",E,E

This effect may imply harmful cardiovascular effects of glibenclamide when used under conditions of ischaemia in patients with Type II diabetes. Acarbose is not associated with effects on the cardiovascular system, because the drug is not absorbed from the bowel. Therefore we hypothesized that treatment of Type II diabetes patients with glibenclamide will impair the vasodilator function of K(ATP) opening, unlike treatment with acarbose. A double-blind randomized cross-over study in 12 patients with Type II diabetes was performed to compare the effects of glibenclamide with those of acarbose on the vasodilator responses to K(ATP) channel opening in the forearm vascular bed. The study consisted of two periods: 8 weeks of treatment with orally administered glibenclamide (10 mg x day(-1)) followed by 8 weeks of treatment with acarbose (300 mg x day(-1)), or vice versa. At the end of each treatment period, forearm blood flow (venous occlusion plethysmography) in response to intra-arterially administered diazoxide, acetylcholine and dipyridamole and to forearm ischaemia was measured. The diazoxide-mediated increase in the forearm blood flow ratio (infused/control arm) was significantly less pronounced after glibenclamide than after acarbose (290 +/- 58% and 561 +/- 101% respectively; P<0.0005). Forearm blood flow responses to acetylcholine, dipyridamole and forearm ischaemia were similar during glibenclamide and acarbose treatment. Thus, in patients with Type II diabetes mellitus, treatment with glibenclamide is associated with an attenuated response to K(ATP) opening as compared with treatment with acarbose. This implies that glibenclamide may affect defensive mechanisms under conditions of K(ATP) channel activation.",E,E

Treatment was crossed over after 12 weeks and maintained for another 12 weeks. At the end of each treatment, left ventricular myocardial function at rest and during dipyridamole infusion was studied by two-dimensional echocardiography under the same conditions of metabolic control. Glibenclamide or insulin treatment did not influence the rest values of left ventricular dimensions, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), or wall motion score index (WMSI). Dipyridamole infusion, in patients receiving glibenclamide treatment, decreased LVEF (43 +/- 7 vs. 37 +/- 12%, P < 0.005) and increased WMSI (1.4 +/- 0.28 vs. 1.98 +/- 0.24, P < 0.001) compared with baseline values; during insulin treatment, LVEF (46 +/- 8 vs. 45 +/- 11%, NS) and WMSI (1.4 +/- 0.29 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.4, NS) did not change significantly.

Based on these data, we hypothesized that, in contrast to glibenclamide, chronic treatment of Type 2 diabetic patients with glimepiride or metformin will not impair the vasodilator function of K(ATP) opening in vivo.; Two groups of 12 Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients participated in a double-blind randomized cross-over study consisting of two 8-week periods, in which treatment with orally administered glibenclamide (15 mg/day) was compared with either glimepiride or metformin (6 mg and 1500 mg/day, respectively). At the end of each treatment period, the increase in forearm blood flow (FBF, venous occlusion plethysmography) in response to intra-arterial administered diazoxide (K(ATP) opener), acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent vasodilator) and dipyridamole (adenosine-uptake blocker) and to forearm ischaemia was measured.; There were no significant differences in vasodilator responses to diazoxide, acetylcholine, dipyridamole and forearm ischaemia after glibenclamide compared with glimepiride and metformin.; Chronic treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus with glimepiride or metformin has similar effects on vascular K(ATP) channels compared with chronic glibenclamide treatment.",E,E

In 1987, the islet amyloid precursor polypeptide (IAPP) amylin (a 37 amino acid) was discovered. Recently there has been an explosion of amylin's importance in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This review is intended to share what is understood about amylin derived amyloid and the role it plays in T2DM. Whether islet amyloid is an epiphenomenona, a tombstone, or a trigger it leaves an indelible footprint in greater that 70% of the patients with T2DM. There is current data supporting the damaging role of intermediate sized toxic amyloid particles to the beta cell resulting in a beta cell defect which contributes to a relative deficiency or loss of insulin secretion. Within the islet there is an intense redox stress which may be associated with the unfolding of amylin's native secondary structure compounding its amyloidogenic properties. In addition to the beta cell defect there may be an absorptive defect as a result of amyloid deposition in the basement membranes which form an envelope around the inta-islet capillary endothelium. We have an opportunity to change our current treatment modalities with newer medications and we should attempt to diagnose T2DM earlier and use these newer treatment strategies in combination to decrease glucotoxicity without elevating endogenous insulin and amylin. In the 21st century our goal should be to prevent remodeling, save the pancreatic islet, conquer islet amyloid, and amyloid diabetes.",5,E

Exercise, diet, and weight control continue to be essential and effective means of improving glucose homeostasis. However, lifestyle management measures may be insufficient or patient compliance difficult, rendering conventional drug therapies (i.e., oral glucose-lowering agents and insulin injection) necessary in many patients. In addition to adverse effects, drug treatments are not always satisfactory in maintaining euglycemia and avoiding late stage diabetic complications. As an alternative approach, medicinal herbs with antihyperglycemic activities are increasingly sought by diabetic patients and health care professionals.

Blood samples were taken immediately before and 90 min after regular Gb intake. A standardized breakfast was served 30 min after drug intake. Serum insulin and proinsulin levels were determined by ELISA methods without cross-reactivities. Serum drug levels were determined by HPLC. Fischer's R to Z-test (correlation coefficients) and paired Student t-tests were used when comparing values within the entire group and unpaired non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests were used when comparing high and low dose levels. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.; There were significant correlations between daily Gb dose, on the one hand, and, on the other, HbAlc (r = 0.55), Delta-insulin (r = - 0.59) and Delta-proinsulin (r = - 0.52) levels. Significant correlations between Gb therapy duration and insulin (r = - 0.40) and proinsulin (r = - 0.34) secretion and between Gb dose and ratio proinsulin/insulin (RPI) at both time points (r = 0.32 and 0.30) were also found. The RPI was lower after Gb intake. In patients on > or = 10.5 mg steady state serum metabolite levels (Ml and Ml + M2) were higher (29(0-120) and 33 (0-120) ng/ml) than those of Gb itself (18(0-64) ng/ml). A great inter-subject variability in Gb levels at both time points was seen.; Our results indicate that, in patients on chronic medication, Gb is capable of stimulating both insulin and proinsulin secretion; the effect on insulin release is relatively greater. The effect was more pronounced in patients on a low Gb dose, either because of less impaired beta-cells in those receiving low doses, or due to reduced sulphonylurea sensitivity in those on high dosage (down-regulation). In patients on a daily dose of 10.5 mg or more, serum metabolite levels of clinical relevance were demonstrated; the metabolites may contribute to hypoglycaemic events.",E,E

This pilot study was conducted to find the optimum dose of glimepiride in NANSY.; In a double blind trial in primary care 25 IFG subjects were in random order exposed to single doses and one-week treatments with 0 (placebo), 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg glimepiride once daily. The optimum dose was assessed by measuring blood glucose during oral 75 g glucose tolerance test (OGTT), comparing fasting blood glucose, and the area under the blood glucose curve (AUC), and by monitoring hypoglycaemic events.; With single doses, there was a clear dose-response relationship for the reduction in AUC, with a statistically significant difference only between placebo (mean 1981, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1883-2078) and 2 mg glimepiride (mean 1763, 95% CI 1665-1861).

Correspondingly, the only statistically significant difference in fasting blood glucose day 7 was between placebo (5.87 mmol/l, 95% CI 5.68-6.05 mmol/l) and 1 mg glimepiride (5.42 mmol/l, 95% CI 5.21-5.62 mmol/l). Chemical hypoglycaemia was common but hypoglycaemic symptoms were rare and similar between the active doses, and easily countered by the subjects.; The sulphonylurea dose-effect curve may be bell-shaped, perhaps due to down regulation of sulphonylurea receptors during chronic exposure. Alternatively, the finding could be a rebound phenomenon, secondary to preceding hypoglycaemia. The optimum dose for NANSY was found to be 1 mg glimepiride.",E,E

The patients were treated for 3 months with diet alone (30 kcal/kg per day) (n = 15), diet with voglibose (n = 12), or diet with glyburide (n = 9). They underwent 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing, assessment of insulin sensitivity (SI), and acute insulin response (AIR) with intravenous glucose tolerance testing based on the minimal model, and measurement of abdominal visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue area (SAT) by computed tomography before and after treatment.; The diabetic patients had comparable SAT but larger VAT than the control subjects. With a mean weight loss of 2-3 kg, VAT and SAT were decreased similarly in all treatment groups. The VAT-to-SAT ratio was decreased only in the voglibose group. Glycemic control and serum lipid profiles were improved in all groups. Changes in glycemic control after diet were closely correlated with changes in VAT but not with changes in SAT. SI and AIR were unchanged in the diet group but were improved in the voglibose and glyburide groups.; In Japanese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who were relatively lean but had excess VAT, diet with or without voglibose or glyburide effectively reduced VAT. Decrease in VAT was closely associated with improvement of glycemic control with diet. Additional use of voglibose or low-dose glyburide had no detrimental effects on abdominal adiposity and had beneficial effects on SI and AIR.",E,E

More than 90% of the estimated 200 million affected persons with diabetes worldwide have type 2 DM, an often clinically silent disorder. In the United States, nearly half of the estimated 16 million persons with diabetes remain undiagnosed. Type 2 diabetes is preceded by a long period of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), a potentially reversible metabolic state associated with increased risk for macrovascular complications. At the time of diagnosis more than one-third of patients have already developed long-term complications of diabetes. Genetic and acquired factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The pathophysiological hallmarks consist of progressive insulin resistance, pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, and excessive hepatic glucose production. The ideal treatment for type 2 diabetes should correct insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, and normalize hepatic glucose output, as well as prevent, delay, or reverse diabetic complications. Emerging targets for therapy of type 2 diabetes include inhibition of gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and fatty acid oxidation, as well as stimulation of beta3-adrenergic receptors. Drug intervention for obesity is a legitimate adjunct to diabetes management. Additional drug targets include interventions to prevent or delay the progression of specific complications. Finally, primary prevention of type 2 diabetes is an important emerging strategy. The specific pharmacological agents acting at the various targets are discussed in this review. A targeted approach to the multiple underlying pathophysiologic processes offers the best chance of controlling diabetes and complications.",E,E

Changes in fasting plasma glucose, lipids and body weight were also assessed along with 2-h postprandial glucose and insulin values after a standardized meal.; At week 20, patients taking glyburide/metformin 1.25/250 mg or 2.5/500 mg tablets had greater reductions in HbA1c levels (-1.48% and -1.53% respectively) compared with placebo (-0.21%; both p < 0.001), glyburide (-1.24%; p = 0.016 and p = 0.004 respectively) or metformin (-1.03%; both p < 0.001). Fasting plasma glucose concentrations were reduced more in both glyburide/metformin groups compared with placebo and metformin (p < 0.001); patients in both combination therapy groups also had significantly lower postprandial glucose concentrations compared with placebo, glyburide and metformin.; Initial combination treatment with glyburide/metformin tablets produces greater improvements in glycaemic control than either glyburide or metformin monotherapy. The superiority of initial therapy with glyburide/metformin tablets may arise from simultaneous treatment of both pathophysiological defects of type 2 diabetes.",E,E

Per study protocol, the insulin dose was to remain unchanged, but could be decreased in response to hypoglycaemia. At the end of double-blind treatment, patients receiving pioglitazone (15 mg or 30 mg) showed statistically significant mean decreases relative to baseline HbA1c (-1.0 and -1.3, respectively; p<0.0001) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (-34.5 mg/dl [-1.92 mmol/l] and -48.0 mg/dl [-2.67 mmol/l], respectively; p<0.0001); these differences compared with placebo were also significant (p<0.0001). Pioglitazone (15 or 30 mg) yielded significant increases in HDL-C levels (mean increases ranging from +7.1% to + 9.3%) compared with baseline or placebo (p<0.01). The 30 mg dose also significantly reduced mean triglyceride levels (-23.7%) compared with placebo (p=0.0218). No consistent changes in TC or LDL-C levels were observed. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all treatment groups, although the incidences of weight increase, hypoglycaemia and oedema were higher among patients receiving insulin plus pioglitazone. There was no evidence of hepatotoxicity or drug-induced elevations of serum ALT > or = 3 x ULN. Pioglitazone, when added to stable insulin regimens, significantly improved HbA1c and FPG in type 2 diabetes.

12076188,Gliclazide modified release.,"Animals; Biological Availability; Delayed-Action Preparations; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Gliclazide; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","McGavin, Jane K; Perry, Caroline M; Goa, Karen L","Gliclazide modified release (MR) is a new formulation of the drug gliclazide and is given once daily. The hydrophilic matrix of hypromellose-based polymer in the new formulation effects a progressive release of the drug which parallels the 24-hour glycaemic profile in untreated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The formulation shows high bioavailability and its absorption profile is unaffected by coadministration with food. Mean plasma glucose levels are significantly reduced over a 24-hour period in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with gliclazide MR once daily, in both fasting and postprandial states. No cardiovascular ATP-sensitive potassium channel interaction has been observed at therapeutic concentrations of gliclazide MR. Gliclazide MR has also demonstrated antioxidant properties that are independent of glycaemic control. In a randomised, double-blind, multicentre study, gliclazide MR 30 to 120 mg once daily showed similar efficacy to gliclazide immediate release (IR) 80 to 320 mg/day (in divided doses for doses >80 mg) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus over a 10-month period, reducing glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) to a similar extent. The drug appeared most efficacious in patients who had previously been treated by diet alone, where significant reductions in HbA(1c) from baseline of 0.9% and 0.95% were seen at 10 and 24 months. Similarly, a sustained effect of gliclazide MR was observed in a subgroup of elderly patients defined a priori; HbA(1c) was decreased to a similar degree to that observed in the general study population. Gliclazide MR showed similar tolerability to gliclazide IR after 10 months' treatment in the randomised trial. The most commonly observed adverse events were arthralgia, arthritis, back pain and bronchitis (each <5%). Bodyweight remained stable. In this study no episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemia requiring third party assistance were observed during treatment with gliclazide MR. Episodes of symptomatic hypoglycaemia were infrequent, occurring in approximately 5% of patients.",I,I

Although repaglinide binds to the sulphonylurea binding sites on pancreatic beta-cells and has a similar mechanism of action, repaglinide exhibits distinct pharmacological properties compared with these agents. Following administration, repaglinide is absorbed rapidly and has a fast onset of dose-dependent blood-glucose lowering effect. The drug is eliminated rapidly via the biliary route, without accumulation in the plasma after multiple doses. Repaglinide is well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes, including elderly patients and patients with hepatic or renal impairment. The pharmacokinetic profile of repaglinide and the improvements in post-prandial hyperglycaemia and overall glycaemic control make repaglinide suitable for administration preprandially, with the opportunity for flexible meal arrangements, including skipped meals, without the risk of hypoglycaemia.",E,E

12093468,Desensitization of insulin secretion.,"Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Glucose; Humans; Insulin; Sulfonylurea Compounds","Rustenbeck, Ingo","Desensitization of insulin secretion describes a reversible state of decreased secretory responsiveness of the pancreatic beta-cell, induced by a prolonged exposure to a multitude of stimuli. These include the main physiological stimulator, glucose, but also other nutrients like free fatty acids and practically all pharmacological stimulators acting by depolarization and Ca2+ influx into the beta-cell. Desensitization of insulin secretion appears to be an important step in the manifestation of type 2 diabetes and in the secondary failure of oral antidiabetic treatment. In this commentary, the basic concepts and the controversial issues in the field will be outlined. With regard to glucose-induced desensitization, two fundamentally opposing concepts have emerged. The first is that desensitization is the consequence of functional changes in the beta-cell that impair glucose-recognition. The second is that long-term increased secretory activity leads to a depletion of releasable insulin, often in spite of increased insulin synthesis. The latter concept is more appropriately termed beta-cell exhaustion. The same dichotomy applies to the desensitization evoked by pharmacological stimuli: again the relative contributions of a decreased insulin content versus alterations in signal transduction are in dispute. The action of tolbutamide on beta-cells may be an example of desensitization caused by a lack of releasable insulin since the signaling mechanisms are nearly unchanged, whereas the action of phentolamine, an imidazoline, induces a strong desensitization without reducing insulin content or secretory granules, apparently by abolishing Ca2+ influx. With pharmacological agents it seems that both, alterations in signal transduction and decreased availability of releasable insulin, can contribute to the desensitized state of the beta-cell, the relative contribution being variable depending upon the exact nature of the secretory stimulus.",E,E

Insulin sensitivity, pancreatic beta-cell function and surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk factors are significantly improved by rosiglitazone. Double-blind trials of 8 to 26 weeks of rosiglitazone 4 or 8 mg/day monotherapy indicate significant decreases in fasting plasma glucose (-2 to -3 mmol/L with 8 mg/day) and glycosylated haemoglobin levels [HbA(1c); -0.6 to -0.7% (-0.8 to -1.1% in drug-naive patients) with 8 mg/day]. Significant decreases in hyperglycaemic markers occurred when rosiglitazone was combined with metformin (HbA(1c) -0.8 to -1.0%), a sulphonylurea (-1.4%) or insulin (-1.2%) for 26 weeks versus little change with active comparator monotherapy. Efficacy was maintained in trials of < or = 2 years, and was also apparent in various ethnic subgroups, elderly patients, and both obese and nonobese patients. Rosiglitazone is currently not indicated in combination with injected insulin. It should be administered in conjunction with diet and exercise regimens. Rosiglitazone is generally well tolerated. Despite rare individual reports of liver function abnormalities in rosiglitazone recipients, the incidence of these in clinical trials (< or = 2 years' duration) was similar to that in placebo and active comparator groups. Fluid retention associated with rosiglitazone may be the cause of the increased incidence of anaemia in clinical trials, and also means that patients should be monitored for signs of heart failure during therapy. Although bodyweight is increased overall with rosiglitazone therapy, increases are in subcutaneous, not visceral, fat; hepatic fat is decreased. The pharmacokinetic profile of rosiglitazone is not substantially altered by age or renal impairment, nor are there important drug interactions. Rosiglitazone is not indicated in patients with active liver disease or increased liver enzymes.; Oral rosiglitazone 4 or 8 mg/day provides significant antihyperglycaemic efficacy and is generally well tolerated, both as monotherapy and in combination with other antihyperglycaemic agents, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who do not have active liver disease. Long-term data are required before conclusions can be drawn about the clinical significance of positive changes to surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease risk and improvements to pancreatic beta-cell function. Rosiglitazone significantly improves insulin sensitivity and, as such, is a welcome addition to the treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",E,E

During the last decade there was an increased interest in the use of oral antihyperglycemic agents (OAHAs) as an alternative to insulin in achieving good glycemic control. OAHAs are divided into four groups: derivatives of sulfonylurea, biguanides, glucosidase inhibitors and thiazolidinediones. This review describes the possible teratogenic effects of the use of OAHAs during pregnancy and the effects of these drugs during lactation. Animal and human studies assessing the teratogenic effects of OAHAs have yielded conflicting data because the risk of major malformations in infants of mothers with diabetes appears to be related to maternal glycemic control rather than the antidiabetic therapy. A major concern with the use of OAHAs during pregnancy is neonatal hypoglycemia, which may be severe and persist for days. Therefore, insulin is still the drug of choice because it has not been implicated as a teratogen in human pregnancies. In addition, because of the lack of data regarding the use of OAHAs in pregnancy, we cannot draw firm conclusions about all of the available drugs. However, OAHAs, especially glibenclamide (glyburide), may be beneficial in a situation where the proper use of insulin is problematic. Because there are very limited clinical data on the exposure of OAHAs to the infant via breast milk, and the potentially serious effect of neonatal hypoglycemia, the safest recommendation is not to breast feed while taking OAHAs. Well-conducted, prospective, controlled studies regarding the feasibility of OAHAs in pregnant women with diabetes and during lactation are needed.",E,E

The first of the thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizing agents, troglitazone was quickly followed by rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. The glitazones proved to be effective not only in lowering blood glucose, but also to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk. Troglitazone was subsequently withdrawn because of concerns about hepatotoxicity, which appears to be less of a problem with rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. Recent insights into the molecular mechanism of action of the glitazones, which are ligands for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, open the prospect of designing more effective, selective and safer antidiabetic agents.

It has been reported to result in prolongation of the QT interval. QT interval dispersion (QTd) is a potentially sensitive marker for increased risk of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of glyburide on QTd and compare it with that of metformin, a hypoglycemic agent that does not block the adenosine triphosphate sensitive K+ channel. Thirty patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to glyburide and metformin groups. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained before and at 2 months after being on glyburide or metformin. Therapy with QT and QTd were measured and QT corrected for rate (QTc). There was no significant difference between the glyburide and metformin groups in age (62 +/- 9 vs 59 +/- 10 years), baseline RR interval (819 +/- 86 vs 753 +/- 100 ms), QT (387 +/- 28 vs 383 +/- 27 ms), and QTc (433 +/- 25 vs 444 +/- 15 ms).

Currently the United States spends approximately $100 billion in healthcare costs annually for the management of diabetes. Most of the costs are attributed to hospitalizations and treatment of diabetes complications. Preventing these complications with tight glycemic control is the key to reducing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs secondary to diabetes mellitus. Recently, the American College of Endocrinology also stressed earlier screening for diabetes and endorsed lowering the goal percent of hemoglobin glycosylation to 6.5%. These strategies help identify patients with diabetes at an earlier stage and in turn prevent more complications. Better control of diabetes is now feasible with the recent approval of 8 new antidiabetic products. Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are agents with a novel mechanism of action. Metformin XR, insulin aspart, and miglitol are agents that are similar to previously marketed products, but have different pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties. Metformin/glyburide is the first combination product for the treatment of diabetes. Nateglinide represents the first agent in a new class of antidiabetic agents and insulin glargine is a novel insulin preparation.

Women with GD often have impaired pancreatic beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance. The nature of GD is currently contentious, with debate about its existence, diagnosis and ramifications for both mother and offspring from pregnancy into later life. Also contentious are the outcomes of intervention with diet, insulin, glyburide (Glynase trade mark, Pharmacia Upjohn) and metformin (Glucophage trade mark, Bristol-Myers Squibb). There is consensus that women with unequivocal GD have a significant risk of adverse perinatal outcomes and increased risk of later type 2 diabetes mellitus. Foetuses from pregnancies with GD have a higher risk of macrosomia (associated with higher rate of birth injuries), asphyxia, and neonatal hypoglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia. Uncontrolled GD predisposes foetuses to accelerated, excessive fat accumulation, insulin resistance, pancreatic exhaustion secondary to prenatal hyperglycaemia and possible higher risk of child and adult obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus later in adult life. However, there is no consensus as to whether glucose intolerance of a severity below unequivocal GD is related to adverse maternal, fetal or perinatal outcomes, and whether this relationship is a continuous one. If dietary intervention is not sufficient in the treatment of GD, then, historically, insulin has been added. Recent studies suggest that glyburide may be efficaciously substituted for insulin. Preliminary studies suggest that metformin may have the unique potential to prevent the development of GD.",E,E

Their age was 62 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) years (range 44-79 years), body weight 71.3 +/- 2.9 kg, body mass index (BMI) 24.6 +/- 0.8 kg/m(2). The patients were switched to insulin treatment with bedtime NPH insulin combined with daytime sulphonylurea (combination group) or twice daily injections of a premixed combination of regular human and NPH insulin (insulin twice daily group) with measurements as given below before and after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment.; HbA(1c) was lowered from 8.3 +/- 0.3% to 7.0 +/- 0.2% in the insulin twice daily group (p<0.05) and from 8.3 +/- 0.3% to 6.8 +/- 0.5% in the combination group (p<0.03; ns between treatment groups). Body weight increased from 71.7 +/- 4.0 kg to 77.6 +/- 4.4 kg in the insulin twice daily group (p<0.001) and from 70.8 +/- 4.6 kg to 72.7 +/- 5.1 kg in the combination group (ns; p<0.02 between groups). The dose of insulin at 24 weeks in the insulin twice daily group was 45.8 +/- 4.2 U and 29.4 +/- 5.4 U in the combination group (p=0.03). Combination treatment reduced fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels.; Both treatments improved glycaemic control to the same extent but the combination of bedtime NPH insulin and daytime sulphonylurea gave a very small increase of body weight over a 6 months period. We conclude that combination therapy is an attractive alternative when starting insulin treatment in patients with Type 2 diabetes as this is a critical period for weight gain in such patients.",E,E

After a 2-week washout, patients were crossed over to the other treatment for 14 days. Patients consumed standardised meals on the days when pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations were performed.; Forty patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled; 37 were randomised (18 men, 19 women) and 35 completed the study. Mean age was 58 years; mean body mass index was 31 kg/m(2). The baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) was 9.3% for both treatment groups.; Two-hour postprandial glucose excursion (PPGE) was used to assess postprandial glucose dynamics.; Treatment with glibenclamide/metformin resulted in a significantly smaller mean PPGE than was attained by treatment with glibenclamide plus metformin, according to measurements taken after the day 14 afternoon standardised meal (89.5 vs 117.4 mg/dl, p = 0.011). The mean glibenclamide peak concentration (C(max)) was significantly greater (approximately 16%) after glibenclamide/metformin treatment on both days 1 and 14. Glibenclamide/metformin treatment was associated with a 2-fold greater area under the concentration-time curve to 3 hours for glibenclamide (AUC(3)) [p < 0.001], although the AUC over the administration interval was equivalent for both formulations.; In patients with type 2 diabetes, glibenclamide/metformin resulted in lower PPGE, suggesting that the higher glibenclamide AUC(3) observed with this formulation may contribute to better postprandial glycaemic control than is attained by glibenclamide plus metformin separately.",E,E

Subjects received nateglinide (30, 60, and 120 mg) or placebo before each main meal. Metabolic effectiveness was assessed during a standardized meal challenge performed before and after the 8-week treatment. All adverse events (AEs) were recorded, and confirmed hypoglycemia was defined as symptoms accompanied by a self-monitoring of blood glucose measurement < or =3.3 mmol/l (plasma glucose < or =3.7 mmol/l).; Nateglinide elicited a dose-related increase of insulin and a decrease of glucose during standardized meal challenges, with the predominant effect on early insulin release, leading to a substantial reduction in peak plasma glucose levels. Nateglinide was well tolerated, and symptoms of hypoglycemia were the only treatment-emergent AEs. Confirmed hypoglycemia occurred in 28 subjects receiving nateglinide (30 mg, 0 [0%]; 60 mg, 5 [6.6%]; 120 mg, 23 [26.7%]) and in 1 (2.3%) subject receiving placebo.; Nateglinide was safe and effective in reducing postprandial hyperglycemia in subjects with IGT.

A cocktail consisting of the selective substrates phenacetin (CYP1A2), tolbutamide (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), bufuralol (CYP2D6), and midazolam (CYP3A4) was incubated with human liver microsomes. The metabolic reactions were terminated with methanol containing dextrorphan as an internal standard. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by LC-MS-MS employing a fast gradient.

(2) The reference first-line drug therapy for type 2 diabetes, when drug therapy is needed, is single-agent treatment with metformin (a biguanide) for overweight patients, or with glibenclamide (a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea) for other patients. (3) If monotherapy fails to control blood glucose levels adequately, most clinical guidelines then recommend a combination of metformin with a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea, although the few available comparative clinical data raise the possibility of excess mortality with this treatment. (4) Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone (glitazones that reduce insulin resistance) have been authorized in the European Union for combination with a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea (for patients in whom metformin is ineffective or poorly tolerated) or with metformin (for obese patients). (5) None of the available trials of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone include data on mortality or morbidity. (6) There are fewer data on pioglitazone than on rosiglitazone. (7) According to short-term comparative trials, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are more effective than placebo on blood glucose levels. Combinations of rosiglitazone or pioglitazone with metformin or with glucose-lowering sulphonylureas have not been compared with the metformin + glucose-lowering sulphonylurea combination or with insulin. (8) Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone frequently cause weight gain. (9) Pioglitazone has a slightly favourable effect on lipid profiles, unlike rosiglitazone, which increases LDL-cholesterol levels. (10) The main side effect of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone is sodium and water retention, which can provoke oedema, anaemia (by haemodilution), and even heart failure. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are also hepatotoxic. (11) Combining rosiglitazone with insulin is contraindicated, owing to the increased risk of heart failure. The same applies to pioglitazone. (12) In practice, neither rosiglitazone nor pioglitazone has a place in the management of type 2 diabetes, except in the context of strictly controlled long-term comparative clinical trials.",E,E

Within kindreds, renal dysfunction often develops at a similar age in affected individuals, although there are known modifying factors. Two kindreds with ADPKD have shown a striking pattern of delayed onset of renal insufficiency in those individuals also suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus. Eight nondiabetic patients with ADPKD had onset of dialysis or renal death at ages 38-52 years, (mean +/- SEM 46 +/- 1.9, n = 7) as compared with four diabetics who started dialysis or are still off dialysis at the age of 61 +/- 2.8 years (p < 0.01). Two of the four diabetics still have reasonable renal function at age 61 and 66. The diabetes was diagnosed at age 32 +/- 2 years and was treated with oral hypoglycemics for 19 +/- 2 years before institution of insulin. Cardiovascular disease dominated the clinical picture in the diabetics. In conclusion, onset of renal failure in ADPKD was delayed for over 15 years in individuals who also suffered from type 2 diabetes mellitus, in two ADPKD kindreds. Possible mechanisms are discussed, including glibenclamide inhibition of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. The striking delay associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in ADPKD induced renal failure should be evaluated further.",E,E

Socio-demography, number of consultations, type of monotherapy and of association, duration of treatment, body mass index, fasting blood glycemia and post-prandial glycemia, blood pressure and type of complication were studied. There were 2.5 times more women than men with lower mean age for women. The majority of patients were from Dakar (81.6%). More than half of patients were women at home (60.5%). Present obesity (plethoric diabetes) or past obesity (metaplethoric diabetes) concerned 90.3% of patients. Patients have done 9.14   4.39 consultations under bitherapy. The gliclazide-metformin association was observed 37 times and the glibenclamide-metformin association 67 times.

The body mass index variations in diabetic patients showed a diminution of weight more in plethoric patients in bitherapy compared to monotherapy. This study is retrospective and cannot show the optimal efficacy of bitherapy. But the combination of enhancement of glucose captation and lowering of hepatic glucose production has been shown during this bitherapeutic association. Addition of metformine and treatment with sulfonylurea make a combination that significatively improves glycemic control but also cholesterol level and allows obtation of better weight in type 2 non insulin-dependent diabetes with insulinoresistance.",E,E

Forearm blood flow was assessed in 39 healthy subjects (23 males/16 females; age 22+/-4 years) using the technique of venous occlusion plethysmography. Resting forearm blood flow and functional hyperaemic blood flow (FHBF) were measured before and after brachial artery infusion of the K(ATP) channel inhibitors glibenclamide (at two different doses: 15 and 100 microg/min) and gliclazide (at 300 microg/min). FHBF was induced by 2 min of non-ischaemic wrist flexion-extension exercise at 45 cycles/min. Compared with vehicle (isotonic saline), glibenclamide at either 15 microg/min or 100 microg/min did not significantly alter resting forearm blood flow or peak FHBF. The blood volume repaid at 1 and 5 min after exercise was not diminished by glibenclamide. Serum glucose was unchanged after glibenclamide, but plasma insulin rose by 36% (from 7.2+/-0.8 to 9.8+/-1.3 m-units/l; P =0.02) and 150% (from 9.1+/-1.3 to 22.9+/-3.5 m-units/l; P =0.002) after the 15 and 100 microg/min infusions respectively. Gliclazide also did not affect resting forearm blood flow, peak FHBF, or the blood volume repaid at 1 and 5 min after exercise, compared with vehicle (isotonic glucose). Gliclazide induced a 12% fall in serum glucose (P =0.009) and a 38% increase in plasma insulin (P =0.001). Thus inhibition of vascular K(ATP) channels with glibenclamide or gliclazide does not appear to affect resting forearm blood flow or FHBF in healthy humans. These findings suggest that vascular K(ATP) channels may not play an important role in regulating basal vascular tone or skeletal muscle metabolic vasodilation in the forearm of healthy human subjects.",E,E

In this single-center, open-label, randomized, three-period crossover study, 27 healthy male subjects (15 Caucasian and 12 Japanese) each received three different single doses of repaglinide (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg) at consecutive 24-hour intervals. Pharmacokinetic profiles, including area under the curve (AUC0-t), maximum serum concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (tmax), and half-life (t1/2), were determined for each dose of repaglinide. The relative change in blood glucose level (RC1h) and area under the blood glucose curve (AUGC0-1) at 1 hour after dose were also measured. After oral dosing, both Cmax and AUC0-t increased linearly with dose within the 0.5- to 2.0-mg dose range, regardless of ethnic group. Both Cmax and AUC0-t were significantly higher in Japanese subjects than in Caucasian subjects. At each dose of repaglinide, Cmax and AUC were statistically significantly higher in Japanese than in Caucasian subjects (p = 0.0038 and 0.023, respectively). Discrepancies in body weight and body mass index (BMI) between Caucasian and Japanese subjects could not explain the between-group differences in Cmax or AUC0-t. Statistically significant differences in pharmacodynamic parameters (RC1h and AUGC0-1) were found between ethnic groups (p < 0.0001), the difference being more pronounced for RC1h than AUGC0-1. At a dose of 2.0 mg, the mean decrease in RC1h was 41% for Japanese subjects and 24% for Caucasian subjects. Hypoglycemic reactions were more common at the highest dose (2.0 mg), where they were observed more frequently in Japanese (7 cases) than in Caucasian subjects (4 cases). It was concluded that higher serum levels of repaglinide and greater reductions in blood glucose levels are found in Japanese than in Caucasian subjects following a single oral dose of repaglinide within the 0.5- to 2.0-mg dose range. Repaglinide is well tolerated in both ethnic groups. The results indicate that glycemic control targets may be achieved at lower doses within the recommended range (0.5-4.0 mg/meal) when repaglinide is used to treat Japanese patients in comparison to Caucasian patients.",3,E

Interaction of adenine nucleotides with Kir6.2 positively charged amino acids such as K185 and R201 on the C-terminus causes channel closure. Substitution of these amino acids with other positively charged residues had small effects on inhibition by adenine nucleotide, while substitution with neutral or negative residues had major effects, suggesting electrostatic interactions between Kir6.2 positive charges and adenine nucleotide negative phosphate groups. Furthermore, R201 mutation decreased channel sensitivity to ATP, ADP, and AMP to a similar extent, but K185 mutation decreased primarily ATP and ADP sensitivity, leaving the AMP sensitivity relatively unaffected. Thus, channel inhibition by ATP may involve interaction of the alpha-phosphate with R201 and interaction of the beta-phosphate with K185. In addition, decreased open probability due to rundown or sulfonylureas caused an increase in ATP sensitivity in the K185 mutant, but not in the R201 mutant. Thus, the beta-phosphate may bind in a state-independent fashion to K185 to destabilize channel openings, while R201 interacts with the alpha-phosphate to stabilize a channel closed configuration. Substitution of R192 on the C-terminus and R50 on the N-terminus with different charged residues also affected ATP sensitivity. Based on these results a structural scheme is proposed, which includes features of other recently published models.",5,E

Urinary albumin: creatinine ratio (ACR) was measured in a 52-week, open-label, cardiac safety study comparing rosiglitazone and glyburide. Patients were randomised to treatment with rosiglitazone 4 mg b.i.d. or glyburide. ACR was measured at baseline and after 28 and 52 weeks of treatment. Statistically significant reductions from baseline in ACR were observed in both treatment groups at week 28. By week 52, only the rosiglitazone group showed a significant reduction from baseline. Similar results were observed for the overall study population and for the subset of patients with baseline microalbuminuria. For patients with microalbuminuria at baseline, reductions in ACR did not correlate strongly with reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin, or fasting plasma glucose, but showed strong correlation with changes in mean 24-h systolic and diastolic blood pressure for rosiglitazone-treated patients (deltaACR vs deltamean 24-h systolic blood pressure, r=0.875; deltaACR vs deltamean 24-h diastolic blood pressure, r=0.755; P < 0.05 for both). No such correlation was observed for glyburide-treated patients. In conclusion, rosiglitazone treatment was associated with a decrease in urinary albumin excretion. These findings suggest a potential beneficial effect of rosiglitazone in the treatment or prevention of renal and vascular complications of type II diabetes.",E,E

The PKPD analysis used a nonlinear mixed effect modelling approach. A mixture model was used to identify patients with a FPG response to treatment. In patients identified as responders, the decrease in FPG was related to gliclazide exposure (AUC) by an Emax relationship. An effect compartment was used to describe the link between PK and PD. A linear disease-progression model was used to assess the glycaemic deterioration observable over several months of treatment. Simulations were performed to evaluate the predictive performance of the PKPD model and to illustrate the time course of the antidiabetic effect of gliclazide MR.; Disease state was found to be the main explanatory factor for intersubject variability in response to gliclazide. The percentage of responders to gliclazide, used as monotherapy, increased inversely to the number of classes of antidiabetic agents received prior to entry in the studies. In responders, the initial dose (30 mg) of the gliclazide MR dosing regimen induced half of the maximum hypoglycaemic effect. The equilibration half-life between the PK and PD steady states was 3 weeks (intersubject variability of 84%). The rate of disease progression was 0.84 mmol l(-1) year(-1) (intersubject variability 143%). The PKPD model adequately predicted the FPG profiles of 234 patients who received the current formulation of gliclazide. Simulation of a 1-year parallel dose ranging clinical trial illustrated the influence of dose, time and type of previous antidiabetic treatment on the percentage of patients with clinically significant improvement of blood glucose control.; This population PKPD analysis has characterized the relationship between the exposure to gliclazide and its long-term hypoglycaemic effect, and has established that the intersubject variability in response is mostly related to disease state. These results underline the clinical interest of quickly increasing the dose of gliclazide MR according to the response to treatment in order to achieve effective blood glucose control.",E,E

It is estimated that 10% of Mexican Americans >or=20 years of age have diabetes.; The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glimepiride, a long-acting sulfonylurea, as an adjunct to diet/exercise in Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes mellitus.; This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Mexican Americans with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, defined as a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level between 120 mg/dL and 225 mg/dL and glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) values between 8.0% and 10.5%, after >or=3 months of diet/exercise were enrolled. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio (using the lowest available treatment assignment number when eligibility was established) to receive 14 weeks of glimepiride or matching placebo once daily with continued diet/exercise. The starting glimepiride dose was 1 mg, with titration to 2 mg and 4 mg for FPG levels >120 mg/dL. The primary efficacy variable was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to study end point. Secondary efficacy variables were HbA(1c) response (rated as excellent, good, or marginal) and changes in FPG, fasting insulin, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels from baseline to study end point. The tolerability of glimepiride in this study population was determined by evaluating adverse events, hypoglycemic episodes, and physical examination as well as laboratory findings. All analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis. A per-protocol analysis also was conducted to support the primary efficacy analysis.; Seventy patients were randomized to treatment with glimepiride (n = 48) or placebo ((n = 22). The glimepiride and placebo groups were similar with respect to mean (SE) age (48.4 [11.7] and 50.7 [10.0] years, respectively) and sex (56.3% [27/48] and 50.0% [11/22] were male, respectively). However, the glimepiride group had a higher mean body weight (83.3 [17.0] vs 76.3 [18.5] kg) and a significantly higher mean fasting insulin level (23.8 [17.7] vs 17.8 [19.7] microU/mL; P = 0.031). The mean (SE) HbA(1c) values at study end point were 7.8% (0.2%) and 9.9% (0.7%) in patients receiving glimepiride and placebo, respectively. The adjusted mean difference in HbA(1c) reduction from baseline to end point was statistically significant in favor of glimepiride (-1.8% [0.4%]; P < 0.001). More pronounced HbA(1c) impairment at baseline was associated with greater glimepiride-placebo differences in HbA(1c) reduction. Glimepiride-treated patients also achieved a significantly greater improvement in FPG, with an adjusted mean (SE) treatment difference of -46.7 (16.7) mg/dL (P = 0.007). Glimepiride did not appear to affect fibrinogen and PAI-1 levels but was associated with significantly greater mean increases in fasting insulin (10.2 vs -2.1 microU/mL; P = 0.002) and body weight (2.3 vs 2.1 kg; P < 0.001) compared with placebo. Glimepiride was well tolerated, with an adverse-event profile similar to that of placebo.; These results indicate that once-daily glimepiride plus diet/exercise was effective in Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes whose disease was inadequately controlled with diet/exercise alone. It appeared to be well tolerated in the population studied. More weight gain was seen with glimepiride compared with placebo. Given the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes among Mexican Americans, further clinical studies of glimepiride and other glucose-lowering therapies are needed in this ethnic subset.",I,I
12637977,The relative contributions of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction to the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes.,"Adipose Tissue; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Islets of Langerhans","Kahn, S E","The relative contributions of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction to the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes have been debated extensively. The concept that a feedback loop governs the interaction of the insulin-sensitive tissues and the beta cell as well as the elucidation of the hyperbolic relationship between insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion explains why insulin-resistant subjects exhibit markedly increased insulin responses while those who are insulin-sensitive have low responses. Consideration of this hyperbolic relationship has helped identify the critical role of beta-cell dysfunction in the development of Type 2 diabetes and the demonstration of reduced beta-cell function in high risk subjects. Furthermore, assessments in a number of ethnic groups emphasise that beta-cell function is a major determinant of oral glucose tolerance in subjects with normal and reduced glucose tolerance and that in all populations the progression from normal to impaired glucose tolerance and subsequently to Type 2 diabetes is associated with declining insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function. The genetic and molecular basis for these reductions in insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function are not fully understood but it does seem that body-fat distribution and especially intra-abdominal fat are major determinants of insulin resistance while reductions in beta-cell mass contribute to beta-cell dysfunction. Based on our greater understanding of the relative roles of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in Type 2 diabetes, we can anticipate advances in the identification of genes contributing to the development of the disease as well as approaches to the treatment and prevention of Type 2 diabetes.",E,E

Numerous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes occur in pregnancy that can affect the efficacy and safety of drugs, and these are difficult to predict without appropriate studies. Drugs potentially useful and safe in pregnancy have to either not cross the placenta and/or be harmless to the fetus at clinically relevant concentrations. The first characteristic can be predicted using in vitro models such as the placenta perfusion model. In the case of glibenclamide (glyburide), in vitro experiments showed minimal maternal-fetal transfer, leading to completion of a successful clinical trial of this drug in gestational diabetes. Insulin, the main drug used in diabetes during pregnancy, has also been shown not to cross the placenta in vitro, as has insulin lispro. Animal insulin may cross the placenta when complexed with anti-insulin antibodies. Other sulphonylurea drugs (tolbutamide and chlorpropamide) have been shown to cross the placenta both in vitro and in vivo and to produce toxicity in the fetus.

Several studies done mainly by Italian investigators have proven this concept being true in studies with adequate baseline insulin coverage. Insulin aspart has appeared recently in the market in the United States with very similar effects to lispro. The FDA has recently approved a new ultralong acting analogue. The main advantages are its long, peakless action with better effects during down hours and a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia. We also review other approaches with novel insulin molecules attached to thyroxin or fatty acids in order to create a bridge for binding to plasmatic proteins. These molecules have longer effects and some of them more selective sites of action. Finally we included a brief review of other routes of insulin administration.",E,E

This phenomenon may be deleterious for the preservation of residual beta cell function in patients with slowly progressing type 1 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes of adult (LADA).; The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the exclusion of glibenclamide in the treatment of ICA positive type 2 diabetic patients may diminish or halt the humoral autoimmune response against B-cells as well as improve metabolic control and insulin secretion.; Fourteen type 2 diabetic patients with pancreatic autoimmunity (ICA+ and GABA+) and treated with insulin and glibenclamide (duration of disease 2.0 +/- 2.2, range 0.1-7 years and age 53 +/- 12.5, range 36-75 years) were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, Group 1: insulin monotherapy (n = 8, age 53 +/- 6.4 years) (Exclusion of glibenclamide) and, Group 2: insulin plus glibenclamide (n = 6, age 53.5 +/- 16.9) (Unmodified treatment). Both groups were investigated at the beginning of the study and after one year for the following parameters: ICA and anti-GAD65 antibodies, fasting glucose and fasting C-peptide.; In group 1, six out of eight patients became ICA negative while all patients in group 2 remained ICA positive (p = 0.0097). Fasting glucose concentrations improved in group 1 (4.6 +/- 2.8) in relation to group 2 (11.5 +/- 5.5, p = 0.0023) after one year of treatment. No differences were found for anti-GAD antibodies and fasting C-Peptide between the groups.; These data show that exclusion of glibenclamide in the treatment of ICA+ type 2 diabetic patients partially decreases specific autoimmunity against endocrine pancreatic cells and improves metabolic control. This may reflect decreased expression of B-cell autoantigens suggesting that insulin monotherapy is a better choice for the treatment of LADA.",E,E

Few data are available concerning their effects on metabolic parameters other than measures of glycemic control.; In addition to assessing the effects of repaglinide and glimepiride on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, this study also examined the effects of these agents on 3 metabolic parameters known to be cardiovascular risk factors--lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and homocysteine (Hcy).; This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted at a single center in Italy. Eligible patients were nonsmokers; had no hypertension or coronary heart disease; were taking no hypolipidemic drugs, diuretics, beta-blockers, or thyroxin; and had normal renal function. After an initial 4-week placebo washout period, patients were randomized to receive repaglinide 1 mg/d or glimepiride 1 mg/d. The dose of study drug was optimized over an 8-week titration period, which was followed by a 12-month treatment period. Measures of glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], fasting plasma glucose [FPG], postprandial plasma glucose [PPG], fasting plasma insulin [FPI], postprandial plasma insulin [PPI]) and the other metabolic parameters of interest were assessed after 6 and 12 months of treatment.; One hundred twenty-four patients (63 women, 61 men) completed the study, 62 in each treatment group. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between groups. After 6 and 12 months of treatment, FPG levels and HbA1c values were significantly reduced from baseline in both groups (6 months, P < 0.05; 12 months, P < 0.01). After 6 months, PPG levels were significantly decreased only in the repaglinide group (P < 0.05 vs baseline); at 12 months, however, PPG levels were significantly reduced from baseline in both groups (P < 0.01 repaglinide, P < 0.05 glimepiride). No significant changes from baseline in FPI or PPI levels were seen in either group at 6 months, although FPI levels were significantly increased in the repaglinide group at 12 months (P < 0.05). Repaglinide significantly lowered levels of Lp(a), PAI-1, and Hcy after 12 months (all, P < 0.05 vs baseline).

Drugs delaying or inhibiting carbohydrate absorption as well as insulin sensitizers have an unambiguous reducing effect on diabetic cardiovascular complications. Only fluid retention needs precaution during the treatment with thiazolidinedions in patients suffering from heart disease. Among insulin secretizers repaglinid, glibenclamid and glipizide have an ATP-sensitive potassium channel inhibiting effect in the vascular smooth muscle cells, too, reducing hereby vasodilation. Glibenclamide also inhibits ischaemic preconditioning. Therefore, the antidiabetic drug of choice can be decisive in diabetic patients suffering from ischaemic heart diseases or peripheral obliterative disorders. In the case of secondary sulphonylurea resistance and/or severe ischaemic alterations insulin treatment becomes necessary to avoid further cardiovascular complications.",E,E

In addition, the study assessed whether these outcomes were influenced by the patients' level of glycaemic control. A total of 253 patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio of repaglinide: placebo, with doses taken flexibly with main meals (2-4 per day), whenever they were eaten. Repaglinide was initiated at 0.5 mg per meal, increased to 1 mg after 4 weeks if fasting plasma glucose exceeded 7.8 mmol/l. QoL and treatment satisfaction outcomes were compared using generic and disease-specific self-assessment measures, previously applied in diabetes: the WHO Wellbeing Questionnaire (WHO-WBQ), WHO Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (WHO-DTSQ) and EuroQoL EQ-5D. Over the trial period, repaglinide-treated patients reported a significant 9% improvement in (WHO-DTSQ) treatment satisfaction score (p < 0.05). No significant increase was associated with placebo. The correlation between decrease in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and increase in treatment satisfaction (WHO-DTSQ) was -0.22 (p < 0.01). Scores obtained with the other measures did not change significantly during the trial in either group, but the cohort exhibited only a slight reduction in wellbeing (WHO-WBQ) and health status (EQ-5D) at baseline compared with the background population. In conclusion, flexible mealtime dosing with oral medication appears to be well accepted by pharmacotherapy-na茂ve patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that repaglinide provides a higher level of treatment satisfaction than placebo, and this may in part relate to improved glycaemic control.",I,I

Thiazolidinediones are ligands of the nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, and their antidiabetic effects appear to be mediated by activation of this receptor. The two currently marketed thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, display similar efficacies in their glucose lowering activities, but interestingly display slightly different clinical and side effect profiles.

The pharmacokinetic profile of repaglinide was altered by administration of potent inhibitors or inducers, such as ketoconazole or rifampicin, but to a lesser degree than expected. These results are probably explained by the metabolic pathway of repaglinide that involves other enzymes than CYP3A4, reflected to some extent by a small change in repaglinide pharmacodynamics. Thus, careful monitoring of blood glucose in repaglinide-treated patients receiving strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 is recommended, and an increase in repaglinide dose may be necessary.

Since then, a considerable body of evidence has been amassed regarding its use in type 2 diabetes.; This review provides a comprehensive summary of available data on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety profile of glimepiride in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It also examines the use of glimepiride to achieve and maintain good glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in current clinical practice.; Relevant articles were identified through a search of MEDLINE for English-language studies published from 1990 to 2002. The search terms used were glimepiride, sulfonylureas, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The manufacturer of glimepiride provided additional information.; Glimepiride differs from other SUs in a number of respects. In clinical studies, glimepiride was generally associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia and less weight gain than other SUs. Results of other studies suggest that glimepiride can be used in older patients and those with renal compromise. There is evidence that glimepiride preserves myocardial preconditioning, a protective mechanism that limits damage in the event of an ischemic event. Glimepiride can be used in combination with other oral antidiabetic agents or insulin to optimize glycemic control.; Based on the evidence to date, glimepiride is an effective and well-tolerated once-daily antidiabetic drug and provides an important treatment option for the management of type 2 diabetes.",I,I

Patients were, on average, obese (mean [SD] body mass index, 31.3 [4.7] kg/m2), had moderate to severe hyperglycemia (mean [SD] glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 8.7% [1.1]), and had a mean (SD) DM duration of 6.5 (4.9) years. Glipizide/ metformin tablets controlled the HbA1c level more effectively than did either glipizide or metformin monotherapies (mean treatment differences, in favor of glipizide/ metformin, of -1.06% and -0.98%, respectively, P < 0.001). At study end, an HbA1c level < 7.0% was achieved in approximately 4-fold more patients who were treated with glipizide/metformin (36.3%) compared with glipizide (8.9%) or metformin (9.9%) monotherapies. Glipizide/metformin tablets also reduced the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level and the 3-hour postprandial glucose area under the concentration-time curve more effectively than did either monotherapy, without increasing the fasting insulin level. The greater blood glucose control with glipizide/ metformin tablets was achieved at a mean daily dose of glipizide/metformin 17.5/1747 mg, compared with mean doses of glipizide 30.0 mg or metformin 1927 mg. Treatments were well tolerated, with a low incidence of symptoms of hypoglycemia evidenced by a fingerstick blood glucose measurement < or = 50 mg/dL in the combination group (12.6%); 1 patient discontinued the study treatment for this reason. No patient required medical assistance for hypoglycemia.; Glipizide/metformin tablets were more effective than either glipizide or metformin monotherapy in controlling HbA1c and in reducing FPG compared with baseline in patients with blood glucose that was uncontrolled with previous sulfonylurea treatment. In addition, patients receiving glipizide/ metformin were more likely to achieve an HbA1c level < 7.0%. These results were consistent with the synergistic effects on insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. Glipizide/metformin was well tolerated, with a low incidence of hypoglycemia.",I,E

For each first-line strategy, patients could progress to combination therapy using two or more agents prior to the introduction of insulin. The overall cost of treatment included costs (2001/2002 values; US dollars) of comprehensive medical care, laboratory tests, patient education, drug therapy, home glucose monitoring and adverse events.; At 3 years, the overall cost of treatment for the various first-line strategies was 6,106 US dollars for glipizide gastrointestinal therapeutic system, 6,727 US dollars for metformin immediate release, 6,826 US dollars for metformin extended release, 7,141 US dollars for glibenclamide (glyburide)/metformin, 7,759 US dollars for rosiglitazone and 9,298 US dollars for repaglinide. Costs of comprehensive routine medical care ranged from approximately 1,538-2,128 US dollars in year 1 and from approximately 952-1,543 US dollars in subsequent years, for controlled and uncontrolled patients, respectively. Adverse events represented <1%, and drug therapies represented approximately 50%, of the overall cost, respectively. Substantial cost differences between the strategies were seen within the first year. Regardless of first-line therapy, patients progressed quickly to combination therapies, with effectiveness among the agents being similar.; Short-term costs required to provide comprehensive diabetes care and achieve glycemic goals can be substantial. The model suggests a sulphonylurea strategy may provide similar effectiveness with cost savings over other agents and should be considered when selecting an initial drug therapy in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",5,E

This study examines the activity and safety of subcutaneously injected AC2993 in patients with type 2 diabetes currently treated with diet and/or oral antidiabetic agents (OAAs).; A total of 109 patients treated with diet and a sulfonylurea and/or metformin were enrolled in a blinded study. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three subcutaneously (SC) injected regimens of AC2993 (0.08 micro g/kg) or placebo for 28 days.; All three AC2993 regimens led to significant reductions in serum fructosamine relative to placebo (P <or= 0.004). Mean reductions ranged from 39 to 46 micro mol/l. All AC2993 groups had reductions in HbA(1c) ranging from 0.7 to 1.1% (P <or= 0.006). An end-of-study HbA(1c) <7% was achieved by 15% of AC2993 patients versus 4% of placebo patients, confirming AC2993 effects on fasting and postprandial glycemia. On days 14 and 28, the beta-cell index (homeostasis model assessment) for patients treated with AC2993 was 50-100% higher than baseline, contrasting with unchanged levels for placebo. The most common adverse event was transient mild-to-moderate nausea.; AC2993 is a promising therapeutic for patients with type 2 diabetes.

Theoretically, insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones (TZDs) should be beneficial in this patient population. A 74-year-old man with well-compensated systolic dysfunction and longstanding type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with glyburide began therapy with rosiglitazone 4 mg/day, which was increased to 8 mg/day after 1 month. Two weeks later he was seen with a 5-kg weight gain, shortness of breath, bibasilar rales, +S3 gallop, and increased jugular venous distention. Twelve days later symptoms worsened, with pulmonary edema on chest radiograph, continued weight gain, and +4 pitting edema resistant to oral diuretics. The patient was admitted to the hospital for exacerbation of heart failure. Five days after discharge he was readmitted for similar symptoms, including an 11.8-kg weight gain. He reported adherence to drug therapy and diet. Rosiglitazone was immediately discontinued and 11 days later the man's weight stabilized to 79 kg and remained between 79 and 80 kg 2 and 3 months after discharge. This case demonstrates that TZDs may precipitate weight gain and pulmonary and peripheral edema in patients with stable heart failure. Earlier reports documented similar symptoms in patients without a history of heart failure. Although current recommendations state that TZDs should not be administered to patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV disease, practitioners should be aware that these adverse effects also may occur in patients with milder forms heart failure as well as those without heart failure.",3,E

Because its insulinotropic effects are short in duration, nateglinide specifically targets postprandial hyperglycaemia with a low potential to elicit hypoglycaemia or sustained hyperinsulinaemia. Nateglinide has an excellent safety and tolerability profile, and its efficacy in reducing HbA1c in monotherapy (120 mg before meals) is comparable to that of metformin, sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones or acarbose (-0.5 to -1.5%). When combined with metformin, which primarily reduces fasting glucose levels, nateglinide's effects are additive. In our clinical experience, nateglinide is a particularly good therapeutic option in newly diagnosed, treatment-naive patients; elderly patients in whom hypoglycaemia is a concern; patients with kidney failure or mild hepatic impairment; patients taking low-dose sulphonylureas who encounter problems with hypoglycaemia; and patients failing to achieve adequate glycaemic control on metformin or thiazolidinedione monotherapy.",I,I

Next, we treated another group of 8 patients undergoing regular hemodialysis with nateglinide 90 mg/day for 1-3 months. The effect of hemodialysis on metabolite accumulation was then tested.; After a single 90 mg dose, nateglinide significantly increased the post-prandial secretion of insulin and thereby reduced plasma glucose levels. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC(0-6) 10.45 mg/l/h; t(1/2) 1.89 h, Cl/F 10.19 l/h) were comparable with those reported in healthy subjects. A much larger AUC value than those previously reported of M1, a major metabolite in the urine of healthy subjects, was observed, and the plasma concentration of M1 did not decline up to 6 hours after. In patients treated on a regular basis, there was marked accumulation of M1, while nateglinide could not be detected 24 hours after the last dose. Plasma M1 levels were significantly reduced by the hemodialysis sessions.; Single 90 mg dose of nateglinide was safe and effective in patients with renal failure. However, repeated administrations could cause prolonged hypoglycemia due to accumulation of M1, which is known to have a modest hypoglycemic activity. Hemodialysis may help to eliminate excessive accumulation of M1.",6,E

The study included 87 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 randomly distributed into 3 different treatment groups. Fasting and postprandial glucose were analyzed by enzymatic colorimetric method and HbA1c was measured by ion exchange chromatography. HbA1c significantly decreased in all three study groups. The decrease was mostly expressed among patients treated with lispro and metformin.

In fact, acute elevation of plasma glucose concentrations trigger an array of tissue response that may contribute to development of such vascular complications since it may result in a thrombophilic condition, causes endothelial dysfunction (possibly through a reduction of nitric oxide availability) and is responsible for non-enzymatic glycation and production of free- radicals with ensuing oxidative stress. To keep post-prandial glucose with narrow range, metiglinide analogues drugs have been developed. In particular, repaglinide and nateglinide seem the most useful ones. In fact, both drugs improve 1(st) phase insulin release but they do not affect the total daily amount of insulin released by the pancreas. Due to the mechanism of action and to pharmacokinetic properties, repaglinide and nateglinide allow diabetic patients to get a more tight metabolic glucose control with a contemporary reduction in the cases of severe hypoglycaemia. In conclusions, repaglinide and nateglinide are new and powerful pharmacological tools not only for achieving a better metabolic glucose control but also for preventing the development of diabetes-related cardiovascular complications.",5,E

Side effects were recorded in 10 patients treated with miglitol (flatulence and meteorism, diarrhoea, 1 discontinued therapy) and in 10 treated with glibenclamide (asthenia, sensation of hunger). This study indicates that miglitol is suitable for initial application in diet-resistant Type 2 diabetic patients, providing, a persistent effect and acceptable side effects.",E,E

The relative risks and benefits of intensive insulin therapy in NIDDM are not well defined. Accordingly, we designed a feasibility study that compared standard therapy and intensive therapy in a group of NIDDM men who required insulin due to sustained hyperglycemia.; A prospective trial was conducted in five medical centers in 153 men of 60 +/- 6 years of age who had a known diagnosis of diabetes for 7.8 +/- 4 years. They were randomly assigned to a standard insulin treatment group (one morning injection per day) or to an intensive therapy group designed to attain near-normal glycemia and a clinically significant separation of glycohemoglobin from the standard arm. A four-step plan was used in the intensive therapy group along with daily self-monitoring of glucose: 1) an evening insulin injection, 2) the same injection adding daytime glipizide, 3) two injections of insulin alone, and 4) multiple daily injections. Patient accrual and adherence, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), side effects, and measurements of endpoints for a prospective long-term trial were assessed.; Accrual goals were met, mean follow-up time was 27 months (range 18-35 months), and patients kept 98.6% of scheduled visits. After 6 months, the mean HbA1c in the intensive therapy group was at or below 7.3% and remained 2% lower than the standard group for the duration of the trial. Most of the decrease in the mean HbA1c in the intensive group was obtained by a single injection of evening intermediate insulin, alone or with daytime glipizide. By the end of the trial, 64% of the patients had advanced to two or more injections of insulin a day, aiming for normal HbA1c. However, only a small additional fall in HbA1c was attained. Severe hypoglycemia was rare (two events per 100 patients per year) and not significantly different between the groups, nor were changes in weight, blood pressure, or plasma lipids. There were 61 new cardiovascular events in 40 patients and 10 deaths (6 due to cardiovascular causes).; Intense stepped insulin therapy in NIDDM patients who have failed glycemic control on pharmacological therapy is effective in maintaining near-normal glycemic control for > 2 years without excessive severe hypoglycemia, weight gain, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. Cardiovascular event rates are high at this stage of NIDDM. A long-term prospective trial is needed to assess the risk-benefit ratio of intensified treatment of hyperglycemia in NIDDM patients requiring insulin.",I,I

The study will report in 1998, when the median duration from randomization will be 11 years. This report is on the efficacy of therapy over 6 years of follow-up and the overall incidence of diabetic complications. Subjects comprised 4,209 newly diagnosed type II diabetic patients who after 3 months' diet were asymptomatic and had fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 6.0-15.0 mmol/l. The study consists of a randomized controlled trial with two main comparisons: 1) 3,867 patients with 1,138 allocated to conventional therapy, primarily with diet, and 2,729 allocated to intensive therapy with additional sulfonylurea or insulin, which increase insulin supply, aiming for FPG < 6 mmol/l; and 2) 753 obese patients with 411 allocated to conventional therapy and 342 allocated to intensive therapy with metformin, which enhances insulin sensitivity. In the first comparison, in 2,287 subjects studied for 6 years, intensive therapy with sulfonylurea and insulin similarly improved glucose control compared with conventional therapy, with median FPG at 1 year of 6.8 and 8.2 mmol/l, respectively (P < 0.0001). and median HbA1c of 6.1 and 6.8%, respectively (P < 0.0001). During the next 5 years, the FPG increased progressively on all therapies (P < 0.0001) with medians at 6 years in the conventional and intensive groups, FPG 9.5 and 7.8 mmol/l, and HbA1c 8.0 and 7.1%, respectively. The glycemic deterioration was associated with progressive loss of beta-cell function. In the second comparison, in 548 obese subjects studied for 6 years, metformin improved glucose control similarly to intensive therapy with sulfonylurea or insulin. Metformin did not increase body weight or increase the incidence of hypoglycemia to the same extent as therapy with sulfonylurea or insulin. A high incidence of clinical complications occurred by 6-year follow-up. Of all subjects, 18.0% had suffered one or more diabetes-related clinical endpoints, with 12.1% having a macrovascular and 5.7% a microvascular endpoint. Sulfonylurea, metformin, and insulin therapies were similarly effective in improving glucose control compared with a policy of diet therapy. The study is examining whether the continued improved glucose control, obtained by intensive therapy compared with conventional therapy (median over 6 years HbA1c 6.6% compared with 7.4%), will be clinically advantageous in maintaining health.",I,I
7601013,Metformin. A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.,"Clinical Trials as Topic; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Metformin","Dunn, C J; Peters, D H","The biguanide metformin (dimethylbiguanide) is an oral antihyperglycaemic agent used in the management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It reduces blood glucose levels, predominantly by improving hepatic and peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin without affecting the secretion of this hormone. Metformin also appears to have potentially beneficial effects on serum lipid levels and fibrinolytic activity, although the long term clinical implications of these effects are unclear. Metformin possesses similar antihyperglycaemic efficacy to sulphonylureas in obese and nonobese patients with NIDDM. Additionally, interim data from the large multicentre United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) indicated similar antihyperglycaemic efficacy for metformin and insulin in newly diagnosed patients with NIDDM. Unlike the sulphonylureas and insulin, however, metformin treatment is not associated with increased bodyweight. Addition of metformin to existing antidiabetic therapy confers enhanced antihyperglycaemic efficacy. This may be of particular use in improving glycaemic control in patients with NIDDM not adequately controlled with sulphonylurea monotherapy, and may serve to reduce or eliminate the need for daily insulin injections in patients with NIDDM who require this therapy. The acute, reversible gastrointestinal adverse effects seen with metformin may be minimised by administration with or after food, and by using lower dosages, increased slowly where necessary. Lactic acidosis due to metformin is rare, and the risk of this complication may be minimised by observance of prescribing precautions and contraindications intended to avoid accumulation of the drug or lactate in the body. Unlike the sulphonylureas, metformin does not cause hypoglycaemia. Thus, metformin is an effective antihyperglycaemic agent which appears to improve aberrant plasma lipid and fibrinolytic profiles associated with NIDDM. Possible long term clinical benefits of this drug with regard to cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are not yet established but are being assessed in a major ongoing study. Since metformin does not promote weight gain or hypoglycaemia it should be considered first-line pharmacotherapy in obese patients with NIDDM inadequately controlled by nonpharmacological measures. Metformin appears similarly effective for the pharmacological management of NIDDM in nonobese patients.",E,E

Recently, however, metformin has been approved for the treatment of NIDDM.; We performed two large, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, controlled studies in which metformin or another treatment was given for 29 weeks to moderately obese patients with NIDDM whose diabetes was inadequately controlled by diet (protocol 1: metformin vs. placebo; 289 patients), or diet plus glyburide (protocol 2: metformin and glyburide vs. metformin vs. glyburide; 632 patients). To determine efficacy we measured plasma glucose (while the patients were fasting and after the oral administration of glucose), lactate, lipids, insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin before, during, and at the end of the study.; In protocol 1, at the end of the study the 143 patients in the metformin group, as compared with the 146 patients in the placebo group, had lower mean (+/- SE) fasting plasma glucose concentrations (189 +/- 5 vs. 244 +/- 6 mg per deciliter [10.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 13.7 +/- 0.3 mmol per liter], P < 0.001) and glycosylated hemoglobin values (7.1 +/- 0.1 percent vs. 8.6 +/- 0.2 percent, P < 0.001). In protocol 2, the 213 patients given metformin and glyburide, as compared with the 210 patients treated with glyburide alone, had lower mean fasting plasma glucose concentrations (187 +/- 4 vs. 261 +/- 4 mg per deciliter [10.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 14.6 +/- 0.2 mmol per liter], P < 0.001) and glycosylated hemoglobin values (7.1 +/- 0.1 percent vs. 8.7 +/- 0.1 percent, P < 0.001). The effect of metformin alone was similar to that of glyburide alone. Eighteen percent of the patients given metformin and glyburide had symptoms compatible with hypoglycemia, as compared with 3 percent in the glyburide group and 2 percent in the metformin group. In both protocols the patients given metformin had statistically significant decreases in plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, whereas the values in the respective control groups did not change. There were no significant changes in fasting plasma lactate concentrations in any of the groups.; Metformin monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin and sulfonylurea are well tolerated and improve glycemic control and lipid concentrations in patients with NIDDM whose diabetes is poorly controlled with diet or sulfonylurea therapy alone.",E,E

The mechanism for this difference is unclear. We have investigated in a cross-over study the effect of sulphonylurea and metformin therapy on energy expenditure and body composition in 10 Type 2 diabetic patients (7 females, 3 males) of various weights (mean body mass index 33.4 (SD 7.6 kg m-2)). Free living total energy expenditure was measured over 14 days by the doubly labelled water method adjusted for urinary glucose energy losses and resting energy expenditure by ventilated hood indirect calorimetry. Overall, total energy expenditure (12.88 +/- 4.17 vs 13.1 +/- 3.69 MJ 24 h-1) and resting metabolic rate (7.30 +/- 1.75 vs 7.23 +/- 1.74 MJ 24 h-1) were similar on metformin and sulphonylurea therapy, respectively. When adjusted for differences in fat free mass, resting metabolic rate on sulphonylurea therapy was slightly but significantly lower (mean difference -5.5 kJ 24 h-1 kg-1, 95% CI -1.2, -9.9 kJ 24 h-1 kg-1, p < 0.05). Fat free mass also increased significantly by 1.3 kg (95% CI 0.4, 2.4 kg, p < 0.05) when on sulphonylurea therapy, thus compensating for the lower resting metabolic rate per kg fat free mass to leave overall resting metabolic rate unchanged compared to metformin therapy. We also investigated the effect of adding metformin to six Type 2 diabetic patients already on insulin. This did not lead to any measurable changes in any of the components of energy expenditure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

Serial blood samples were collected before and at appropriate intervals after each glyburide dose to determine plasma concentrations and blood glucose levels. Values of Cmax and AUC of glyburide showed an equality of the two treatments by the analysis of variance. There was an apparent correlation between blood glucose level and the logarithm of plasma glyburide concentration; this relationship appeared to not be altered when glyburide was administered with orlistat. In conclusion, orlistat administered at doses of 80-mg three times daily does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics and blood glucose-lowering effect of a single 5-mg oral dose of glyburide in healthy volunteers.",E,E

Therefore, treatment that improves insulin action may also improve BP levels. Consequently, a four-phase (glipizide v insulin) cross-over design study was conducted to determine a better effect of glipizide treatment on insulin sensitivity and the effect this has on BP in 19 NIDDM patients. Patients were subjected to 1 month of diet only (phase I) followed by 3 months of glipizide treatment (phase II), then an additional 1 month of diet only (phase III), and finally 3 months of insulin treatment (phase IV). At the end of phases I, II, and IV oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed and plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels were analyzed. Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, glycated hemoglobin, fructosamine, and 2-h postprandial plasma glucose were also analyzed at each phase.

Clinical trials assessing effects on lipids and lipoproteins, and adverse effects of marketed lipid-lowering agents were extracted. Reviews and other relevant articles were included if they provided information regarding lipid and lipoprotein metabolism or guidelines on the treatment of dyslipidemias in patients with diabetes mellitus. An extensive review of clofibrate was not included. The most common dyslipidemia in patients with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is combined elevated triglyceride and cholesterol levels, with reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (mixed hyperlipidemia). Hypertriglyceridemia combined with a reduced HDL cholesterol is the most common dyslipidemia in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, but essentially any pattern of dyslipidemia may be present. Small and dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL), glycosylation of lipoproteins, and increased oxidized lipoproteins may be present in patients with diabetes mellitus; all contribute to accelerated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Insulin therapy generally corrects quantitative lipid abnormalities in patients with IDDM, so drug treatment is seldom indicated. Diet, exercise, and insulin or oral sulfonylureas will improve hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL concentrations, but do not always return them to normal. Drug therapy is indicated when nonpharmacologic measures are inadequate. It is administered based on the effects of each agent on lipids and lipoproteins, patient age, adverse effect profile, patient tolerability, and drug-disease and drug-drug interactions. A fibric acid derivative is the drug of choice for marked hypertriglyceridemia in patients with diabetes mellitus. Niacin can worsen glycemic control, but it may be required in severe hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, or mixed hyperlipidemia. Bile-acid binding resins may accentuate hypertriglyceridemia but may be useful in selected patients with marked hypercholesterolemia and normal triglycerides. Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reduced inhibitors are preferred in patients with elevated LDL cholesterol and mild hypertriglyceridemia. Patients with marked lipid abnormalities or mixed hyperlipidemias may require carefully dosed combinations of lipid-lowering drugs.",E,E

Of these, only 61 patients completed the study; 27 patients received insulin-placebo and 34 patients received insulin-glipizide. Three skeletal muscle (quadriceps femoris) biopsies were performed in all patients over a 3-year period. Glycosylated hemoglobin A1 was determined every 100 +/- 20 days, including plasma glucose levels. Muscle capillary basement membrane width was quantitated by a previously described method. After approximately 16 months, glycosylated hemoglobin A1 decreased significantly in each group from its baseline (P < 0.001 insulin-glipizide group and P < 0.025 insulin-placebo), although no statistically significant difference was seen between the two groups. After 3 years this decrease was statistically significant (P < 0.001) only in the insulin-glipizide group. At baseline, no statistically significant difference was found in the muscle capillary basement membrane width between the two groups. In spite of the significant decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin A1 in both groups after 14 to 16 months, only muscle capillary basement membrane width in the insulin-glipizide group decreased significantly compared with baseline. Patients receiving insulin-placebo showed a gradual increase in the muscle capillary basement membrane width, which after 3 years was significantly higher than baseline (P < 0.02). Although the mechanisms by which the addition of glipizide to insulin treatment reduced the thickening of the muscle capillary basement membrane are not clearly understood, the current findings suggest that diabetic microangiopathy is not necessarily progressive and that prophylaxis may be attained.",E,E

Prevention or delay of onset of hyperglycemia in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients should reduce morbidity and mortality from these complications. NIDDM can be nearly normoglycemic when diagnosed by screening before its symptomatic stage or when clinically hyperglycemic NIDDM goes into remission. One potential strategy to delay the onset of hyperglycemia in individuals at high risk is chronic low-dose sulfonylurea therapy. Thirty black NIDDM subjects who recently had developed near-normoglycemia were followed with no treatment or were randomly assigned to a 3-year, double-blind glipizide or placebo treatment. Baseline and follow-up parameters included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, plasma insulin, and glucose responses to an oral glucose tolerance test and insulin action, as determined by the euglycemic insulin clamp.

The ranking in order of efficacy was: acarbose-plus-tolbutamide, tolbutamide, acarbose, and placebo. The postprandial reductions in glucose were approximately 85 mg/dL for acarbose-plus-tolbutamide, 71 mg/dL for tolbutamide, 56 mg/dL for acarbose, and 13 mg/dL for placebo. Tolbutamide was associated with increases in body weight and postprandial insulin levels when taken alone, but these were ameliorated when tolbutamide was taken in combination with acarbose. Acarbose alone or in combination with tolbutamide caused significantly more gastrointestinal adverse events (mainly flatulence and soft stools or diarrhea) than tolbutamide or placebo, but these were generally well tolerated. Clinically significant elevations in hepatic transaminase levels occurred in 3 patients in the acarbose group and 2 in the acarbose-plus-tolbutamide group.

The main aim of this study was to assess whether glyburide, a selective blocker of KATP channels and commonly used antidiabetic agent, influences resting blood flow and reactive hyperemic response of peripheral tissues of normal subjects. Baseline calf blood flow was measured non-invasively in six normal subjects with femoral venous occlusive plethysmography. Calf blood flow was also serially measured every 30-60 s after the release of calf arterial occlusion (10 min duration). Reactive hyperemia was expressed in terms of peak post-occlusive flow, duration of hyperemia and reactive hyperemic volume. In each subject, baseline flow and reactive hyperemia were measured before (control) and every hour for 5 h after the oral ingestion of either 7.5 mg glyburide or a placebo on two separate days. Baseline calf flow declined by 30 and 42% of control values after 1 and 2 h of glyburide intake (P < 0.05) with a return to control values by hours 3, 4 and 5. Peak post-occlusive flow after 1, 2 and 3 h of glyburide ingestion was lower than control values by 22, 30 and 28%, respectively (P < 0.05). The duration of reactive hyperemia after 2 and 3 h of glyburide ingestion was significantly longer than control values (P < 0.05), whereas reactive hyperemic volume remained unaffected by glyburide intake. Placebo elicited no significant changes in baseline flow or reactive hyperemia throughout the 5-h experimental period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

Insulin may subsequently be required for optimal control in spite of peripheral hyperinsulinemia. In Mexico, diabetes associated with obesity is common. We therefore designed a prospective study combining insulin and chloropropamide in order to evaluate any improvement in insulin response to a standardized meal load and a consequent amelioration of glucose control. METHODS. Twenty diabetic patients with secondary failure to full doses of hypoglycemic drugs and moderate hyperglycemia were recruited. Therapy was initiated with human insulin 20 IU/day and 500 mg cholopropamide, titrating insulin dosage in order to achieve euglycemia. Before treatment and at the end of the study period, a glucose/insulin/C peptide response curve to a mixed standardized meal was performed. Blood glucose, serum lipids fructosamine and glycosylated hemoglobin levels were also determined. All patients were followed by capillary glucose measurements three times a week and glucose and fructosamine concentrations every two weeks during the study period. RESULTS. All patients required less insulin, and glucose control improved significantly. Glucose, fructosamine and glycosylated hemoglobin levels decreased from 262 mg/dL, 369 mmol/L and 14% to 111 mg/dL, 252 mmol/L, and 8% respectively; all differences were statistically significant. Insulin and C peptide levels increased significantly from 22.2 mU/mL and 1.65 ng/mL to 29.8 mU/mL and 1.97 ng/mL, respectively. When we measured the area under the curve, total values improved from 110 and 7.69 to 127 and 9.37, respectively; this was also statistically significant. Lipids levels decreased significantly, including triglicerides, total and LDL cholesterol whereas HDL cholesterol levels increased. CONCLUSIONS. Glucose control improved in our patient cohort the pancreatic insulin response probably due to a more adequate glycemic microenvironment and a possible enhanced exogenous and endogenous insulin function.",E,E

Furthermore, we studied the effect of insulin treatment on serum Lp(a) in 108 patients with NIDDM. Male and female NIDDM patients had similar Lp(a) concentrations to healthy controls (median value 167 mg L-1, range 15-1550 mg L-1 vs. 157 mg L-1, range 15-919 mg L-1, NS and 92, range 15-1190 mg L-1 vs. 103 mg L-1, range 15-842 mg L-1, NS). Also, the cumulative distribution of Lp(a) did not differ between the NIDDM patients and healthy subjects. Insulin treatment increased Lp(a) in diabetics with a Lp(a) concentration of less than 300 mg L-1, but this effect was not related to the concomitant improvement in metabolic control (mean change (+/- SEM) of HbA1c from 9.80 +/- 0.15 to 8.00 +/- 0.12; P < 0.001). In subjects with elevated Lp(a) concentrations (> 300 mg L-1) the Lp(a) concentration was unaffected by insulin, despite a similar improvement in glycaemic control. These results suggest that insulin may modulate the concentration of Lp(a).",E,E

Fasting glucose, GHb, lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were determined, and resistance to insulin-mediated glucose disposal was estimated by measuring the steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration at the end of a 180-min infusion of somatostatin, glucose, and insulin. In addition, plasma glucose, insulin, and TG concentrations were measured at frequent intervals from 0800 to 2400, with patients eating breakfast at 0800 and lunch at 1200. Vitamin A was also given at lunch, and the retinyl ester content in plasma and in chylomicron (Svedberg flotation constant [Sf] > 400) and the chylomicron remnant (Sf 20-400) fractions were used to quantify the concentration of postprandial intestinal TG-rich lipoprotein from 1200 to 2400.; Fasting plasma glucose concentrations (6.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 10.5 +/- 0.4 mmol/l), GHb levels (7.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 10.8 +/- 0.5%), and day-long plasma glucose concentrations were all significantly lower after metformin treatment (P < 0.001), which was associated with a significant (P < 0.001) fall in SSPG concentration (11.0 +/- 0.9 to 9.6 +/- 0.6 mmol/l).

The dose was titrated, with FBG < 6.7 mmol/l as target, using, at most, six dose levels. The first three dose levels comprised increasing single-drug therapy (M or G) or primary combination at increasing but low dosage (MGL), and the second three levels were composed of various high-dose combinations, i.e., add-on therapy (M/G or G/M) and primary combination escalated to high dosage (MGH). Medication was maintained for 6 months after completed dose titration.; The FBG target was achieved in 9% of patients after diet alone. Single-drug therapy was insufficient in 36% and MGL in 25% (NS) of the randomized patients. There was further improvement in glucose control by the high-dose combinations. Mean FBG +/- SE was reduced (P = 0.001) from 9.1 +/- 0.4 to 7.0 +/- 0.2 mmol/l in those maintained on single-drug treatment or low-dose primary combination. Those treated with different high-dose combinations had a large mean FBG reduction, from 13.3 +/- 0.8 to 7.8 +/- 0.6 mmol/l. HbA1c levels showed corresponding reductions, and glycemic levels rose after drug discontinuation. Fasting C-peptide rose during treatment with G and MGL but not with M, while fasting insulin was not significantly changed. Meal-stimulated C-peptide and insulin levels were unchanged by M but increased by G and, to a lesser extent, by MGL. There were no significant insulin or C-peptide differences between the different high-dose combinations (M/G, G/M, and MGH). Body weight did not change following treatment with M or combination but increased by 2.8 +/- 0.7 kg following G alone. Blood pressure was unchanged. Overall effects on plasma lipids were small, with no significant differences between groups. Drug safety was satisfactory, even if the reporting of (usually modest) adverse events was high; the profile, but not the frequency, differed between groups.; Dose-effect titrated treatment with either metformin or glyburide promotes equal degrees of glycemic control. The former, but not the latter, is able to achieve this control without increasing body weight or hyperinsulinemia.

Exclusion criteria were overt diabetic neuropathy or retinopathy. The control subjects were 12 healthy subjects matched for age and sex. Fifty-two other subjects formed a reference control population. The intra-individual coefficient of variation for P100 latency was < 3%.; The P100 latencies were longer in diabetic patients than in control subjects (means of both eyes +/- SD: 116.8 +/- 10.1 vs. 106.2 +/- 4.5 ms, P < 0.01), and 4 of the 12 diabetic patients had abnormal VEPs. After 3 days of close blood glucose control (mean blood glucose profile fell from 13.7 +/- 2.2 mmol/l to 6.8 +/- 1.2 mmol/l, P < 0.01), the mean P100 latencies were significantly shorter (112.5 +/- 7.6 ms, P < 0.01) but were still significantly longer than control values. The longer the initial P100 latency, the greater the decrease after CSII. There was no correlation between the fall in blood glucose and improvement in VEPs.; Short-term blood glucose normalization is associated with improved P100 wave latency in uncomplicated diabetic patients. These data suggest that abnormal VEPs are partly reversible and include functional disturbances related to glucose metabolism.",E,E

Glyburide doses were titrated with a target goal of achieving a fasting plasma glucose of < or = 7.8 mmol/l or to reach maximum daily doses of 20 mg.; A significant prolongation in the elimination half-life (t1/2: week 0, 4.0 +/- 1.9 h; week 6, 13.7 +/- 10.5 h; and week 12, 12.1 +/- 8.2 h) and an increased volume of distribution of glyburide was observed during chronic dosing. These results strongly suggest possible drug accumulation. No differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were noted between evaluations at week 6 or week 12. Changes in pharmacodynamic response of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide to chronic glyburide therapy were observed. Glyburide therapy significantly reduced plasma glucose levels at weeks 6 and 12 (percent changes in AUC0-->4. glucose from baseline: week 0, -3 +/- 11%; week 6, -29 +/- 13%; and week 12, -26 +/- 19%). Pancreatic insulin secretion was acutely enhanced and maintained during long-term therapy. Responsiveness to therapy as assessed by the ratio of AUC0-->4.glucose:AUC0-->4.C-peptide was significantly improved at all weeks compared with baseline. No pharmacodynamic response differences were observed between the week 6 and the week 12 evaluations.; This study demonstrates that significant differences in glyburide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics exist between single-dose and steady-state conditions. These differences support the need for careful dosage titration of glyburide to achieve a desired therapeutic response in patients with type II diabetes.",I,I

Adverse effect profiles differ markedly between the sulphonylureas and biguanides, reflecting differences in chemical structure and mode of action. Sulphonylureas are generally well tolerated, although pharmacokinetic differences between these agents have important clinical implications. The main adverse effect associated with sulphonylureas is hypoglycaemia. This effect is a predictable consequence of the principal pharmacological effect of these drugs, i.e. sensitisation of the islet beta-cell to glucose, resulting in enhanced endogenous insulin secretion. Sulphonylurea-induced suppression of hepatic glucose production may cause profound and protracted hypoglycaemia, especially in elderly patients, in individuals with intercurrent illnesses and reduced caloric intake, or when taken in combination with other compounds with hypoglycaemic potential, e.g. alcohol (ethanol). Sulphonylureas with a longer duration of action, notably chlorpropamide and glibenclamide (glyburide), are more liable to induce serious hypoglycaemia, particularly when drug elimination is reduced by renal impairment. Other drugs such as salicylates may potentiate the actions of sulphonylureas, thereby increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. Biguanide therapy is associated with alterations in lactate homeostasis which under certain clinical circumstances may result in fatal lactic acidosis. Phenformin is associated with a markedly greater risk of lactic acidosis than metformin. Phenformin has been withdrawn in many countries for this reason. All biguanides must be avoided in patients with renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction and cardiac failure--conditions where drug accumulation or disordered lactate metabolism may predispose to lactic acidosis. Phenformin should not be given to individuals who exhibit a severe, genetically conferred hepatic defect of hydroxylation which impedes metabolism of this drug. Less seriously, the biguanides are associated with a relatively high incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit compliance. Acarbose, a competitive inhibitor of intestinal alpha-glucosidases, has recently been introduced. In contrast to the sulphonylureas and biguanides, acarbose has not been associated with life-threatening adverse effects. This reflects the low systemic absorption of the drug and, predictably, its principal unwanted effects are gastrointestinal disturbances resulting from iatrogenic carbohydrate malabsorption.",I,I

Therefore, we compared the effects of ethnicity on glucose/insulin/C-peptide dynamics, hepatic insulin extraction, and insulin sensitivity in healthy black (n = 32) and white (n = 30) Americans. Standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and tolbutamide-modified, frequently sampled, intravenous glucose tolerance (FSIVGT) tests were performed in each subject. Insulin sensitivity index (S1)) was calculated using the MINIMOD method described by Bergman et al. Basal and post-stimulation hepatic insulin extraction were calculated by the molar ratios of C-peptide and insulin concentrations during the basal steady state and areas under the post-stimulation hormone curves, respectively. Apart from a slightly greater mean serum glucose peak response after oral glucose in the whites, mean glucose levels were identical in the blacks and whites during both stimulations. In contrast, serum insulin levels at basal and during both stimulations were significantly greater (2-3 fold) in the blacks than whites. However, the corresponding C-peptide responses were identical in both groups. The basal and postprandial hepatic insulin extraction were 33% and 45% lower in the blacks when compared to whites, respectively. The mean S1 was significantly (p < 0.02) lower in the blacks (4.93 +/- 0.46) than the whites (7.17 +/- 0.88 x 10(-4).min-1 (mU l-1)-1).

All the patients were admitted to our coronary care unit with their first myocardial infarction.; Ventricular fibrillation occurred in 1.9% of group A1, 7.9% of group A2, and 9.9% of the non-diabetic (A1 versus A2, P < 0.05; A2 versus the non-diabetic group, NS; A1 versus the non-diabetic group, P < 0.01). Sustained ventricular tachycardia was not significantly different among the groups.; The antiarrhythmic effectiveness of glibenclamide might be related to its blocking action on the ATP-dependent potassium channel, with consequent attenuation of the efflux of potassium induced by ischemia. We also observed a higher mortality rate resulting from heart failure in group A2 than in group A1 or the non-diabetic group. Since glibenclamide has never shown significant effects on myocardial contractility, this finding remains to be elucidated. Glibenclamide therefore appears to have an antifibrillatory effect in acute myocardial infarction; with respect to acute coronary events, the drug might be able to prevent ventricular fibrillation, which is most often fatal when it occurs before hospitalization.",E,E

Its mechanism of action, unknown until a few years ago, is now linked to an improved peripheral sensitivity to insulin, through a stimulated tissue glucose uptake by a transporter linked system. Interest in metformin has been revived by the recent observation of a specific activity of this agent on some of the major traits of the so called 'polymetabolic syndrome' (or 'syndrome X'), characterized by: insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension and reduced fibrinolytic activity. Metformin, in studies examining one or more of these, has been shown, possibly through its peripheral insulin sensitizing mechanism, to correct most of the major symptoms characterizing this insulin resistance syndrome. Metformin, similarly to the other biguanide phenformin, has been rated as potentially dangerous, because of the possible induction of lactic acidosis, in some cases with a fatal outcome. Metformin is, however, associated with a very low incidence of lactic acidosis because, differently from phenformin, it does not undergo liver metabolism and, as a consequence, there are no high-risk groups, displaying an impaired metabolic handling. In this review, in addition to an overall evaluation of the more recent data on the mechanism of action and clinical use of metformin, a detailed clinical analysis of all published cases of lactic acidosis is provided. These data indicate that the risk in metformin use is negligible, provided that care is taken when prescribing the drug to patients with suspected clinical risks of lactic acidosis.",E,E

The exact mechanism is unknown. In an attempt to describe the direct effect of glyburide on glucose metabolism, a very low dose of glyburide (20 micrograms/kg body weight) was given orally to 12 healthy volunteers in an attempt to increase blood concentrations of the drug without causing a marked increase in insulin secretion. Fasting hepatic glucose production (HGP), carbohydrate oxidation (CO), leucine appearance, leucine oxidation, and fat oxidation were determined between hours 3 and 4 and hours 7 and 8. The changes seen in the glyburide-treated volunteers were compared with the changes seen in 5 non-treated, healthy volunteers during the same 8-hour period. Mean blood glucose decreased greater in the glyburide-treated volunteers (20 +/- 2% vs 5 +/- 2%, P < 0.01).

Glucose responses to Sustacal were similar after both formulations of glipizide; however, serum insulin (P < 0.01) and C-peptide responses (P < 0.05) were lower with glipizide-GITS than with immediate-release glipizide treatment at the end of the 8-week treatment phase. Mean plasma glipizide concentrations were stable by the end of week 1, and the concentrations increased proportionately with dose. Once-daily Glipizide-GITS provided effective mean glipizide concentrations (> 50 ng/ml) 24 h after dosing, even at the lowest (5 mg) dose level. Both formulations were well tolerated.; Glipizide-GITS was significantly more effective than immediate-release glipizide in reducing FPG levels. Both formulations reduced postprandial plasma glucose levels equally; however, glipizide-GITS exerted its control in the presence of lower plasma glipizide concentrations in addition to significantly lower insulin and C-peptide levels. This suggests that glipizide-GITS improves insulin sensitivity.",I,I

When the drugs were combined, a slightly greater FBG reduction (p = 0.026) was observed, at lower dosage (p = 0.013). The response could not be predicted from body weight, but depended upon initial FBG (p = 0.019) and meal-stimulated C-peptide (p = 0.007).

During the initial 6-month comparison fasting, blood sugar concentration decreased 5% in bedtime ingesters and rose 10% in the morning patients. These changes were not statistically significant. HbA1c decreased significantly in the morning group but remained unchanged in the bedtime group. At the end of 12 months, nighttime dosing resulted in better home glucose monitoring values, fasting blood sugar results, and Sustacal tolerance profiles, but the differences were not statistically significant.

When all patients were examined, mean stimulated C-peptide levels at 4 weeks (0.58 +/- 0.09 pm/ml) were increased compared to time 0 (0.32 +/- 0.05 pm/ml, p < 0.02). Patients not entering remission had higher 4-week stimulated values (0.67 +/- 0.12 pm/ml) compared to time 0 values (0.29 +/- 0.06 pm/ml, p < .01), whereas remission patients' mean C-peptide levels remained similar at 0, 4, 8 and 24 weeks. These data indicate that a) insulin treatment plus glipizide induces higher rates of remission compared to intensive insulin treatment alone, b) the intensity of initial metabolic control may be an important determinant for remission induction, and c) endogenous insulin secretion is not associated with remission induction, suggesting that glipizide alters insulin sensitivity or is immunomodulatory in the context of new onset type 1 diabetes.",E,E

Plasma glucose, insulin, intact and 32/33 split proinsulin were measured at diagnostic OGTT. After 8-12 weeks on a conventional diet, subjects with a fasting glucose > 9 mmol l-1 (n = 12) were commenced on sulphonylurea therapy. At diagnosis, the sulphonylurea requiring group were more hyperglycaemic (p < 0.0001), less obese (p < 0.05) and more insulin deficient with a lower 30 min insulin (p < 0.0002) than the diet group. Following dietary intervention in the sulphonylurea group, weight remained unchanged but there was a reduction in fasting glucose (p < 0.009). Fasting insulin, intact proinsulin, and 32/33 split proinsulin remained unchanged. After 12 weeks of sulphonylurea therapy there was a weight gain of 1.5 kg (p < 0.01), but a reduction in fasting glucose (p < 0.0001). Fasting insulin and intact proinsulin increased (p < 0.004) but 32/33 split proinsulin remained unchanged. There was a significant increase in both the fasting insulin to glucose ratio (p < 0.005), and intact to 32/33 split proinsulin ratio (p < 0.02). Final fasting glucose following sulphonylurea therapy was positively correlated with the initial intact and 32/33 split proinsulin and the fasting glucose following dietary treatment. It is clear from this work that sulphonylureas have a complex effect on beta cell physiology and as well as stimulating release of insulin they increase the release of intact proinsulin but not that of 32/33 split proinsulin, hence they increase the intact to 32/33 split proinsulin ratio.",E,E

During the clamp a small replacement dose of insulin was given (0.15 mU/kg per min). Isotopically determined glucose-induced glucose uptake was similar before and after GZ administration which led to improved glycaemic control (basal plasma glucose 12.2 +/- 1.3 vs 8.9 +/- 0.7 mmol/l; P < 0.01). Glucose-induced suppression of HGP was, however, more pronounced during GZ treatment (0.96 +/- 0.14 vs 1.44 +/- 0.20 mg/kg per min; P < 0.02). Following GZ treatment hyperglycaemia failed to stimulate glycogen synthase activity. Moreover, GZ resulted in a significant increase in the immunoreactive abundance of the insulin-regulatable glucose transport protein (GLUT 4) (P < 0.02). In conclusion, these results suggest that GZ therapy in type 2 diabetic patients enhances hepatic sensitivity to hyperglycaemia, while glucose-induced glucose uptake remains unaffected. In addition, GZ tends to normalize the activity of glycogen synthase and increases the content of GLUT 4 protein in skeletal muscle.",E,E

In some animal species, myocardial preconditioning appears to be due to activation of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. The role played by KATP channels in preconditioning in humans remains unknown. The aim of this study was to establish whether glibenclamide, a selective KATP channel blocker, abolishes the ischemic preconditioning observed in humans during coronary angioplasty following repeated balloon inflations.; Twenty consecutive patients undergoing one-vessel coronary angioplasty were randomized to receive 10 mg oral glibenclamide or placebo. Sixty minutes after glibenclamide or placebo administration, patients were given an infusion of 10% dextrose (8 mL/min) to correct glucose plasma levels or, respectively, an infusion of saline at the same infusion rate. Thirty minutes after the beginning of the infusion, both patient groups underwent coronary angioplasty. The mean values (+/- 1 SD) of ST-segment shifts on the surface 12-lead ECG and the intracoronary ECG were measured at the end of the first and second balloon inflations, both 2 minutes long. In glibenclamide-treated patients, the mean ST-segment shift during the second balloon inflation was similar to that observed during the first inflation (23 +/- 13 versus 20 +/- 8 mm, P = NS), and the severity of cardiac pain was greater (55 +/- 21 versus 43 +/- 23 mm on a scale of 0 to 100, P < .05). Conversely, in placebo-treated patients the mean ST-segment shift during the second inflation was less than that during the first inflation (9 +/- 5 versus 23 +/- 13 mm, P < .001), as was the severity of cardiac pain (15 +/- 15 versus 42 +/- 19 mm, P < .01). Blood glucose levels were significantly reduced 60 minutes after glibenclamide compared with those at baseline (53 +/- 9 versus 102 +/- 10 mg/100 mL, P < .001) in the glibenclamide group; however, before coronary angioplasty, blood glucose levels increased to 95 +/- 19 mg/100 mL, a value similar to that found in placebo group (96 +/- 11 mg/100 mL, P = NS).; In humans, ischemic preconditioning during brief repeated coronary occlusions is completely abolished by pretreatment with glibenclamide, thus suggesting that it is mainly mediated by KATP channels.",E,E

In all patients the family history of diabetes and the presence and degree of vascular complications were registered. Evident flushing phenomenon was observed in 6 patients treated with chlorpropamide, in 3 treated with tolbutamide, in 2 treated with glibenclamide, in one receiving glibornuride and in none treated with glipizide. All drugs caused a greater rise of blood ethanol and acetaldehyde levels in relation to the control tests, but the difference reached statistical significance only in the group receiving chlorpropamide. Moreover, patients (pooled) with positive thermographic response had also significantly higher blood levels of ethanol and acetaldehyde during the second test.

Efficacy, based on fasting blood glucose (BG), BG 1 h after ingestion of standard breakfast (postprandial), serum insulin, postprandial insulin increase, and HbA1c; and tolerability, based on subjective symptoms and laboratory values, were investigated every 6 weeks. Efficacy evaluation was valid for 85 patients.; The test drugs were dosed as follows: 100 mg acarbose (A) three times a day, 1 placebo tablet three times a day, 3.5 mg glibenclamide tablets dosed 1-0-0 or 1-0-1, mean dose 4.3 mg/day. Compared with the placebo, both drugs showed the same mean efficacy on fasting BG (-1.4 mM with acarbose, -1.6 mM with glibenclamide), 1-h postprandial BG (-2.2 mM with acarbose, -1.9 mM with glibenclamide), and HbA1c (-1.1% with acarbose, -0.9% with glibenclamide); but they showed a marked difference in 1-h postprandial insulin values (-80.7 pM with acarbose, 96.7 pM with glibenclamide). The mean relative insulin increase (1-h postprandial) was 1.5 in the placebo group, 1.1 in the acarbose group, and 2.5 in the glibenclamide group. No changes in body weight could be observed. No adverse events were seen under placebo. Acarbose led to mild or moderate intestinal symptoms in 38% of patients. Glibenclamide led to hypoglycemia, which could be solved by dose reduction, in 6% of patients. No dropouts occurred in any of the treatment groups.; Acarbose and glibenclamide are effective drugs for the monotherapy of NIDDM patients when diet alone fails.

Patients who achieved glycemic control (fasting plasma glucose of < or = 8.9 mmol/L, or 160 mg/dl, on two consecutive occasions) entered a maintenance phase, for a total treatment period of 4 months. Hypoglycemia was defined as a fasting plasma glucose of < 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dl) or a random plasma glucose of < 2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dl), with associated signs and symptoms. Most patients in both the glyburide and glipizide groups achieved satisfactory glycemic control; there were no significant differences between groups in fasting plasma glucose or hemoglobin A1c levels at any time. Of note, the mean dose of glyburide (8.5 mg/day) was approximately half that of glipizide (15.4 mg/day) at the end of the maintenance period (P = 0.009). Both regimens were well tolerated and were associated with a similarly low incidence of hypoglycemia.

Of decisive importance is the timing of their use, together with a knowledge of their specific properties. Acarbose, which needs to be initiated at a low, slowly increasing dose, is noted for the fact that it has virtually no systemic side effects. Metformin reduces plasma glucose levels without inducing hyperinsulinemia, and carries virtually no risk of lactic acidosis. Glibenclamide can be used either alone to treat type 2 diabetes or in combination with other oral antidiabetics or insulin. Today, intensified insulin therapy represents the optimal standard of insulin replacement. It permits meal-oriented injection of normal insulin and the use of longer-acting insulin overnight. This form of treatment is now facilitated by the possibilities of plasma glucose selfmonitoring and the use of injection aids (pen). Intensified treatment should be initiated at the time type I diabetes is diagnosed. In the case of a particularly instable metabolic situation or neuropathy, it may become necessary to use insulin pumps.",E,E

The mean fasting plasma glucose (249 +/- 11 vs 170 +/- 10 mg/dl, p < 0.001), postprandial plasma glucose (353 +/- 16 vs 237 +/- 16 mg/dl, p < 0.001) and HbA1C (9.6 +/- 0.4 vs 6.5 +/- 0.3% p < 0.001) decreased significantly after 3-months of gliclazide treatment. The beta cell function showed a significant increase in fasting serum C-peptide (1.8 +/- 0.2 vs 2.1 +/- 0.3 ng/ml, p < 0.05) and an insignificant increment in serum C-peptide after glucagon stimulation (2.2 +/- 0.3 vs 2.2 +/- 0.4 ng/ml, p < 0.1). In 8 cases with an initial serum cholesterol above 200 mg/dl, the serum cholesterol decreased significantly (236 +/- 8 vs 200 +/- 12 mg/dl, p < 0.05). However, LDL-cholesterol (164 +/- 8 vs 145 +/- 13 mg, p > 0.05) and HDL-cholesterol (66 +/- 5 vs 54 +/- 9 mg, p > 0.05) showed insignificant decrease after gliclazide therapy. In 4 patients with hypertriglyceridemia, the serum triglyceride decreased (441 +/- 161 vs 239 +/- 73 mg/dl, p > 0.1), but this was not statistically significant. These findings suggest that hyperglycemia, fasting serum C-peptide levels and hypercholesteremia are significantly improved after a 3-month period of gliclazide therapy in NIDDM patients.",E,E

The high rate of microvascular and macrovascular complications developing in these patients will place an even higher burden on our healthcare systems. Several pathophysiological factors are involved in the development of complications, among which are hyperglycaemia per se, the consequent formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and the intracellular accumulation of sorbitol. In addition, hypertension and dyslipidaemia also play an important role, especially in the development of coronary heart disease and stroke. The major therapeutic goals in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are to reduce obesity and normalise lipid disturbances and increased blood pressure, in order to improve the well-being of the patient and reduce the risk of the development of late diabetic complications. Often, pharmacological treatment of the hyperglycaemia is necessary, in which case sulphonylureas, metformin, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose, or insulin may be employed. It is believed that medical interventions, by their effect on improving metabolic control, reduce the incidence and severity of diabetic complications, especially when considering the toxic effects of glucose and the accumulation of AGEs as a consequence of raised tissue glucose levels. This concept is also based on extrapolation of the finding of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial that intensive glycaemic control in IDDM will prevent the progression of at least the microvascular complications like retinopathy and nephropathy. There are, however, no long term studies in NIDDM patients to show that treatment with oral antihyperglycaemic agents helps to postpone or prevent complications. It is expected that the UK Prospective Diabetes Study will show whether better metabolic control, either with oral antihyperglycaemics or with insulin, will indeed improve outcome. Several other studies aiming at specific risk factor intervention (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, lipid oxidation) in NIDDM patients are currently ongoing.",E,E

In a four-month comparative study, 36 Type 2 diabetic patients given SFS were allocated to three treatment groups: A (n = 12, M/F 6/6, HbAlc 9.1 +/- 1.6%) received 0.3 IU/Kg body weight (BW) of insulin-Zn between 10 and 11 p.m.; B (n = 12, M/F 6/6, HbAlc 9.2 +/- 1.6%) SFS plus 850 mg/day of metformin; and C (n = 12, M/F 6/6, HbAlc 9.5 +/- 2.4%) SFS plus acarbose 3 x 100 mg daily. Modifications in HbAlc, BW, blood pressure (BP), lipoprotein profile and insulin sensitivity were evaluated. HbAlc decreased in the three groups (A: 17.9 +/- 13.5%; B: 18.2 +/- 4.5%; C: 7.6 +/- 16.8%; all p < 0.05; A and B vs C = p < 0.05). BW increased in group A and decreased in the other groups. BP decreased statistically in group B. HDL-cholesterol increased (1.26 +/- 0.46 vs 1.49 +/- 0.36 mmol/L; p < 0.05) and triglyceride levels decreased (1.68 +/- 0.85 vs 1.16 +/- 0.43 mmol/L; p < 0.05) in group A. There were no significant changes in the other studied parameters. We conclude that, for Type 2 diabetic patients given SFS, both insulin and metformin plus SFS provided better glycaemic control than acarbose plus SFS. Metformin combined with SFS offered further advantages for the control of BW and BP.",E,E

After initial diet therapy, 4209 asymptomatic patients who remained hyperglycemic (fasting plasma glucose levels, 6.0 to 15.0 mmol/L) were assigned to either a conventional therapy policy, primarily with diet alone, or to an intensive therapy policy, aiming for fasting plasma glucose levels of less than 6.0 mmol/L, with assignment to primary therapy with sulfonylurea or insulin (which increased insulin supply) or metformin (which enhanced insulin sensitivity).; All three modes of pharmacologic therapy in the intensively treated group-sulfonylurea, insulin, and metformin-had similar efficacy in reducing the fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. Over 9 years, patients assigned to intensive therapy with sulfonylurea or insulin had lower fasting plasma glucose levels (median, 7.3 and 9.0 mmol/L, respectively) than patients assigned to conventional therapy. Regardless of the assigned therapy, however, the fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels increased, and maintaining near-normal glycemia was, in general, not feasible. Even insulin therapy did not achieve the therapeutic goal of near-normal glycemia because of the difficulty in treating marked hyperglycemia and the risk for hypoglycemic episodes. Nine years after the diagnosis of diabetes, 29% of the patients had had a diabetes-related clinical end point, 20% had had a macrovascular complication, and 9% had had a microvascular complication.; A report will be published in 1998 after a median duration from randomization of 11 years (range, 6 to 20 years) with an 81% power at a 1% level of significance of detecting whether the obtained improvement in glucose control causes a 15% decrease or increase in the incidence of major complications and whether any specific therapy is advantageous or disadvantageous.",I,I

All patients were treated by oral hypoglycaemic agents which continued throughout the study. After baseline observations, treatment periods lasted 4 months and were separated by a 30-day wash-out period.; Patients' antropometric data were unchanged throughout the study.

To investigate whether sulfonylurea (SU) affects the secretion of incretin, the modulation of plasma GIP and tGLP-1 levels following glucose ingestion in non-insulin-dependent diabetic type 2 patients with or without SU therapy was studied. A 75-G oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was carried out on 9 healthy subjects (controls) and 18 patients with non-obese type 2, 9 of whom were treated by diet alone (NIDDM-diet) and the other 9 with SU (glibenclamide 2.5 mg or gliclazide 40 mg) once a day (NIDDM-SU). Plasma GIP was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) with R65 antibody, and GLP-1 was measured by RIA with N-terminal-directed antiserum R1043 (GLP-1NT) and C-terminal-directed antiserum R2337 (GLP-1CT). Following OGTT, plasma glucose, GIP, GLP-1NT, and GLP-1CT in type 2 patients increased more markedly than in controls, despite the lower response of insulin. However, there were no significant differences in plasma levels of these peptides between the NIDDM-diet and NIDDM-SU groups. Therefore, it is unlikely that SU is involved in the high response of GIP and GLP-1s to OGTT in type 2 patients.",E,E

Since biguanides do not increase pancreatic insulin secretion, they are referred to as antihyperglycemic agents, as opposed to hypoglycemic agents. Biguanides reduce hyperglycemia by increasing, insulin sensitivity, decreasing glucose absorption, and inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis. Advantages of metformin include achieving glycemic control without exacerbating weight gain or hyperinsulinemia and beneficially affecting serum cholesterol concentrations. Although metformin has the potential to cause lactic acidosis, the incidence is significantly lower compared with phenformin. Risk factors for lactic acidosis include renal serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and hepatic disease. Metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to surgery and before administration of radiologic intravenous contrast, and in patients with sepsis, severe gastrointestinal disease, trauma, and acute cardiovascular events.",E,E

Ten obese patients with NIDDM were studied before and after 8 weeks of treatment with a weight-maintaining diet in combination with the sulphonylurea gliclazide. Gliclazide treatment was associated with significant reductions in HbA1C (p=0.001) and fasting plasma glucose (p=0.005) as well as enhanced beta-cell responses to an oral glucose load. During euglycaemic, hyperinsulinaemic clamp (2 mU x kg-1 x min-1) in combination with indirect calorimetry, a 35% (p=0.005) increase in whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate, predominantly due to an increased non-oxidative glucose metabolism (p=0.02) was demonstrated in teh gliclazide-treated patients when compared to pre-treatment values. In biopsies obtained from vastus lateralis muscle during insulin infusion, the half-maximal activation of glycogen synthase was achieved at a significantly lower concentration of the allosteric activator glucose 6-phosphate (p=0.01). However, despite significant increases in both insulin-stimulated non-oxidative glucose metabolism and muscle glycogen synthase activation in gliclazide-treated patients no changes were found in levels of glycogen synthase mRNA or immunoreactive protein in muscle.

It differs from the sulfonylureas in that it is does not enhance insulin secretion and normally does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin acts to decrease preprandial and postprandial blood glucose concentrations by increasing skeletal muscle uptake of glucose, decreasing gluconeogenesis, and decreasing absorption of glucose. The addition of metformin to maximum dosages of a sulfonylurea may synergistically improve glucose control. The drug may offer other potential benefits, such as weight loss or minimal weight gain, improved blood flow in patients with peripheral vascular disease, reduction of tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor, and improved lipid profiles. It is relatively safe if taken appropriately. Its most common side effects are gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea, anorexia), metallic taste, and vitamin B12 malabsorption. Lactic acidosis may also occur, but it is rare if metformin is avoided in patients with contraindications to its use. With careful monitoring, the agent may be considered for the initial treatment of obese patients who fail dietary measures, and those whose disease is refractory to maximum dosages of sulfonylureas or who do not tolerate them.",E,E

Thirty-nine mildly obese NIDDM patients (BMI 25.6 +/- 0.5) were randomized after 6 weeks of intensive insulin treatment to either a combination treatment (CT, n = 20) or continued intensive insulin treatment (IT, n = 19). There were no differences between the two groups in age, diabetes duration, BMI, HbA1c, or basal and glucagon stimulated C-peptide. The patients were followed for 1 year and the findings were analysed on an intent to treat basis. Two patients in the CT group were excluded after 2 and 6 months, respectively, due to unacceptably high postprandial glucose values. There was a significant difference in HbA1c between the CT and IT groups at 6 months (8.2 +/- 0.2, n = 19, vs 6.8 +/- 0.4%, n = 19, p < 0.001)), but not at 12 months (7.8 +/- 0.3, n = 18, vs 7.5 +/- 0.4%, n = 19). After the initial intensive insulin treatment, BMI was constant in the CT group but increased significantly at 6 and 12 months in the IT group. We conclude that both treatments are associated with a marked and long-term improvement of glycaemic control. The intensive insulin treatment leads to a more pronounced weight increase which in the long run might have negative effect on overall metabolic control. Therefore, the combination treatment together with intensified education and dietary advice should be regarded as the initial treatment of choice for oral agent failure in moderately obese NIDDM patients.",E,E

The majority of NIDDM patients are treated with sulphonylurea (SU) derivatives. In the 1970's the University Group Diabetes Program concluded that tolbutamide treatment caused increased cardiovascular mortality; the study, which led to curtailment of oral antidiabetic treatment in the USA, was received with scepticism in Europe. Later criticism of its methodology reduced the impact of the study; however, the question of the safety of SU in NIDDM patients with cardiovascular disease has been re-opened in the face of new experimental data. The heart and vascular tissues do have prerequisites for SU action, i.e. SU receptors and ATP-dependent K+ (K+ATP) channels. These channels play an important role in the protection of the myocardium against ischaemia-reperfusion damage, and their closure by SU could lead to amplified ischaemic damage. Here we review evidence from animal and human studies for deleterious SU effects on ischaemia-induced myocardial damage, either by direct action or through diminished cardioprotective preconditioning. Closure of K+ATP channels by SU can lead to reduction of post-infarct arrhythmias; the drug has also been claimed to improve various atherosclerosis risk factors. The evidence for these beneficial effects of SU is also reviewed. We look at the major difficulties that hamper transfer of information from experimental studies to clinical decision-making: a) The affinity of SU for heart K+ATP channels is orders of magnitude lower than for beta-cell channels; is it reasonable to expect in vivo cardiac effects with therapeutic 'pancreatic' SU doses? b) Most studies utilized high doses of acutely administered SU; are effects similar in the chronic steady-state of the SU-treated diabetic patient? c) Convincing SU effects have been demonstrated in acutely induced ischaemia by acutely administering the drug; do such effects persist in the clinical situation of gradually progressive ischaemia? d) Ischaemia and modification of K+ATP channel activity induce complex events, some with opposing effects; what is the net result of SU action, and do different SU derivatives lead to different outcomes? e) In the chronic (and hence clinically relevant) situation, how can direct (deleterious or beneficial) SU effects be separated from beneficial effects mediated by the metabolic action of the drug? Only large prospective clinical studies, making use of advanced technology for assessment of cardiovascular function, can answer these questions. Millions of NIDDM patients are treated with SU derivatives; many are in the age group where cardiovascular risks are extremely high. The question of whether SU derivatives are beneficial or deleterious for these patients must finally be settle unequivocally.",I,I

Baseline evaluation of insulin sensitivity was followed by the random assignment of each patient to either captopril or placebo treatment, according to a crossover double-blind design. Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies were then repeated for all patients after both placebo and captopril treatments. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) levels were assessed before, during, and after each clamp.; Resulting data showed that plasma catecholamine levels increased during baseline euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (NE: +23.6% time 0 vs. time 120 min, P < 0.05; E: +24.8% time 0 vs. time 120 min, P < 0.05). Captopril treatment significantly increased total glucose uptake (from 19.0 +/- 9.0 to 26.8 +/- 10.1 mmol.kg-1.min-1, P < 0.05) and reduced baseline plasma NE (P < 0.001) and E (P < 0.05) levels.

Percentage changes in the ratio of total body glucose uptake to circulating insulin levels and corresponding decrements of baseline plasma E levels after captopril therapy were negatively correlated (r = -0.57, P < 0.05).; The reduction of circulating catecholamines could contribute, at least in part, to the captopril-related amelioration of insulin sensitivity.",E,E

For 8 weeks, they received either acarbose (300 mg/daily) or metformin (1,500 mg/daily) in addition to sulfonylurea in a crossover design using a 3-week washout period between treatments. The efficacy of each drug regimen was assessed by measuring the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting and 2-h postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) levels, cholesterol, triglyceride, and fibrinogen levels before and after 8 weeks of therapy.; The metabolic parameters measured before initiation of either treatment regimen were similar. Mean fasting and 2-h postprandial glucose levels were reduced moderately at the end of 8 weeks of both combination treatments (P < 0.05). Although the fasting and 2-h postprandial plasma insulin and C-peptide and fibrinogen levels at the end of the 8-week treatment periods were lower than those obtained at the beginning of the study, the differences between these values were not statistically significant. Cholesterol levels remained unchanged. Only the 2-h PPBG level in the group using acarbose plus a sulfonylurea was lower than the level achieved by the group using metformin plus a sulfonylurea (8.1 +/- 0.8 vs. 9.8 +/- 1.0 mmol/l, respectively, P < 0.05). The difference between pre- and posttreatment levels of the 2-h PPBG level in both arms of the study were statistically significant (delta-acarbose, 5.3 +/- 0.4 vs. delta-metformin, 2.9 +/- 0.3) (P < 0.05).

In the first protocol (n = 10), a 3-h oral glucose load was performed with and without 2 mg of glipizide given 30 min before glucose ingestion. The total insulin response was 60% greater with than without glipizide (5.9 +/- 0.6 vs 3.7 +/- 0.5 microU/ml; P < 0.001). However, the total C-peptide responses were virtually identical (4.7 +/- 0.5 vs 4.8 +/- 0.4 nmol/l) in both studies. In the second protocol (n = 9), the MCR of insulin was measured during 4-h euglycemic insulin clamps performed with and without glipizide. In the study with glipizide, the subjects ingested 5 mg of glipizide at 120 min. The steady-state plasma insulin concentration during the 4th h, i.e., 1-2 h after glipizide ingestion, was significantly higher than during the 2nd h, i.e., before glipizide ingestion (99 +/- 22 vs 78 +/- 17 microU/ml; P < 0.01). In addition, glucose uptake during the 4th h was greater (8.0 +/- 1.6 vs 6.4 +/- 1.5 mg/kg.min) and the MCR of insulin was reduced (503 +/- 126 vs 621 +/- 176 ml/m2.min; P < 0.01). We conclude that glipizide augments plasma insulin levels both by enhancing its secretion and by decreasing the MCR of insulin.",I,I

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG), and HbA1c were measured at predetermined intervals during the washout period and the 14-week study. Adverse events were tabulated.; At each patient visit, reduction from baseline FPG was greater in each glimepiride group than in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Changes from baseline to endpoint after 1, 4, and 8 mg glimepiride exceeded those after placebo (P < 0.001) by 2.4, 3.9, and 4.1 mmol/l, respectively, for FPG; by 1.2, 1.8, and 1.9 percentage points, respectively, for HbA1c; and by 3.5, 5.1, and 5.2 mmol/l, respectively, for 2-h PPG. Greater reductions in these parameters were observed with 8 and 4 mg than with 1 mg (P < 0.05), indicating a dose-response relationship.

In human experiments, GLP-I (0.75 pmol. kg-1.min-1) was given as a continuous infusion during 240 min, while glibenclamide (3.5 mg) was administered orally. Eight patients participated in the study (age 57.6 +/- 2.7 years, BMI 28.7 +/- 1.5 kg/m2, mean +/- SE). In all subjects, blood glucose was first normalized by insulin infusion administered by an artificial pancreas (Biostator).; GLP-I increased the insulinotropic effect of glibenclamide fourfold in the perfused rat pancreas.

Hyperglucagonemia was not ameliorated, and amylin secretion was not altered after glipizide GITS treatment. Placebo-treated patients did not show significant changes in any of the parameters measured.; Glipizide GITS treatment failed to ameliorate the hyperglucagonemia of NIDDM and did not alter amylin secretion even though it increased insulin secretion and significantly ameliorated the hyperglycemia.

Ten men with Type 1 diabetes mellitus participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, clinical trial with three treatment regimens, namely (1) insulin alone, (2) insulin and placebo, (3) insulin and glibenclamide, each lasting 3 months. Combination therapy induced: (1) reduction in daily insulin dosage; (2) more uniform blood glucose control as reflected by a lower average 24 h blood glucose level, a smaller difference between mean preprandial and 2 h postprandial blood glucose concentrations, decreased 24 h urine glucose excretion, and a decline in number of hypoglycaemic events; (3) improved insulin sensitivity as expressed by more rapid plasma glucose disappearance rate, without a significant alteration in fasting plasma glucagon and 1h postprandial serum C-peptide levels; when compared with treatment with either insulin alone or with insulin and placebo. Therefore, it is apparent that the addition of glibenclamide to insulin reduces daily insulin dosage and renders a greater uniformity to diurnal blood glucose control, most probably secondary to enhancement of insulin sensitivity.",E,E

However, obese subjects exhibited higher fasting insulin (114.0 +/- 69 vs. 68.8 +/- 52 pM) at week 12 evaluation and C-peptide concentrations (0.83 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.63 +/- 0.2 nM) after SD as compared to the nonobese group. A smaller percentage increase in C peptide in response to Sustacal challenge was observed in the obese compared to the nonobese subjects (baseline, 60 +/- 25 vs. 117 +/- 117; SD, 119 +/- 39 vs. 193 +/- 149; and CD, 97 +/- 56 vs. 163 +/- 67%). In summary, the influence of obesity on glipizide pharmacokinetics appeared to be of little clinical significance. The observed differences in pharmacodynamics require further evaluation.",I,I

Of the 3 groups of drugs currently available for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the sulphonylureas and metformin are, in general, well-tolerated and generally safe. In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, however, care must be exercised in the use of many of these drugs, as accumulation, either of the active drug or of active metabolites, can lead to serious adverse effects such as hypoglycaemia or, with metformin, lactic acidosis. The sulphonylurea drugs, to a greater or lesser degree, are metabolised in the liver to a variety of active or inactive compounds which, in general, are excreted by the kidneys. In addition, varying amounts of parent compound may depend on renal elimination. As a result, sulphonylurea drugs such as tolazamide, acetohexamide, chlorpropamide and glibenclamide (glyburide) are more likely to cause significant hypoglycaemia, as the metabolism of these drugs, compared with other commonly prescribed sulphonylureas, can lead to the accumulation of either the parent drug or the active metabolite in the presence of renal insufficiency. Tolbutamide, glipizide, gliclazide and gliquidone are much less likely to cause hypoglycaemia as their metabolites are either inactive or have minimal hypoglycaemic potency. Metformin is dependent on renal excretion and is not significantly metabolised. As a result, caution is required when treating patients with renal insufficiency where metformin accumulation can occur, with the danger of lactic acidosis. Although the correlation between creatinine clearance (CLCR) and total oral clearance of drug is weaker than the correlation between CLCR and renal clearance (CLR) of metformin, it is clear that renal insufficiency is associated with most cases of metformin-induced lactic acidosis. For this reason, clinicians in general would regard a raised plasma creatinine as a contraindication to metformin treatment. Acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, and a relatively new agent for treating NIDDM, is likely to be safe in patients with impaired renal function, as the drug is not significantly absorbed from the gut, but data on this subject are lacking.",I,I

After baseline oral (OGTT) and intravenous (IVGTT) glucose tolerance testing, subjects were assigned to take placebo or 200 or 400 mg troglitazone daily for 12 weeks (14 subjects per treatment group). An OGTT and IVGTT were repeated during the 12th week of treatment. Five subjects failed to complete the trial for personal reasons, and medication compliance averaged 90% in the remaining subjects, none of whom experienced a serious adverse event. SI, calculated by minimal model analysis of IVGTT results, changed by only 4 +/- 14% during 12 weeks of placebo administration, but increased 40 +/- 22 and 88 +/- 22% above basal during treatment with 200 and 400 mg troglitazone, respectively (P = 0.01 among groups). Troglitazone administration was also associated with a dose-dependent reduction in the total insulin area during IVGTTs, which was highly significant (P < 0.001), and with a reduction during OGTTs, which approached statistical significance (P = 0.09). Glucose tolerance improved slightly in all groups, but the magnitude of change did not differ significantly among groups, whether it was assessed as the number of subjects who continued to manifest IGT at 12 weeks (P = 0.64 among groups), the change in total glucose area during OGTTs (P = 0.58), or the change in fractional glucose disappearance rates during IVGTTs (P = 0.28). Among the women who received troglitazone, the greatest improvement in SI occurred in the women who had the highest diastolic blood pressures and the best IVGTT insulin responses during baseline testing. Our findings indicate that troglitazone improved whole-body insulin sensitivity and lowered circulating insulin concentrations in women with prior GDM who are at very high risk for NIDDM. The lack of improvement in glucose tolerance despite improved insulin sensitivity may be a manifestation of the beta-cell defect that predisposes the women to NIDDM. The overall pattern of response to troglitazone in our high-risk patients indicates that the drug is an ideal agent with which to test whether the amelioration of insulin resistance can delay or prevent diabetes in women with limited beta-cell reserve.",E,E

The present study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of therapy with second-generation sulfonylurea in subjects with NIDDM following secondary failure to first-generation agents.; The study included 55 subjects with NIDDM who manifested secondary failure to first-generation sulfonylurea therapy. Of these, 29 subjects underwent therapy with the second-generation sulfonylurea glipizide, and 26 subjects were treated with glyburide, both drugs administered in the maximum daily dosage. Before initiation of the second-generation sulfonylurea agents and again at the end of 6 months, metabolic control was assessed by determination of fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the lipid profile.; Fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels were 209 +/- 31 mg/dL and 12.3 +/- 2.1%, respectively, before initiation of glipizide, and did not significantly change following therapy (fasting plasma glucose, 211 +/- 34 mg/dL; HbA1c, 11.7 +/- 1.8%). Similarly, no significant alteration was noted in these metabolic values in the glyburide group (before glyburide therapy, fasting plasma glucose, 180 +/- 16 mg/dL; HbA1c, 11.2 +/- 1.6%; after glyburide therapy, fasting plasma glucose, 184 +/- 20 mg/dL; HbA1c, 11.0 +/- 1.5%).

Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed using compartmental population analysis techniques. Glipizide pharmacodynamic evaluation was assessed by serum glucose, insulin, and C-peptide responses during a 4-hour Sustacal tolerance test performed at baseline before instituting glipizide therapy, with the first 5-mg dose, and at week 12 of therapy. Glipizide dosages were titrated to a targeted goal of fasting plasma glucose of 7.8 mmol/L or less or to reach maximum daily doses of 40 mg.; No significant differences in time to peak concentration, apparent volumes of distribution for the central and peripheral compartments, apparent oral clearance from the central compartment, distributional clearance between the central and peripheral compartments, or terminal elimination half-life were observed with a single dose and long-term dosing. The mean +/- SD terminal elimination half-lives were 9.67 +/- 5.6 and 9.35 +/- 4.6 hours after a single dose and 12 weeks, respectively. Fasting plasma glucose concentrations decreased from 12.3 +/- 3.6 mmol/L before the first dose of glipizide to 9.2 +/- 1.7 mmol/L after 12 weeks of treatment. The values for area under the serum concentration-time curve from zero to 4 hours for glucose (AUC0-4.glucose) were significantly reduced at week 12 (baseline 49.8 +/- 15.6, week 12 37.8 +/- 9.8 mmol/L/hr).

It inhibits alpha-glucosidases in the small intestine, an action that delays the digestion and absorption of complex carbohydrates. Subsequently, there is a smaller rise in the postprandial plasma glucose levels and an overall decrease in the glycosylated hemoglobin by 0.5-1.0%. Potential advantages of acarbose include a greater effectiveness in controlling postprandial hyperglycemia, a low risk of hypoglycemia, and a possible delay in initiating insulin therapy. Acarbose can potentiate the hypoglycemic effects of sulfonylureas or insulin. It has not been associated with weight gain and hyperinsulinemia, both of which can occur with sulfonylureas or insulin. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are common with acarbose, and may decrease with continued treatment. Although rare, elevated serum transaminase levels have been reported.",E,E

We had previously confirmed that the subjects had secondary failure to high doses of sulfonylureas. The initial metformin dosage was a single 850 mg tablet, and the dosage was increased to two or three tablets depending on the patient's metabolic changes. The initial dosage of DNA-recombinant insulin was 24 U, subcutaneously administered and divided into two portions: two-thirds at around 8:00 A.M., before breakfast, and the remaining third at 8:00 P.M., before dinner. The dosage was adjusted based on the patient's clinical and metabolic response.; The initial average glucose value for the metformin group was 269.1 +/- 32.2 mg/dl, decreasing by the end of the study to 159.7 +/- 30.5 mg/dl. For the insulin group, these figures went from 270.7 +/- 24.0 mg/dl at the beginning of the study to 134.8 +/- 26.7 mg/dl. This decrease correlates with the reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin from 12.8 to 8.9% for the first group and from 12.3 to 8.2% for the second, as well as with the reduction in triglyceride values from 230.3 to 183.1 mg/dl and from 218.4 to 186.3 mg/dl, respectively.

Preliminary trials and unpublished reports were not reviewed.; Acarbose is effective in reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. It does not stimulate endogenous insulin secretion and, therefore, will not cause hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy. The enhanced glycemic control achieved with acarbose is additive to that of sulfonylureas. It lowers postprandial serum glucose and insulin concentrations and does not promote weight gain. Acarbose can be used as first-line therapy with diet and exercise, or it can be used in combination with sulfonylureas to lower hemoglobin A1c concentrations an additional 0.5-0.9%. Acarbose is not a cure for diabetes, nor is it a substitute for diet, exercise, oral hypoglycemic agents, or insulin. Adverse effects are gastrointestinal and can be diminished by starting with an initial dosage of 25 mg tid. Depending on patient response, the dosage can be increased up to a maximum of 100 mg tid over time.; Acarbose, through its unique mechanism of action, appears to be a safe and effective adjunctive agent to diet/exercise therapy or sulfonylurea therapy for treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.",E,E

Three insulin administration regimens were compared during a 6-month period: patients were randomized for treatment with a two-injection scheme (regimen A) or a combination of glibenclamide with one injection of NPH insulin, administered either at bedtime (regimen B) or before breakfast (regimen C), and insulin treatment was mainly instituted in an outpatient setting.; After 6 months of insulin treatment, fasting blood glucose of the total patient population had decreased from an average of 14.1 +/- 2.2 to 8.3 +/- 2.0 mmol/L (P < 0.001), and HbA1c fell from 11.0 +/- 1.3 to 8.3 +/- 1.2% (P < 0.001); 34 patients reached HbA1c levels below 8.0%, 25 of them even below 7.5%.

Comparable improvement of the other measures of glycemic control, lipids and lipoproteins, was observed in the different treatment regimens. Body weight increase was moderate (mean +/- 4.0 kg) and similar in all patient groups. One-third of patients starting with one insulin injection daily needed a second injection to control glycemia. One episode of severe hypoglycemia was observed. Combined insulin-sulfonylurea treatment was almost 20% more expensive than twice-daily administration of insulin alone.; Insulin treatment can safely be instituted in elderly patients with NIDDM. However, it is difficult to obtain optimal glycemic control. Insulin has moderate beneficial effects on serum lipoproteins. Although on the basis of glycemic control and weight gain, no preference for any treatment regimen can be discerned, twice-daily insulin administration is the most simple and cost-effective regimen.",E,E

The major goals of treatment are to optimise blood glucose control, and normalise the associated lipid disturbances and elevated blood pressure. Pharmacologic treatment is often necessary. This paper discusses new forms of oral treatment for subjects with type 2 diabetes. These include a new sulphonylurea compound glimepiride (Amaryl), which binds to a different protein of the putative sulphonylurea receptor than glibenclamide, and seems to have a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. A new class of drugs with insulin secretory capacity, of which repaglinide (NovoNorm) is the leading compound, is now in phase III clinical trials. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors reversibly inhibit alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the small intestine, which delays cleavage of oligo- and disaccharides to monosaccharides. This leads to a delayed and reduced blood glucose rise after a meal. Two compounds are in development or have been marketed, ie, miglitol and acarbose (Glucobay). Another new class of drugs is the thiazolidine-diones, which seem to work by enhancing insulin action. The 'insulin sensitising' effects of the leading compounds, troglitazone and BRL 49653C, do not involve any effect on insulin secretion. These drugs also seem to beneficially influence serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Oral antihyperglycaemic agents can be used only during a limited period of time in most patients, after which the diabetic state 'worsens' and insulin therapy has to be started. In this light, two new forms of treatment which require subcutaneous injections are also discussed: the synthetic human amylin analogue AC137 (pramlintide) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36)-amide, a strong glucose-dependent stimulator of insulin secretion. It remains to be seen whether these compounds can be developed further for clinical use in patients with diabetes.",E,E

Patients were divided into three groups with creatinine clearance above 50 ml/min, 20-50 ml/min and under 20 ml/min. Fifteen fasting patients received a single dose of 3 mg glimepiride and serial blood and urine samples were taken over 24 h for pharmacokinetic and efficacy analyses. A further 16 patients received glimepiride over a 3-month period, an initial dose of 1 mg glimepiride being adjusted within the range 1 to 8 mg to achieve good glucose control. Pharmacokinetic evaluation was done on day 1 and after 3 months. Mean relative total clearance and mean volume of distribution of both single (41.6 ml/ min and 8.47 litres, respectively, when creatinine clearance was above 50 ml/min) and multiple doses of glimepiride increased in proportion to the degree of renal impairment (to 91.1 ml/min and 14.98 litres, respectively, when creatinine clearance was below 20 ml/min, single dose), whereas the terminal halflife and mean time remained unchanged. Lower relative total clearance and renal clearance of both glimepiride metabolites correlated significantly with lower creatinine clearance values. Of the 16 patients 12 required between 1 and 4 mg glimepiride to stabilize their fasting blood glucose. Glimepiride was well-tolerated and there were no drug-related adverse events. In conclusion glimepiride is safe, effective and has clearly-definable pharmacokinetics in diabetic patients with renal impairment. The increased plasma elimination of glimepiride with decreasing kidney function is explainable on the basis of altered protein binding with an increase in unbound drug.",I,I

Mean HbAlc levels increased during the study in the patients allocated to glibenclamide treatment, and 11 of 18 patients had to be switched to insulin treatment due to increasing hyperglycaemia (HbAlc > 10%). Mean body weight increased in the subjects allocated to insulin by 7.2 +/- 4.1 kg during the study period. In conclusion, insulin was more effective than glibenclamide treatment in obtaining control over hyperglycaemia in these patients, and once improved, glycaemic control did not deteriorate over 42 months in the insulin-treated group. Two thirds of the patients allocated to glibenclamide treatment had to be given insulin due to inadequate glycaemic control.",I,I

In this study we compared in NIDDM patients with secondary failure to glyburide, the effect of adding a single, low-dose bed time either NPH or ultralent insulin injection (0.15-0.2 U/kg) to the previously ineffective sulfonylurea treatment. Both NPH and ultralent insulin therapy have been demonstrated to be effective in ameliorating metabolic control in NIDDM patients with secondary failure to sulfonylureas. However, the addition of bed-time ultralent insulin caused a greater and significant decrease in post prandial plasma glucose. In contrast, the average fasting plasma glucose decrease was significantly greater after NPH insulin administration. These results indicate that in NIDDM patients with secondary failure to glyburide bed-time ultralent insulin administration is a better tool to improve the post prandial plasma glucose.",2,E

We studied the effect of a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) associated with a low-calorie diet and metformin 1,700 mg/day on glycaemic control and basal and stimulated insulin secretion in a series of 82 overweight NIDD before (T1), during CSII (T2), and after CSII withdrawal (T3). Patients were treated for 8 to 23 days with a mean amount of 0.50 +/- 0.02 IU/kg/day. Glycaemic control was very good after 3-5 days of CSII and remained good at T3. At T2, fasting and postprandial plasma C peptide levels decreased significantly. At T3, fasting C peptide was very similar to T1, and postprandial C peptide was significantly higher than at T1. The molar fasting and postprandial plasma C peptide/glycaemia ratios increased significantly at T3. After glucagon injection, the molar delta C peptide/glycaemia ratio was significantly increased at T2 and even higher at T3. At T2, as at T1 and T3, there were significant correlations between fasting and postprandial C peptide levels and between the glucagon-induced C peptide peak and fasting and postprandial C peptide levels. Between T1 and T3 weight changes correlated significantly with the molar fasting C peptide/glycaemia ratio at T1. Twenty-nine of the 30 patients for whom this ratio was > 6.6 x 10(-8) lost weight. The length of CSII treatment did not correlate with weight changes or other biological parameters. This study shows that CSII with moderate amounts of insulin associated with a low-calorie diet and metformin provided rapid glycaemic control, led to weight loss, maintained regulation of insulin secretion and seemed to improve insulin secretion and sensitivity. These results were obtained in only 8 to 10 days.",E,E

There was a small but statistically significant decrease (16%) in the clearance of tolbutamide in patients receiving the maximum recommended dosage of sertraline. The terminal elimination rate constant was also significantly reduced, corresponding to the increase in the terminal elimination half-life (from 6.9 to 8.6 hours). The decrease in clearance was not associated with any significant changes in plasma protein binding or in the apparent volume of distribution of tolbutamide. This suggests that the change in tolbutamide clearance may be due to a slight inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme CYP2C9/10 when sertraline was administered in its maximum recommended dosage. However, the small changes in the volume of distribution and plasma binding of tolbutamide after sertraline treatment indicate that there is a minimal interaction between sertraline and tolbutamide.",E,E

Its purpose was to evaluate the relationship between insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) with regard to metabolic control and diabetic complications. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin for patients treated with insulin was 12.0 +/- 0.15% versus 11.4 +/- 0.14% (p < .03) for OHA. The difference in fasting blood sugar for the insulin-treated group (195.0 +/- 3.5 mg/dl) versus the OHA-treated group (194.0 +/- 2.9 mg/dl) was not statistically significant. Categorical increases in urinary albumin excretion were associated positively within insulin versus OHA therapy (p < .0001). Patients treated with insulin therapy had a higher frequency of peripheral vascular disease (insulin therapy, 14%; OHA therapy, 10%; p < .05); neuropathy (insulin therapy, 55%; OHA therapy, 37%; p < .0001); and retinopathy (insulin therapy, 71%; OHA therapy, 45%; p < .0001). The frequency of cardiovascular disease was equivalent in the two groups (17% versus 13%). In protocols correcting for diabetes duration, glycosylated hemoglobin, and gender in a multivariate model, the use of insulin still was related significantly to increases in urinary albumin excretion (p < .01), retinopathy (p < .0001), and neuropathy (p < .0008). In a subgroup of individuals with diabetes duration > 10 years (n = 211 for insulin treatment, n = 118 for OHA treatment), the frequency of neuropathy still was significantly higher in the insulin group (63% vs 49%; p < .016) as was retinopathy (85% vs 58%; p < .0001). Overt albuminuria also was more significant in the insulin-treated patients (p < .04). In summary, the NIDDM patients treated with insulin had more nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy than did NIDDM patients treated with OHA, independent of duration of diabetes, fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, age, and blood pressure level. These results in NIDDM patients may be due to contributions from worse blood glucose control at an earlier stage in the patients' diabetes and/or the mitogenic, atherogenic, thrombogenic, and vascular permeability effects of insulin.",5,E

The primary objective of the present study was to search for genetic variation in the HNF-1alpha gene in nine nonrelated Danish Caucasian subjects with MODY. Direct sequencing of the coding region and intron-exon boundaries of the HNF-1alpha gene revealed 2 novel and 1 previously reported missense mutations and 2 novel frameshift mutations in five of nine MODY subjects. These five mutations were found in neither 84 NIDDM patients nor 84 control subjects. One glucose-tolerant lean male with a P447L missense mutation, which in his relatives caused MODY, underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a tolbutamide modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, and a glucagon test to examine for a possible early beta-cell abnormality. He had a low insulin secretion rate during an OGTT, but a twofold increase in pancreatic beta-cell response after intravenous glucose and a 2.5- to 4-fold increase in beta-cell response after either intravenous tolbutamide or intravenous glucagon loads. In conclusion, 1) mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene are common in Danish Caucasian MODY patients, and 2) early stages in the pathogenesis of MODY3 caused by the P447L mutation may be characterized by a hyperexcitability of beta-cells to intravenous secretagogues.",E,E

In such patients, we compared the effect of low-dose sulfonylurea and dietary therapy in the prevention of recurrence of hyperglycemia.; We conducted an intention-to-treat study in 35 obese newly diagnosed diabetic patients (17 with DKA and 18 with severe hyperglycemia). After discontinuation of insulin, seven of 17 patients with DKA and seven of 18 patients with hyperglycemia were managed with diet and glyburide (1.25-2.5 mg/day), whereas other patients were followed with diet alone. In all patients, pancreatic insulin reserve was documented 1 day after resolution of hyperglycemic crises and within 1 week of discontinuation of insulin. Recurrence of hyperglycemia was defined as fasting blood glucose > 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) or random blood glucose > 10 mmol/l (180 mg/dl) on two or more consecutive determinations, or HbA1c > 7.5%.; Both treatment groups were comparable in age, sex, duration of diabetes, months of insulin therapy, BMI, glucose, and HbA1c. At presentation, the acute C-peptide response to glucagon in obese DKA patients was lower than in patients with hyperglycemia (P < 0.01), but responses were comparable after discontinuation of insulin. Sulfonylurea treatment significantly reduced recurrence of hyperglycemia in both obese DKA and obese hyperglycemic patients (P = 0.03).

Each clinical trial had a duration of 16 weeks with a 1-week washout, 3-week single-blind placebo phase, 4-week titration to a fixed dose, and 8-week maintenance phase at the assigned dose. In the first trial, once-daily doses of 5, 20, 40, or 60 mg glipizide GITS were compared with placebo in 143 patients. In the second trial, doses of 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg of glipizide GITS were compared with placebo in 204 patients. HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, C-peptide, and glipizide levels were determined at regular intervals throughout the study. Postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), insulin, and C-peptide also were determined at 1 and 2 h after a mixed meal (Sustacal).; All doses of glipizide GITS in both trials produced significant reductions from placebo in FPG (range -57 to -74 mg/dl) and HbA1c (range -1.50 to -1.82%). Pharmacodynamic analysis indicated a significant relationship between plasma glipizide concentration and reduction in FPG and HbA1c over a dose range of 5-60 mg, with maximal efficacy achieved at a dose of 20 mg for FPG and at 5 mg for HbA1c. PPG levels were significantly lower, and both postprandial insulin and C-peptide levels significantly higher in patients treated with glipizide GITS compared with placebo. The percent reduction in FPG was comparable across patients with diverse demographic and clinical characteristics, including those with entry FPG > or = 250 mg/dl, resulting in greater absolute decreases in FPG and HbA1c in patients with the most severe hyperglycemia. Despite the forced titration to a randomly assigned dose, only 11 patients in both studies discontinued therapy because of hypoglycemia. Glipizide GITS did not alter lipids levels or produce weight gain.; The once-daily glipizide GITS 1) lowered HbA1c, FPG, and PPG over a dose range of 5-60 mg, 2) was maximally effective at 5 mg (using HbA1c) or 20 mg (using FPG) based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships, 3) maintained its effectiveness in poorly controlled patients (those with entry FPG > or = 250 mg/dl), 4) was safe and well tolerated in a wide variety of patients with NIDDM, and 5) did not produce weight gain or adversely affect lipids.",I,I

In a single-blinded cross-over design vs. placebo, one 30 mg tablet gliquidone was administered 15 min before breakfast. Concomitant to the measurement of glucose and insulin, the gliquidone plasma levels of 20 subjects were determined by a new specific liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay method with fluorescence detection, and the pharmacokinetic parameters calculated. Following the gliquidone administration, the mean plasma glucose profiles of the responders were up to 15% lower than with placebo (p < 0.005) between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., representing a duration of the blood sugar-lowering effect of 8 to 10 h. Insulin values were raised, with peaks over 40% higher, during or shortly after meals. Subsequently, the insulin levels returned to approximately the same levels obtained with placebo during the postprandial phase. Plasma concentrations of gliquidone showed pronounced interindividual variability. The mean maximum concentration in plasma Cmax was 0.65 microgram/ml, (range: 0.12-2.14 micrograms/ml, coefficient of variation (CV): 82%).

Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent; it lowers the blood glucose concentration without causing hypoglycemia. Proposed mechanisms of action include decreased intestinal absorption of glucose, increased glucose uptake from the blood into the tissues, decreased glucose production in the liver, and decreased insulin requirements for glucose disposal. Metformin is slowly absorbed from the small intestine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism. The half-life is about five hours. The major route of elimination is renal; the drug is contraindicated in patients with impaired renal function. In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, metformin has shown efficacy in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The drug is as effective as sulfonylureas in patients with diabetes who are nonobese or obese and whose diabetes is uncontrolled by diet alone. Metformin may be useful as addon therapy in obese patients with diabetes uncontrolled by sulfonylureas and diet. Lipid profiles may be favorably influenced. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal. A rare but potentially fatal adverse effect is lactic acidosis. Metformin has the potential to interact with cationic drugs eliminated by the renal tubular pathway. The usual effective dosage is 1.5-2.5 g/day orally in two or three divided doses. Metformin hydrochloride is an effective alternative to sulfonylureas in obese and non-obese patients with NIDDM in whom diet alone has not achieved glycemic control, and it may be useful as addon therapy in patients whose diabetes has not responded adequately to sulfonylureas plus dietary measures.",E,E

The goals in the management of NIDDM in elderly people are the prevention of complications and the relief of symptoms. Treatment must be tailored to the individual's expectations and should be reviewed regularly with the changing circumstances of aging. If dietary measures fail to control glucose levels, antihyperglycaemic sulphonylureas are the most frequently prescribed form of treatment. However, concern over the potential of these drugs to cause hypoglycaemia limits the choice to second generation sulphonylureas, agents that preserve the first phase of insulin release and have non-biologically active metabolites that are promptly eliminated. The biguanide agent metformin is also appropriate in elderly obese patients with NIDDM who do not have renal, liver or cardiac failure. The combination of a sulphonylurea and metformin can be effective in patients in whom insulin would otherwise be required. Novel compounds such as acarbose and the thiazolinediones may also be useful in the treatment of older diabetic patients.",E,E

An effect compartment was linked to appropriate pharmacokinetic models and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling was used to fit the pharmacokinetics of Gb by both routes and the metabolites for each individual. Based on the individual concentration-time profiles a PK/PD-model was applied to all effect data simultaneously. An increase in the steady-state serum concentration when the effect is 50% of maximal, CEss50, was found in the sequence M1 (23 ng ml-1), M2 (37 ng ml-1) and Gb (108 ng ml-1). Corresponding interindividual variabilities expressed as CV% were 25%, 47% and 26%. The elimination rate constants from the effect site (kEO) were estimated and increased in the order M1 (0.178 h-1, CV 13%), M2 (0.479 h-1, CV 8.5%) and Gb (1.59 h-1, CV 36%). Corresponding equilibration half-lives for the effect site (kEO-HL) were 3.9 h, 1.4 h and 0.44 h. Estimated Emax-values obtained for M1, M2 and Gb were 40% (CV 30%), 27% (CV 56%) and 56% (CV 14%), respectively.; It is concluded that the two major metabolites of Gb are hypoglycaemic in man, that they may have higher activity at low concentrations and that they may have a longer effect duration than the parent drug.",E,E

In contrast to sulfonylureas, metformin does not stimulate insulin-secretion, promote weight gain, exacerbate hyperinsulinemia, or cause hypoglycemia. It also favorably affects serum lipids.; A comprehensive review of the medical literature from 1968 to the present was conducted using the key words ""metformin"" and ""non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.""; Metformin monotherapy was superior to placebo and comparable to sulfonylureas in reducing fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in patients with NIDDM uncontrolled by diet. Metformin and sulfonylureas, however, had diverse effects on body weight and fasting plasma insulin levels; both weight and insulin levels remained unchanged or decreased with metformin and increased with sulfonylureas. In patients with secondary sulfonylurea failure, the combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea synergistically improved glycemic control better than either drug alone and was comparable to insulin plus sulfonylurea. When hyperglycemia is uncontrolled by insulin after secondary sulfonylurea failure, limited data suggest the efficacy of metformin plus insulin. The mild, transient, self-limited gastrointestinal side effects that sometimes occur can be minimized by gradually increasing the doses and by taking metformin with food. Risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is low if prescribing guidelines are adhered to. Potential adverse drug interactions include hypoglycemia during concurrent sulfonylurea therapy and elevated metformin plasma concentrations when metformin is taken concomitantly with cimetidine.; Metformin can be used safely and effectively as first-line monotherapy in NIDDM or in combination with a sulfonylurea when monotherapy with either agent fails. It can be particularly suitable when weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and hypoglycemia are clinically important issues.",E,E

Two hundred and ninety-one patients with Type 2 diabetes (age 21-81 years) whose previous glycaemic control by sulphonylureas was judged stable but unsatisfactory (fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 8.3 mmol I-1) were randomly allocated into the troglitazone treatment group (troglitazone group, n = 145) or the placebo treatment group (placebo group, n = 146). They were treated by test drugs for 12 weeks in combination with the same dose of sulphonylureas before the trial. One hundred and twenty-two patients who received troglitazone and 126 patients who received placebo were evaluated for efficacy. The baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the two groups. In the troglitazone group, FPG and HbA(1c) decreased significantly after the treatment (before vs after, FPG: 10.8 +/- 2.0 mmol I(-1) vs 9.2 +/- 2.5 mmol I(-1), p< 0.001; HbA(1c): 9.2 +/- 1.4% vs 8.5 +/- 1.5%, p< 0.001). FPG and HbA(1c) did not change after the treatment in the placebo group (before vs after, FPG: 10.5 +/- 1.7 mmol I(-1) vs 10.7 +/- 2.2 mmol I(-1); HbA(1c): 9.0 +/- 1.5% vs 9.2 +/- 1.6 %). Serum total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol did not change in either group, however, serum triglyceride significantly decreased in the troglitazone group. No serious adverse events occurred in either group. In conclusion, troglitazone 400 mg day(-1) had a significant hypoglycaemic effect in combination with sulphonylureas without any serious adverse events. Troglitazone, developed as an insulin action enhancer, can be a useful hypoglycaemic agent in the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes who are not well controlled by sulphonylureas alone.",E,E

Subjects were randomized into two groups. For 4 weeks, group 1 received glimepiride 3 mg twice daily, and group 2 received glimepiride 6 mg once daily. After a 3-week placebo-washout period, twice- and once-daily regimens were crossed over for a second 4-week treatment period. Subjects were hospitalized at the end of each placebo or active-treatment phase. Their glucose concentrations were recorded at 20 time points over a 24-hour period, and their insulin and C-peptide concentrations were recorded at 16 time points over the same period. Parameters that were calculated included fasting, 24-hour, and postprandial concentrations of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide.; One hundred six patients were randomized to receive treatment; 94 completed the entire study. Existing physiologic mechanisms of glucose control were apparently unimpaired by glimepiride treatment. Insulin concentrations increased more during the postprandial glucose peaks than when subjects were fasting. Both twice- and once-daily regimens proved equally effective in reducing concentrations of fasting, postbreakfast, postlunch, and postdinner plasma glucose. Twenty-four-hour mean glucose concentrations showed a slightly greater decrease from baseline for the twice-daily regimen; the difference between the regimens was statistically significant but not clinically meaningful. The incidence of adverse events with glimepiride approximated that obtained with placebo, with both groups reporting only one adverse event, headache, in more than 5% of the subjects.; Glimepiride is equally effective whether administered once or twice daily. Glimepiride seems to stimulate insulin production primarily after meals, when plasma glucose concentrations are highest, but controls blood glucose throughout the day.",I,I

Twelve patients with NIDDM and secondary failure were studied on oral agents and then switched to insulin treatment. Fasting and postprandial IAPP concentrations were measured on oral treatment and on insulin treatment. In 5 of the patients no postprandial concentrations were determined. In the 7 patients who were investigated both fasting and postprandially the fasting IAPP concentration was 6.5 +/- 1.2 pmol l(-1) (mean +/- SEM) during oral treatment with a rise to 13.5 +/- 3.1 90 min after breakfast (p = 0.028). On insulin treatment HbA1c decreased from 8.6 +/- 0.5 to 7.5 +/- 0.4% (p< 0.03) and plasma C-peptide concentration was significantly lowered (p< 0.01). There was a close correlation using simple regression between the per cent change of IAPP concentration and the per cent change of C-peptide concentration during this period (r = 0.88; p< 0.01). In the total patient material of 12 patients there was a significant correlation using simple regression analysis between per cent change of IAPP concentration and per cent change of C-peptide concentration using all 48 measurements available (r = 0.58: p< 0.001). These data suggest that secretion of IAPP is lowered when endogenous insulin secretion is lowered by administration of exogenous insulin in patients with NIDDM. Thus, if IAPP secretion has a pathogenetic role in the development of beta cell failure in NIDDM, insulin treatment might delay this deterioration.",E,E

All patients were on stable treatment with a second generation sulphonylurea for at least 8 weeks prior to randomization and received placebo (P) or 5 mg glimepiride (G) daily for 7 days and 10 mg prior to a hyperglycaemic clamp (10.9 mmol l(-1) for 60 min, preceded by i.v. insulin infusion to stabilize fasting blood glucose levels at 4.0 mmol l(-1)). The clamp was followed by an observation period of 2 h in 5 subjects and 3.5 h in the next 9 subjects, during which blood glucose and plasma insulin, C-peptide and proinsulin levels were measured at regular intervals to determine the effect of glimepiride on the interaction between changes in glycaemia and plasma levels of beta cell products. Neither G nor P elicited a first phase insulin response. Areas under plasma insulin curve during the 1 h hyperglycaemic clamp were 94.2 (39.5) vs 69.1 (26.5) pmol.h l(-1) in G and P clamps, respectively (p = 0.002).

Total AUCs of C-peptide were 309 (96) and 259 (102 pmol.h.(-1), in G and P clamps, respectively, p = 0.01. Total AUCs of proinsulin were 176 (77) versus 119 (56) pmol.h l(-1) in G and P clamps, respectively, p = 0.004.

Troglitazone, an insulin sensitizing agent, reduces glucose concentrations in subjects with NIDDM and IGT but is not known to affect insulin secretion. We sought to determine the role of beta cell function in mediating improved glucose tolerance. Obese subjects with IGT received 12 wk of either 400 mg daily of troglitazone (n = 14) or placebo (n = 7) in a randomized, double-blind design. Study measures at baseline and after treatment were glucose and insulin responses to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, insulin sensitivity index (SI) assessed by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, insulin secretion rates during a graded glucose infusion, and beta cell glucose-sensing ability during an oscillatory glucose infusion. Troglitazone reduced integrated glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose by 10% (P = 0.03) and 39% (P = 0.003), respectively. SI increased from 1.3+/-0.3 to 2.6+/-0.4 x 10(-)5min-1pM-1 (P = 0.005). Average insulin secretion rates adjusted for SI over the glucose interval 5-11 mmol/liter were increased by 52% (P = 0.02), and the ability of the beta cell to entrain to an exogenous oscillatory glucose infusion, as evaluated by analysis of spectral power, was improved by 49% (P = 0.04). No significant changes in these parameters were demonstrated in the placebo group. In addition to increasing insulin sensitivity, we demonstrate that troglitazone improves the reduced beta cell response to glucose characteristic of subjects with IGT.

Although short-term infusion of insulin during the hyperinsulinemiceuglycemic clamp does not increase leptin concentration, the effect of oral antidiabetic agents on leptin concentration is unknown. Differing effects can be expected, since glibenclamide acts via stimulation of insulin secretion, whereas acarbose inhibits alpha-glucosidases of the small intestine and has no direct effect on insulin levels. We examined the effect of acarbose (n = 4), glibenclamide (n = 6), and placebo (n = 6) on insulin and leptin levels during 24-h periods before and after 16 weeks of therapy.; We observed a significant diurnal variation in leptin concentrations. This was inversely related to insulin levels during the 24-h follow-up with usual diet. Neither the placebo nor acarbose altered leptin concentrations.

Type 2 diabetes is preceded by a long period of impaired glucose tolerance, a reversible metabolic state associated with increased prevalence of macrovascular complications. Thus, at the time of diagnosis, long-term complications have developed in almost one fourth of patients. Susceptibility to type 2 diabetes requires genetic (most likely polygenic) and acquired factors, and its pathogenesis involves an interplay of progressive insulin resistance and beta-cell failure. The ideal treatment of type 2 diabetes should reverse insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in most treated patients and prevent, delay, or reverse long-term complications. Current strategies are aimed at amelioration of insulin resistance (diet, exercise, weight loss, and metformin and troglitazone therapy), augmentation of insulin supply (sulfonylurea and insulin therapy), or limitation of postprandial hyperglycemia (acarbose therapy). Future therapies probably will target (1) insulin resistance, using a multifaceted approach; (2) hepatic glucose production, using gluconeogenesis inhibitors; (3) excess nonesterified fatty acid production, using lipolysis inhibitors; and (4) fat oxidation, using carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and II inhibitors. Attempts also could be made to stimulate energy expenditure and increase nonoxidative glucose disposal by means of beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists. One promising strategy is an attack on multiple pathophysiological processes by combining antidiabetic agents with disparate mechanisms of action. Thus, we now have unprecedented resources for drug therapy for diabetes, with great opportunity for innovative combinations. It is hoped that these expanded choices will provide the tools necessary for a more efficient management of type 2 diabetes and prevention of its long-term complications.",E,E

However, this schedule does not seek low blood glucose values, especially in the evening. We have conducted a prospective study of laboratory blood glucose profiles (8 am, 9.30 am after a 35 g carbohydrate breakfast and in the evening between 5 and 7 pm). We have included 58 consecutive NIDDM patients regularly followed in our clinic (39 men, age 60 +/- 11.5 years, diabetes duration 8.6 +/- 6.5 years, BMI 25.5 +/- 3 kg m-2), treated with the sulphonylurea gliclazide, alone (40-320 mg 24 h-1, mean 170 +/- 110 mg) (group 1, n = 32) or in combination with metformin (1000-3000 mg 24 h-1, 2400 +/- 620 mg) (group 2, n = 26). All patients were stable, with no change in dosage for at least 3 months. Mean glycaemic control was good (group 1 HbA1c: 6.5 +/- 1.1%, group 2: 6.9 +/- 0.7%). Evening blood glucose values were the lowest of the day in 26 patients of group 1 (81.3%) and in 22 of group 2 (84.6%). Mean evening blood glucose levels were lower (p = 0.001) than 8 am values (group 1: 5.8 +/- 1.4 vs 6.1 +/- 1.6 mmol l-1, group 2: 6.5 +/- 1.8 vs 6.9 +/- 1.9) and than 9.30 am values (group 1: 7.6 +/- 1.5, group 2: 12.3 +/- 2.8). No blood glucose values in the hypoglycaemic range were observed. HbA1c was strongly correlated (p = 0.002 to 0.0001) in the whole group with 8 am (r = 0.39), 9.30 am (r = 0.56), and evening blood glucose values (r = 0.42). These results indicate that, in patients treated with the sulphonylurea gliclazide, alone or in combination with metformin, the lowest blood glucose values occur in the evening more frequently (4/5) than in the morning. Therefore, evening blood glucose determination should be performed systematically in the course of the metabolic evaluation of NIDDM patients on oral hypoglycaemic agents.",E,E

It remains uncertain whether this reflects a primary beta-cell defect in proinsulin processing or is secondary to hyperglycemia. We addressed this question by assessing the effects of reducing hyperglycemia on relative hyperproinsulinemia in subjects with NIDDM. Eight subjects with NIDDM underwent three 8-week periods in a randomized crossover design of therapy with diet alone, sulfonylurea (gliclazide), or insulin (ultralente). The effects on beta-cell peptide concentrations were assessed 1) fasting, 2) in response to hyperglycemic clamping, and 3) in response to an injection of the nonglucose secretogogue arginine and compared with measurements in seven nondiabetic control subjects. Both sulfonylurea and insulin therapy substantially reduced fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1e) concentrations, compared with diet therapy alone. The diabetic subjects on diet therapy had relative hyperproinsulinemia, assessed relative to C-peptide concentrations, fasting and in response to hyperglycemic clamping and arginine, compared with control subjects. Neither sulfonylurea nor insulin therapy altered the relative hyperproinsulinemia. Insulin therapy reduced fasting proinsulin concentrations from geometric mean 29.4 (1 SD range, 14.6-59.0) pmol/l on diet therapy to 18.7 (7.3-48.1) pmol/l (P < 0.05). A similar trend was evident with fasting C-peptide concentrations with a reduction from 0.9 (0.6-1.4) nmol/l on diet therapy to 0.6 (0.4-0.9) nmol/l (P = 0.06), so that the relative hyperproinsulinemia, assessed as the ratio of fasting proinsulin to C-peptide, was unchanged by insulin. Similarly, insulin therapy failed to reduce the ratio of proinsulin to C-peptide concentrations in response to a hyperglycemic clamp and in the acute incremental response to arginine. Failure to improve the relative hyperproinsulinemia of NIDDM, despite significant reduction of hyperglycemia with exogenous insulin therapy, supports the hypothesis that relative hyperproinsulinemia in NIDDM is a reflection of a primary beta-cell defect rather than being secondary to hyperglycemia.",3,E

After a 3-week washout period, patients were randomly assigned to 2-month treatment periods (insulin or glibenclamide); thereafter, each patient crossed to the other treatment. At the end of each period, mean daily blood glucose (MDBG), HbA1e, plasma lipids, lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL, HDL), lipoprotein subfractions (VLDL1, 2, 3; HDL2, HDL3), and post-heparin lipase activities (lipoprotein lipase [LPL], hepatic lipase [HL]) were evaluated. Although glucose control was similar at the end of both periods (MDBG 8.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/l; HbA1c 7.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 7.0 +/- 0.2%, insulin versus glibenclamide), insulin compared with glibenclamide induced a significant reduction in plasma triglycerides (0.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, P < 0.05), VLDL triglycerides (50.1 +/- 12.2 vs. 63.6 +/- 12.3 mg/dl, P < 0.02), VLDL1 lipid concentration (24.9 +/- 7.5 vs. 39.9 +/- 9.5 mg/dl, P < 0.006), and increased HDL2 cholesterol (25.2 +/- 1.6 vs. 20.3 +/- 1.3 mg/dl, P < 0.03). In terms of VLDL percentage subfraction distribution, with insulin, there was a decrease in the larger subfractions (VLDL1 26.5 +/- 3.0 vs. 37.8 +/- 3.4%, P < 0.02) and an increase in the smallest (VLDL3 47.3 +/- 3.8 vs. 37.3 +/- 3.3%, P < 0.05). Moreover, HL activity was significantly lower after insulin than after glibenclamide (HL 247.2 +/- 22.3 vs. 263.5 +/- 22.6 mU/ml, P < 0.05). In conclusion, compared with glibenclamide, insulin treatment (independent of variations in glucose control) is able to decrease significantly plasma triglycerides, to increase HDL2 cholesterol, and to reduce only the concentration of the larger VLDL subfractions, with a consequent redistribution of their profile.",3,E
9340472,[Value of biguanide in therapy of diabetes mellitus].,"Biguanides; Blood Glucose; Contraindications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Resistance; Metformin","Haupt, E; Panten, U","Biguanides have been used in treatment of diabetes mellitus for over 30 years now. Due to frequent occurrence of lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with serious contraindications to biguanide therapy and in cases of non-compliance with dosage instructions, buformin and phenformin were taken off the market in most European countries at the end of the seventies. Metformin continued to be allowed, since the risk of lactic acidosis is 20 times less than with phenformin or buformin due to the different pharmacokinetic properties of the substance. Plenty of clinical experience has been gained with metformin, documented in a large number of reliable long-term studies.; Metformin lowers fasting blood glucose levels by an average of 25% (17 to 37%), postprandial blood glucose by up to 44.5% and HbA1c bei 1.5% (0.8 to 3.1%) Metformin reduces raised plasma insulin levels in cases of metabolic syndrome by as much as 30% and reduces the ""insulin requirement"" of type 2 insulin-treated diabetics by 15 to 32%. It has well documented effects on various rheological parameters. In overweight type 2 diabetics, metformin shows the same level of hypoglycaemic effect as all of the important sulfonylurea derivatives used in Europe. The active mechanism of these derivatives is, however, concentrated solely on reduction of blood glucose. This mechanism does not take into account the remaining risk constellation involved in insulin resistance. Biguanides, similarly to weight reduction, lead to a reduction of hyperinsulinaemia, which is by contrast exacerbated by sulfonylureas and, in particular, exogenous insulin.; The risk of lactic acidosis can probably be eliminated entirely if dosage instructions and contraindications are observed carefully. The cause of such neglect in 83% of all cases was limited on renal function (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg%). Regarding morbidity and mortality from lactic acidosis, metformin therapy is no riskier than treatment with the sulfonylurea derivative glibenclamide, taking into account the incidence of fatal hypoglycaemias with the latter.",E,E

Additional blood samples were taken to measure serum glucose on the same day.; The concentration-time course of glibenclamide under concomitant voglibose administration was similar to that under placebo. The equivalence ratio (test/reference) for the pharmacokinetic characteristics AUCnorm was 1.03 (geometric mean; 0.95-1.11, 90% confidence interval) and Cmax.norm 1.01 (0.94-1.08). The parameters were within the accepted range of 0.8-1.25 (AUC) or 0.7-1.43 (Cmax), thus fulfilling equivalence criteria and indicating no effect of voglibose on glibenclamide kinetics. The glibenclamide-induced decrease in fasting serum glucose concentration was similarly independent of placebo or voglibose co-administration.; Voglibose did not interact with glibenclamide on a pharmacokinetic level.

Fasting and 1-h postprandial blood glucose (BG) profiles were undertaken from three groups of patients with diabetes before and after short-term of treatment of lithium carbonate. Group I was treated with diet only, Group II with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA), and Group III with insulin. The fasting blood glucose (FBG) level and 1-h postprandial blood glucose (1-h PBG) level before and after treatment of lithium were: Group I: FBG: 7.67 +/- 0.48 vs 7.13 +/- 0.82; 1-h PBG 15.13 +/- 0.88 vs 10.33 +/- 0.96; Group II: FBG: 8.84 +/- 0.67 vs 6.04 +/- 0.57; 1-h PBG: 12.33 +/- 0.72 vs 9.95 +/- 0.82; Group III: FBG: 10.87 +/- 0.83 vs 6.83 +/- 0.79; 1-h PBG: 12.45 +/- 0.93 vs 9.17 +/- 1.00 mmol/L, respectively. The FBG and PBG of all three groups decreased significantly after lithium treatment, except the FBG in Group I. These data suggest that combined with other therapy, lithium could improve glucose metabolism in most patients with diabetes. Our results suggest that lithium has an assisting hypoglycemic effect on antidiabetic treatment.",E,E

Measurements were made of 1) fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations; 2) glucose appearance and disappearance rates measured overnight with 3-[3H]glucose; and 3) plasma FFA concentrations during a 45-min infusion period at relatively low (approximately 60 pmol/l) insulin concentrations.; Mean +/- SE hourly plasma glucose, insulin, and FFA concentrations were similar before and after treatment in the placebo group. In contrast, mean hourly plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower (P < 0.005) after metformin treatment in both the placebo-controlled and open-label groups (-3.9 +/- 1.0 and -4.4 +/- 0.8 mmol/l, respectively). Similarly, day-long hourly FFA levels were lower (P < 0.005) following metformin in the placebo-controlled and open-label groups (-87 +/- 35 and -136 +/- 31 mumol/l, respectively). Plasma insulin concentrations did not change with treatment in any group. Overnight glucose turnover studies indicated that neither the rate of glucose appearance (hepatic glucose production) or glucose disappearance changed significantly with treatment in the placebo or metformin groups. Because plasma glucose concentration was much lower after metformin treatment, overnight glucose metabolic clearance rate was significantly (P < 0.001) lower in this group. Finally, plasma FFA concentrations in response to a low-dosage insulin infusion (5 mU.m-2.min-1) were significantly lower after metformin as compared with the placebo-treated group (P < 0.001).; Metformin treatment was associated with significantly lower day-long plasma glucose and FFA concentrations. Although overnight hepatic glucose production was unchanged following treatment with metformin, the overnight glucose metabolic clearance rate significantly increased. Given these findings, it is suggested that at least part of the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin is due to an increase in glucose uptake, secondary to a decrease in release of FFA from adipose tissue, and lower circulating FFA concentrations.",E,E

The potency of sulfonamide has increased with the generations. However, this potency is compensated in practice by the dose prescribed, which is much smaller for recent generations. The half-life is a far more important property. The effective action period is correlated with half-life but is much longer. The action period for ""short-term"" sulfonamides is < or = 24 h (tolbutamide, glipizide) and can exceed 24 h for ""long-term"" sulfonamides (e.g. glibenclamide). Metabolism and elimination reduce the risk of accumulation. All sulfonamides are metabolised more than 95% by the liver. The metabolites are inactive except for one from glibenclamide. As a function of their action period and possibly of intrinsic properties, some sulfonamides more than others (e.g. glibenclamide) affect fasting hepatic glucose production, which is particularly increased early in the day in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients because of a circadian drop in insulin sensitivity (dawn phenomenon). Finally, in chronic administration, all sulfonamides cause a progressive desensitisation of the beta cell, which responds by an insulin secretion peak only during food intake. This condition indicates the unuselessness of sulfonamide fractionation and, contrary to the classic notion, the low risk of hypoglycaemia after a meal is skipped. The ideal product would be a sulfonamide with high potency and an ultra-short half-life, but capable of maintaining plasma concentrations for 24 h (which might seem incompatible except in continuous administration). Moreover, it would exert its action at relatively low levels of insulinaemia and be completely metabolisable. Glipizide in its osmotic oral form (Ozidia) satisfies all these conditions since it is a very potent sulfonamide with a quite short half-life but with intestinal delivery up to 16 h after administration because of its osmotic principle. It controls fasting glycaema better than ordinary glipizide and at least as well as glibenclamide by acting on hepatic glucose production. Compared to glibenclamide, it has the advantage of generation this effect at lower levels of insulinaemia. In comparison with normal glipizide, it allows identical control for lower postprandial inslinaemias, which is proof of its powerful inductive effect on insulin sensitivity.",E,E

In vitro, in circulating lymphocytes of untreated patients and controls insulin at 5 microU ml(-1) was ineffective and highly effective, respectively, in raising enzyme activity; gliclazide at 10 ng ml(-1) was ineffective on PDH in both groups, but in combination with insulin at 5 microU ml(-1) in both groups PDH was as active as in cells of controls exposed to insulin only. In cells of controls, gliclazide alone at 25-50 ng ml(-1) caused enzyme activation, whereas above 50 ng ml(-1) it caused inhibition; in cells of patients below 50 ng ml(-1) it had no effects, but at 50 ng ml(-1) and above raised enzyme activity to the basal level of controls.; This study suggests that free gliclazide concentrations determine recovery of PDH activity in circulating lymphocytes of treated patients through drug-mediated enhanced insulin control over PDH or through the drug alone.",E,E

We investigated the long-term effect of picotamide on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) at rest and induced by exercise in 30 type 2 diabetic patients who were normotensive and had microalbuminuria while at rest. The subjects of our study had a mean age of 52.5 +/- 1.6 years, BMI of 28.5 +/- 0.7 kg/m2, diabetes duration of 9.1 +/- 1.8 years, and HbA1c of 7.0 +/- 0.8%. The study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The patients were randomly allocated to receive for 1 year either picotamide, 300 mg, 3 tablets/day, or placebo, 3 tablets/day. The patients were asked to visit our outpatient clinic after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment. At all times, blood pressure, microalbuminuria at rest, blood glucose, serum creatinine, serum picotamide, and creatinine clearance were measured; at baseline and after 6 and 12 months, all patients underwent submaximal physical exercise. After 6 months of picotamide, baseline and exercise-induced microalbuminuria were significantly decreased (up to one-third) as compared with the baseline and placebo level, with no further drops at month 12 of picotamide treatment. On placebo treatment, UAE at rest and after exercise was slightly increased compared with baseline values. The effects of picotamide occurred without significant side effects or changes in either blood pressure levels or glycometabolic control. Our study is the first long-term intervention trial in type 2 diabetes showing that an antithromboxane agent is able to decrease microalbuminuria, which in this disease is a dual marker of macro- and microangiopathy. Our findings suggest an important role for thromboxane in the pathophysiology of microalbuminuria in diabetes; moreover, we hypothesize that antithromboxane agents may have a place in the treatment/prevention of both macro- and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetic patients.",E,E

They stimulate insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. Pharmacokinetic differences between the various sulphonylureas are of clinical importance in terms of the time to onset of action, timing of drug administration in relation to food intake, magnitude and duration of the glucose-lowering effect and the risk of serious hypoglycaemia. Recent studies with improved analytical sensitivity have shown that the elimination half-life of glibenclamide is longer than previously thought and that 2 metabolites of glibenclamide have significant hypoglycaemic activity. Furthermore, single dose studies in healthy volunteers using an integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model have identified clear concentration-effect relationships for both glibenclamide and its metabolites after oral and intravenous administration. Under multiple dose conditions, kinetic-dynamic relations have been identified with shorter-acting drugs in dosages that give discontinuous sulphonylurea exposure. However, at continuous exposure, i.e. sustained 24-hour therapeutic concentrations in plasma, there is evidence indicating the development of tolerance, which may be caused by downregulation of beta cell sensitivity. As more sophisticated concentration-effect studies appear, it has become evident that currently recommended maximum daily doses of many sulphonylureas are too high.",E,E

Subjects were randomized to either a standard behavioral therapy (SBT) group or to one of two VLCD groups. SBT subjects received a 1,500-1,800 kcal/day diet throughout. Both VLCD groups followed a VLCD for 5 consecutive days during week 2, followed by either intermittent VLCD therapy for 1 day/week for 15 weeks (1-day) or for 5 consecutive days every 5 weeks (5-day), with a 1,500-1,800 kcal/day diet at other times.; Both VLCD groups lost more weight than the SBT group over the 20 weeks (P = 0.04). Although the groups did not differ in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) changes at 20 weeks, more subjects in the 5-day group attained a normal HbA1c when compared with the SBT group (P = 0.04). This benefit was independent of the effects of weight loss. The best predictor of overall change in FPG and HbA1c was the FPG response during the first 3 weeks of the program.; Periodic VLCDs improved weight loss in diabetic subjects. A regimen with intermittent 5-day VLCD therapy seemed particularly promising, because more subjects in this group attained a normal HbA1c. Moreover, the glucose response to a 3-week period of diet therapy predicted glycemic response at 20 weeks, and it was a better predictor of the 20-week response than initial or overall weight loss.",E,E

A total of 591 subjects who had already been randomly allocated to sulfonylurea therapy were taking maximum doses with suboptimal glycemic control, i.e., raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations of 6-15 mmol/l but no significant hyperglycemic symptoms. The main outcome measures included FPG, glycated hemoglobin, protocol-defined marked hyperglycemia, body weight, blood pressure, fasting plasma lipids, compliance, and hypoglycemia and other side effects.; After the addition of metformin, FPG concentrations decreased by mean (95% CI) -0.47 (-0.82 to -0.13) mmol/l over 3 years compared with an increase of 0.44 (0.07-0.81) mmol/l in subjects on sulfonylurea alone (P < 0.00001). Median FPG concentrations at 3 years were 8.6 vs. 9.9 mmol/l, respectively (P < 0.00001), and HbA1c values were 7.5 and 8.1%, respectively (P = 0.006).

To date, the opposing effects of exercise and sulphonylurea administration have not been systematically studied in Type 2 diabetic patients, who are not infrequently treated with sulphonylureas. In this study nine patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus were subjected to four treatments in random order on separate days: (A) endurance exercise after the administration of 3.5 mg glibenclamide; (B) as A but given only 1.75 mg glibenclamide; (C) as A but with placebo; (D) rest and administration of 1.75 mg glibenclamide. Exercise and placebo resulted in only a small decrease in glycaemia. Rest and administration of 1.75 mg glibenclamide led to a moderate but steady fall in blood glucose concentrations. If glibenclamide administration and exercise were combined, blood glucose concentrations declined more markedly. Serum insulin concentrations showed a physiological decrease during exercise and placebo administration. If patients rested after administration of glibenclamide serum insulin levels rose and remained elevated. When exercise and glibenclamide were combined the rise in serum insulin levels was blunted and insulin levels fell once exercise was begun. Thus, exercise attenuates the glibenclamide induced increase in serum insulin in moderately hyperglycaemic Type 2 diabetic patients. Nevertheless, exercise has a substantial hypoglycaemic effect in glibenclamide treated Type 2 diabetic patients.",E,E

It is administered once daily to patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus in whom glycaemia is not controlled by diet and exercise alone, and may be combined with insulin in patients with secondary sulphonylurea failure. The greatest blood glucose lowering effects of glimepiride occur in the first 4 hours after the dose. Glimepiride has fewer and less severe effects on cardiovascular variables than glibenclamide (glyburide). Pharmacokinetics are mainly unaltered in elderly patients or those with renal or liver disease. Few drug interactions with glimepiride have been documented. In patients with type 2 diabetes, glimepiride has an effective dosage range of 0.5 to 8 mg/day, although there is little difference in efficacy between dosages of 4 and 8 mg/day. Glimepiride was similar in efficacy to glibenclamide and glipizide in 1-year studies. However, glimepiride appears to reduce blood glucose more rapidly than glipizide over the first few weeks of treatment. Glimepiride and gliclazide were compared in patients with good glycaemic control at baseline in a 14-week study that noted no differences between their effects. Glimepiride plus insulin was as effective as insulin plus placebo in helping patients with secondary sulphonylurea failure to reach a fasting blood glucose target level of < or = 7.8 mmol/L, although lower insulin dosages and more rapid effects on glycaemia were seen with glimepiride. Although glimepiride monotherapy was generally well tolerated, hypoglycaemia occurred in 10 to 20% of patients treated for < or = 1 year and > or = 50% of patients receiving concomitant insulin for 6 months. Pooled clinical trial data suggest that glimepiride may have a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia than glibenclamide, particularly in the first month of treatment. Dosage is usually started at 1 mg/day, titrated to glycaemic control at 1- to 2-week intervals to a usual dosage range of 1 to 4 mg/day (maximum 6 mg/day in the UK or 8 mg/day in the US).; Glimepiride is a conveniently administered alternative to other sulphonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus not well controlled by diet alone. Its possible tolerability advantages and use in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs require further study. Glimepiride is also reported to reduce exogenous insulin requirements in patients with secondary sulphonylurea failure when administered in combination with insulin.",I,I

The glycemic response to each of the progressive, sequential phases of insulin treatment was assessed, along with the incidence of hypoglycemic reactions and the relative efficacy of different doses of glipizide in combination with fixed doses of insulin.; Five medical centers participated; half of the patients were assigned to the intensive treatment arm aiming for normal HbA1c levels. Age of patients was 60 +/- 6 years, duration of diabetes 8 +/- 3 years, and BMI 30.7 +/- 4 kg/m2. A four-step management technique was used, with patients moving to the next step if the operational goals were not met: Phase I, evening intermediate or long-acting insulin; phase II, added day-time glipizide; phase III, two injections of insulin alone; and phase IV, multiple daily insulin injections. Home glucose monitoring measurements were done twice daily and at 3:00 A.M. once a week. Hypoglycemic reactions and home glucose monitoring results were recorded and counted in each of the treatment phases.; Baseline HbA1c was 9.3 +/- 1.8%, and fasting plus serum glucose was 11.4 +/- 3.3 mmol/1. Fasting serum glucose fell to near normal in phase I, and remained so in the other treatment phases. An HbA1c separation of 2.1% between the arms was maintained during the course of the study, while the intensive arm kept HbA1c levels below 7.3% (P = 0.001). Most of the decrease in HbA1c occurred with one injection of insulin alone (phase I, -1.4%) or adding day-time glipizide (phase II, -1.9% compared with baseline). HbA1c did not decrease further after substituting two injections of insulin alone, with twice the insulin dose. Multiple daily injections resulted in an additional HbA1c fall (-2.4% compared with baseline). However, two-thirds of the patients were still on one or two injections a day at the end of the study. Changes in home glucose monitoring levels paralleled those of the HbA1c, as did the increments in number of reported hypoglycemic reactions, virtually all either ""mild"" or ""moderate"" in character. For the combination of glipizide and insulin (phase II), the only significant effect was obtained with daily doses up to 10 mg a day; there were no significant additional benefits with up to fourfold higher daily doses, and HbA1c levels had an upward trend with doses > 20 mg/day.; A simple regime of a single injection of insulin, alone or with glipizide, seemed sufficient to obtain clinically acceptable levels of HbA1c for most obese, insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes patients. Further decrease of HbA1c demanded multiple daily injections at the expense of doubling the insulin dose and the rate of hypoglycemic events. In combination therapy, doses of glipizide > 20 mg/day offered no additional benefit.",I,I

Continuation on diet alone was associated with a lower ongoing fasting plasma glucose, greater beta-cell function assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test at 6 months, and increasing age. The rate of rise of fasting plasma glucose was inversely related to the duration of successful dietary therapy, but mean weight remained constant in all groups while on diet alone. The ongoing fall in beta-cell function assessed by HOMA modelling closely mirrored the progressive rise in fasting plasma glucose: there was no change in mean insulin sensitivity in any of the groups.",E,E

The rate of failure and the features of those who fail have been poorly described. To assess secondary failure rates of sulphonylureas, we report on the responses in 1305 patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 DM randomly allocated to therapy with either chlorpropamide or glibenclamide in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). These patients were initially treated by diet for 3 months and had a fasting plasma glucose > 6 mmol l(-1); mean age 53 (SD 9) years; BMI 26.8 (SD 5.0) kg m(-2); and median fasting plasma glucose 9.1 (7.6-12.5 quartiles) mmol l(-1). If their fasting plasma glucose subsequently rose above 15.0 mmol l(-1), or they developed hyperglycaemic symptoms, additional hypoglycaemic therapy was given: metformin, ultratard insulin, and soluble insulin as required. By 6 years, 44% had required additional therapy. Of those randomized to glibenclamide, 48% required additional therapy by 6 years, compared with 40% of those allocated to chlorpropamide (p < 0.01). Sixty-one per cent, 39%, and 23%, respectively, of patients with fasting plasma glucose > or = 10.0 mmol l(-1), > or = 7.8 mmol l(-1) to < 10.0 mmol l(-1) and < 7.8 mmol l(-1) at randomization required additional therapy (p < 0.001).

Modelled beta-cell function showed that those with lower function were more likely to fail (p < 0.0001). Thus sulphonylureas fail as a therapeutic agent at rates which are dependent both on the phenotype at presentation and perhaps on the agent used initially. Higher failure rates were found in those with higher glucose concentrations, those who were younger, those with lower beta-cell reserve and those randomized to glibenclamide compared with chlorpropamide.",I,I

Several studies have suggested an association between magnesium (Mg) depletion and insulin resistance and/or reduction of insulin secretion in these cases. Our purpose was to evaluate if Mg supplementation (as magnesium oxide [MgO]) would improve metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.; We studied 128 patients with type 2 diabetes (32 men, 96 women, aged 30-69 years), treated by diet or diet plus oral antidiabetic drugs, in the Bahia Federal University Hospital, Brazil. Patients at risk for hypomagnesemia or with reduced renal function were excluded. This study was a clinical randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Patients received either placebo, 20.7 mmol MgO, or 41.4 mmol MgO daily (elementary Mg) for 30 days. Mg concentrations were measured in plasma, in mononuclear cells, and in 24-h urine samples. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1, and fructosamine were used as parameters of metabolic control.; Of the patients, 47.7% had low plasma Mg, and 31.1% had low intramononuclear Mg levels. Intracellular Mg in patients with diabetes was significantly lower than in the normal population (62 blood donors; 1.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.6 micrograms/mg of total proteins). No correlation was found between plasma and intracellular Mg concentrations (r = -0.179; P = 0.15) or between Mg concentrations and glycemic control (r = -0.165; P = 0.12). Intracellular Mg levels were lower in patients with peripheral neuropathy than in those without (1.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.6 micrograms/mg). Similar findings were observed in patients with coronary disease (1.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.6 micrograms/mg). In the placebo and in the 20.7 mmol Mg groups, neither a change in plasma and intracellular levels nor an improvement in glycemic control were observed. Replacement with 41.4 mmol Mg tended to increase plasma, cellular, and urine Mg and caused a significant fall (4.1 +/- 0.8 to 3.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/l) in fructosamine (normal, 1.87-2.87 mmol/l).; Mg depletion is common in poorly controlled patients with type 2 diabetes, especially in those with neuropathy or coronary disease.

There were 208 subjects with secondary failure to sulfonylureas who took glimepiride titrated to 8 mg b.i.d. for 8 weeks; 145 subjects with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 180-300 mg/dl (10-16.7 mmol/l) on this treatment were randomized to placebo plus insulin (PI) or glimepiride plus insulin (GI) for 24 weeks. A dosage of 70/30 insulin before supper was titrated, seeking fasting capillary blood glucose (FBG) 120 mg/dl (6.7 mmol/l), equivalent to FPG 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). Outcome measures included FPG, HbA1c, insulin dosage, weight, serum insulin and lipids, and adverse events.; FPG and HbA1c were equivalent at baseline: 261 vs. 250 mg/dl (14.5 vs. 13.9 mmol/l), and 9.9 vs. 9.7%. At 24 weeks, the FPG target was achieved in both groups (136 vs. 138 mg/dl, 7.6 vs. 7.6 mmol/l), and HbA1c values were equal (7.7 vs. 7.6%). However, with GI, control improved faster and fewer subjects dropped out (3 vs. 15%, P < 0.01), and less insulin was needed (49 vs. 78 U/d, P < 0.001). The outcomes were alike in other respects. No subject had severe hypoglycemia.; Injection of 70/30 insulin before supper safely restored glycemic control of type 2 diabetes not controlled by glimepiride alone.

A soft gelatin capsule containing PEG 400, PEG 4000, Tween 20 and glycerin was prepared as a formulation that may accelerate dissolution of gliclazide. The in vitro dissolution of gliclazide at pH 7.2 was identical for the soft capsule and conventional tablets, Diamicron and Diberin. However, at pH 1, 2 and 4.0 the dissolution from the soft capsule was more rapid compared to the tablets. When bioavailability parameters were compared following oral administration of the soft capsule and Diamicron to 16 healthy Korean male subjects, the parameters representing the amount of adsorption (i.e. the area under the serum gliclazide concentration vs. time curve up to 24 h, AUC24, and the peak serum concentration Cmax) were not statistically different for both formulations. However, the time required to reach the peak (Tmax) was significantly shorter for the soft capsule than for the Diamicron. Our results, therefore, indicate that a rapid elevation of serum gliclazide concentration following oral administration of a formulation can be achieved by accelerating the in vitro dissolution of gliclazide from the formulation into the acidic buffers. Thus, the rate of gastrointestinal absorption of gliclazide appears to be dependent on its in vivo dissolution rate in gastric fluid. A soft capsule containing a PEG 400 suspension of gliclazide appears to be an appropriate formulation for accelerating the dissolution.",E,E

There is concern that sulphonylureas may increase cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and that high insulin concentrations may enhance atheroma formation. We compared the effects of intensive blood-glucose control with either sulphonylurea or insulin and conventional treatment on the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes in a randomised controlled trial.; 3867 newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes, median age 54 years (IQR 48-60 years), who after 3 months' diet treatment had a mean of two fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations of 6.1-15.0 mmol/L were randomly assigned intensive policy with a sulphonylurea (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or glipizide) or with insulin, or conventional policy with diet. The aim in the intensive group was FPG less than 6 mmol/L. In the conventional group, the aim was the best achievable FPG with diet alone; drugs were added only if there were hyperglycaemic symptoms or FPG greater than 15 mmol/L. Three aggregate endpoints were used to assess differences between conventional and intensive treatment: any diabetes-related endpoint (sudden death, death from hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke, renal failure, amputation [of at least one digit], vitreous haemorrhage, retinopathy requiring photocoagulation, blindness in one eye, or cataract extraction); diabetes-related death (death from myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, and sudden death); all-cause mortality. Single clinical endpoints and surrogate subclinical endpoints were also assessed. All analyses were by intention to treat and frequency of hypoglycaemia was also analysed by actual therapy.; Over 10 years, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 7.0% (6.2-8.2) in the intensive group compared with 7.9% (6.9-8.8) in the conventional group--an 11% reduction. There was no difference in HbA1c among agents in the intensive group. Compared with the conventional group, the risk in the intensive group was 12% lower (95% CI 1-21, p=0.029) for any diabetes-related endpoint; 10% lower (-11 to 27, p=0.34) for any diabetes-related death; and 6% lower (-10 to 20, p=0.44) for all-cause mortality. Most of the risk reduction in the any diabetes-related aggregate endpoint was due to a 25% risk reduction (7-40, p=0.0099) in microvascular endpoints, including the need for retinal photocoagulation. There was no difference for any of the three aggregate endpoints between the three intensive agents (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin). Patients in the intensive group had more hypoglycaemic episodes than those in the conventional group on both types of analysis (both p<0.0001). The rates of major hypoglycaemic episodes per year were 0.7% with conventional treatment, 1.0% with chlorpropamide, 1.4% with glibenclamide, and 1.8% with insulin. Weight gain was significantly higher in the intensive group (mean 2.9 kg) than in the conventional group (p<0.001), and patients assigned insulin had a greater gain in weight (4.0 kg) than those assigned chlorpropamide (2.6 kg) or glibenclamide (1.7 kg).; Intensive blood-glucose control by either sulphonylureas or insulin substantially decreases the risk of microvascular complications, but not macrovascular disease, in patients with type 2 diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",I,I

A secondary analysis compared the 342 patients allocated metformin with 951 overweight patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control with chlorpropamide (n=265), glibenclamide (n=277), or insulin (n=409). The primary outcome measures were aggregates of any diabetes-related clinical endpoint, diabetes-related death, and all-cause mortality. In a supplementary randomised controlled trial, 537 non-overweight and overweight patients, mean age 59 years, who were already on maximum sulphonylurea therapy but had raised FPG (6.1-15.0 mmol/L) were allocated continuing sulphonylurea therapy alone (n=269) or addition of metformin (n=268).; Median glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.4% in the metformin group compared with 8.0% in the conventional group. Patients allocated metformin, compared with the conventional group, had risk reductions of 32% (95% CI 13-47, p=0.002) for any diabetes-related endpoint, 42% for diabetes-related death (9-63, p=0.017), and 36% for all-cause mortality (9-55, p=0.011). Among patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control, metformin showed a greater effect than chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin for any diabetes-related endpoint (p=0.0034), all-cause mortality (p=0.021), and stroke (p=0.032). Early addition of metformin in sulphonylurea-treated patients was associated with an increased risk of diabetes-related death (96% increased risk [95% CI 2-275], p=0.039) compared with continued sulphonylurea alone. A combined analysis of the main and supplementary studies showed fewer metformin-allocated patients having diabetes-related endpoints (risk reduction 19% [2-33], p=0.033). Epidemiological assessment of the possible association of death from diabetes-related causes with the concurrent therapy of diabetes in 4416 patients did not show an increased risk in diabetes-related death in patients treated with a combination of sulphonylurea and metformin (risk reduction 5% [-33 to 32], p=0.78).; Since intensive glucose control with metformin appears to decrease the risk of diabetes-related endpoints in overweight diabetic patients, and is associated with less weight gain and fewer hypoglycaemic attacks than are insulin and sulphonylureas, it may be the first-line pharmacological therapy of choice in these patients.",E,E

Key search terms included insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, non-insulin-dependent, macrovascular complications, microvascular complications, and intensive glycemic control.; Selection of prospective epidemiologic and clinical studies were limited to those focusing on the management of type 2 diabetes. All articles with pertinent information relevant to the scope of this article were reviewed.; The pathophysiology of type 1 and type 2 diabetes differ; however, both share chronic complications that significantly affect morbidity and mortality. People with type 1 diabetes have an absolute deficiency of insulin, whereas people with type 2 diabetes have varying degrees of insulin resistance and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) has clearly indicated that intense control of blood glucose in type 1 diabetes prevents and slows the progression of microvascular (i.e., retinopathy, nephropathy) and neuropathic complications. The Kumamoto study showed similar results in nonobese patients with type 2 diabetes. Intense insulin therapy in both populations has proven advantageous, thus supporting a common pathophysiologic process for the microvascular and neuropathic complications. Trends were seen toward fewer macrovascular (atherosclerotic disease) complications in the intensive insulin arm of the DCCT. Conversely, trends were seen toward an increase in macrovascular complications in the VA Cooperative study in people with type 2 diabetes using intensive insulin therapy. This may suggest a discordance in the pathophysiology of macrovascular disease between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, it remains uncertain whether tight glycemic control prevents the onset or slows the progression of macrovascular disease. Two studies (the University Group Diabetes Program and the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study on Glycemic Control and Complications in Type 2 Diabetes) to date have examined pharmacotherapy options for patients with type 2 diabetes and resultant macrovascular complications. It has yet to be determined whether any therapeutic intervention will decrease the morbidity and mortality of macrovascular disease in this population.; In type 2 diabetes, limited prospective evidence does support tight glycemic control to help prevent or slow the progression of microvascular and neuropathic complications. It is uncertain whether tight glycemic control decreases macrovascular complications and which pharmacotherapeutic agent(s) is/are the best options. However, therapy that improves glucose control in combination with aggressive risk factor management should be initiated and enforced in patients with type 2 diabetes in an effort to reduce long-term complications.",E,E

Responses of diastolic blood pressure to intravenous infusion of angiotensin II and forearm vascular responses to intra-brachial arterial infusion of angiotensin II were significantly greater during glibenclamide treatment than they were with placebo (P < 0.05). However, the enhancement of forearm vascular responses during glibenclamide treatment appeared to be restricted to patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Responses of blood pressure to intravenous infusion of noradrenaline and forearm vascular responses to infusions of noradrenaline, acetylcholine and nitroprusside did not differ between glibenclamide treatment and placebo; neither did basal forearm vascular resistance.; Glibenclamide therapy is associated with greater responses of blood pressure and forearm vascular responses to infusion of angiotensin and higher nocturnal blood pressures. This effect appears to be influenced by concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.",E,E

After screening and a 2-week washout period, 99 patients were randomized to receive either repaglinide (n = 66) or placebo (n = 33). Patients underwent 6 weeks of dose adjustment followed by 12 weeks of dose maintenance. Fasting and stimulated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were measured at predetermined intervals. Adverse events and hypoglycemic episodes were recorded.; From baseline to last visit, mean HbA1c decreased from 8.5 to 7.8% in patients treated with repaglinide and increased from 8.1 to 9.3% in patients receiving placebo, with a statistically significant difference of - 1.7% (P < 0.0001) between treatment groups at the last visit. Mean fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose increased in patients receiving placebo and decreased in patients treated with repaglinide, with statistically significant (P < 0.01) differences between groups at the last visit. Concentrations of fasting and postprandial insulin and C-peptide were lower at the last visit compared with baseline for patients treated with placebo and higher for patients treated with repaglinide, and the differences between groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Overall, repaglinide was well tolerated.; This study demonstrated that repaglinide was safe and efficacious in lowering blood glucose concentrations. In addition to overall improvement in glycemic control noted with repaglinide in both sulfonylurea-treated patients and oral hypoglycemic agent-naive patients, repaglinide had a potent glucose-lowering effect in the postprandial period.",I,I

It is not known, however, whether after secondary sulfonylurea failure, GLP-1 is still effective.; Therefore, 10 type 2 diabetic patients (6 women, 4 men; age 65+/-10 years, BMI 30.4+/-5.1 kg/m2, HbA1c 8.2+/-1.5%, 6+/-3 [2-13] years after starting insulin treatment) were examined in the fasting state after discontinuing NPH insulin on the evening before the two study days. GLP-1 (1.2 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1) or placebo (NaCl with 1% human serum albumin) were infused over 6 h. Plasma glucose (glucose oxidase) insulin (IMx), and C-peptide (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures analysis of variance.; Fasting plasma glucose was 9.4+/-0.5 mmol/l and was reduced by GLP-1 to 5.3+/-0.3 (3.9-7.3) mmol/l (placebo: 8.2+/-0.7 mmol/l; P < 0.0001). GLP-1 transiently increased insulin (from 115+/-31 to 222+/-64 pmol/l at 150 min; P < 0.0001) and C-peptide (from 1.00+/-0.12 to 1.90+/-0.23 nmol/l at 120 min; P < 0.0001) with no effect of placebo. Glucagon and free fatty acids were lowered transiently. After normalization of plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentrations became lower again during the ongoing administration of exogenous GLP-1, and no hypoglycemia occurred.; It is concluded that exogenous GLP-1 effectively lowers plasma glucose concentrations in advanced type 2 diabetes long after sulfonylurea secondary failure. These findings may broaden the applicability of GLP-1-derived drugs as a new treatment to nearly all type 2 diabetic patients.",E,E

Ten healthy subjects (7 men, 3 women, 52 +/- 4 years old) served as control subjects. Baseline plasma VCAM-1 concentrations were higher (p = 0.007) in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients (707.9 +/- 52.5 ng/ml) than in control subjects (627.3 +/- 84.6 ng/ml). Intraerythrocytic GSSG content was higher (non-insulin dependent diabetic patients: 0.618 +/- 0.185 micromol/g Hb; control subjects: 0.352 +/- 0.04 micromol/g Hb, p = 0.0002), whereas intraerythrocytic GSH concentrations were lower (p = 0.001) in non-insulin dependent diabetic patients (6.0 +/- 0.7 micromol/g Hb) than in control subjects (7.1 +/- 0.5 micromol/g Hb). The mean GSH:GSSG ratio was also lower (p = 0.0001) in the first (10.9 +/- 4.5) than in the second group (20.2 +/- 1.4).

Our data indicate that the vascular endothelium is activated in non-insulin dependent diabetes. Antioxidant treatment counterbalanced such endothelial activation. Thus, antioxidant agents might protect against oxidant-related upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and slow down the progression of vascular damage in non-insulin dependent diabetes.",E,E

This study compares the effects of the two enteral nutritional formulae in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes) treated with sulfonylurea or insulin. Fifty-two type 2 diabetes patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the two enteral formulae. Test enteral formula breakfast (250 cc) were consumed at approximately 0900 h after routine medications (insulin or oral agents) had been taken. Venous blood samples were obtained during fasting, before medication, and at 30 and 120 min after the start of the meal. The glycemic response of patients to the HCF was significantly greater than to RCF, but lower than in the sulfonyl type 2 diabetes treated groups. The incremental glucose response was within acceptable levels except in insulin treatment type 2 diabetes patients given HCF. Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide responses were higher in HCF than RCF groups. Two-factor analysis of variance on mean increments of blood glucose and C-peptide from basal levels to 30 min show the type of enteral nutrition as the main factor (P = 0.0010 and P = 0.0005, respectively). The RCF formula supplies 50.0% of energy as fat and 33.3% as carbohydrates, so it may be a ketogenic diet. It was found that both ketone bodies were higher after RCF than after HCF ingestion, but without statistical significance. We conclude that the partial replacement of complex digestible carbohydrates with monounsaturated fatty acids in the enteral formulae for supplementation of oral diet may improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The long-term effects of enteral diets high in monounsaturated fatty acids need further evaluation in patients with type 2 diabetes.",5,E

The extent of possible cerebral sequelae after recovery is still unknown. We studied the impact of previous hypoglycemic coma on neurophysiological measures of cognitive brain function in 108 patients with adult-onset IDDM receiving intensive insulin treatment. In the study, 55 IDDM patients (age 38 +/- 14 years, mean +/- SD) who had a history of > or =1 (median 3, range 1-35) comatose hypoglycemic event were compared with 53 IDDM patients (age 34 +/- 12 years) with no history of hypoglycemic events using P300 event-related potentials and psychometric tests (the Mini-Mental State Exam and trailmaking test, part A). Findings on these patients were compared with those from 108 matched healthy control subjects. No difference was observed in P300 latencies and psychometric tests between patients with and without a history of hypoglycemic coma (P300 latency, 346 vs. 342 ms; trailmaking test, 31 vs. 30 s; Mini-Mental State Exam, 29.5 vs. 29.6; NS). In diabetic patients, however, P300 latencies were delayed compared with those of healthy control subjects (344 vs. 332 ms; P < 0.001) and were correlated to diabetes duration but not to total hypoglycemic episodes. Scores on the Mini-Mental State Exam (29.5 vs. 29.6; P = 0.59) and trailmaking test (31 vs. 28 s; P = 0.10) were not different between patients and control subjects. In conclusion, previous episodes of hypoglycemic coma are not associated with permanent impairment of cognitive brain function in patients with adult-onset IDDM receiving intensive insulin treatment compared with patients without such episodes.

After nocturnal hypoglycemia, in contrast to nocturnal euglycemia, there was less deterioration of cognitive function overall (P = 0.0065) during hypoglycemia based on analysis of the sum of standardized scores (z-scores). There was relative preservation of measures of pattern recognition and memory (the delayed non-match to sample task, P = 0.0371) and of attention (the Stroop arrow-word task, P = 0.0395), but not of measures of information processing (the paced serial addition task) or declarative memory (the delayed paragraph recall task), after nocturnal hypoglycemia.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of insulin treatment on eye-grounds in elderly (> 65-year-old) Type 2 diabetic patients with secondary failure of oral antidiabetic-drug therapy. Eye examinations were performed in 37 patients randomized to insulin (n = 19) or sulphonylurea (n = 16) treatment and re-investigated after one year. Insulin treatment reduced HbA1c from 9.3% to 7.3% (p < 0.001) after one year. In the sulphonylurea-treated group, HbA1c did not change (9.1 vs. 9.3%). At the start, 65% of the patients had retinopathy, and after one year progression was noted in 7/35 patients (20%; 5 insulin- and 2 sulphonylurea-treated). In the insulin-treated group, the 5 patients with progression had higher initial fasting blood-glucose levels than other patients in the group (15.8 vs 13.1 mmol/L, p < 0.05). Initial HbA1c levels did not differ between the groups (9.8 vs. 9.1%, n.s.), nor the reduction of HbA1c levels during treatment (2.2 vs. 1.3% n.s.). Thus, diabetic retinopathy in this study was common among elderly Type 2 diabetic patients. The progression of retinopathy may in fact be associated with insulin treatment or improvement of metabolic control.",E,E

After Lispro, the mean postprandial increase in plasma glucose was 29% lower and the increase in insulin concentration 25% higher than after regular insulin (p < 0.05). Suppression of endogenous glucose production was similar with both types of insulin. Thus, preprandial injection of Lispro reduced postprandial glucose increments in Type 2 diabetic patients as compared to regular insulin.

We performed a crossover study in 50 NIDDM patients with secondary failure to glibenclamide by comparing the addition to sulphonylurea of either a low-dose bedtime NPH insulin or a t.i.d. oral metformin and by analyzing treatment efficacy in relation to patient and disease characteristics. Both combined therapies clearly improved glycaemic control. HbA1 c were similarly reduced by the addition of either bedtime NPH insulin (7.6+/-0.34 vs 8.7+/-0.35, p<0.01) or metformin (7.6+/-0.22 vs 8.6+/-0.31, p<0.01). Also fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and post-prandial plasma glucose (PPPG) significantly decreased (p<0.01) with both treatments. Bed-time NPH insulin was more effective on FPG reduction than metformin (-36+/-2% vs -25+/-2%, p<0.01); in contrast, metformin addition was more effective on PPPG reduction than bedtime NPH insulin addition (-30+/-2% vs 20+/-3%, p<0.01). Serum cholesterol was marginally but significantly decreased after metformin (5.49+/-0.19 vs 5.91 +/-0.18 mM, p<0.05) but not after NPH insulin. Body weight increase was significantly greater after insulin addition than after metformin (1.47+/-0.25 Kg vs 0.64+/-0.17 p=0.02). All patients preferred the addition of metformin rather than NPH insulin. None of the measured clinical and metabolic variables (before treatment FPG and PPPG, HbA1 c, post-glucagon C-peptide levels, insulin sensitivity, patient age, BMI and diabetes duration) significantly correlated to the efficacy of the two combined treatments studied. In conclusion, in NIDDM patients with secondary failure to sulphonylureas the addition of either low-dose bedtime NPH insulin or t.i.d. metformin is similarly effective in improving glycaemic control. Metformin is better accepted by patients and provides a modest advantage in terms of body weight and cholesterol levels. The most common clinical and metabolic variables are not useful for predicting the efficacy of these two combined treatments.",E,E
