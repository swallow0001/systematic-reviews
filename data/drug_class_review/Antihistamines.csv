10070306,Docetaxel (Taxotere) plus cisplatin: an active and well-tolerated combination in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cisplatin; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neutropenia; Paclitaxel; Survival Rate; Taxoids; Treatment Outcome","Le Chevalier, T; Monnier, A; Douillard, J Y; Ruffie, P; Sun, X S; Belli, L; Ibrahim, N; Bougon, N; BèŒ…rille, J","The activity of the combination of intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles then every 6 weeks was investigated in 51 chemotherapy naive patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The population was 92% male, with a median age of 54 years and median performance status of 1; 80% of patients had metastatic disease, including 37% with bone involvement. All patients received prophylactic premedication (ondansetron, dexamethasone plus cetirizine) and standard hyperhydration. With a median of 4 treatment cycles (range 1-9), 14 of 42 evaluable patients responded (overall response rate 33.3%, 95% CI 19.6-49.6%); the median response duration was 7.3 months, median survival 8.4 months, and 1-year survival rate 35%. The most common adverse event was neutropenia, occurring in two-thirds of patients. Neurosensory effects were cumulative but generally mild. No treatment-related deaths occurred. This combination of docetaxel/cisplatin showed activity in advanced NSCLC. While it was not clearly superior to single-agent docetaxel, due to differences in prognostic factors among the patients in open trials, a randomised study would be needed to demonstrate definitively whether cisplatin adds to the activity of docetaxel or not.",E,E
10090440,Link between patient preferences and treatment outcomes in seasonal allergic rhinitis: an empiric investigation.,"Adult; Double-Blind Method; Female; Histamine H1 Antagonists; Humans; Loratadine; Male; Patient Satisfaction; Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial; Surveys and Questionnaires; Terfenadine; Treatment Outcome","Ricard, N; Kind, P; Christian, S; Jensen, M; Stewart, J","In a multicenter, parallel-group, double-masked, randomized study, two questionnaires were administered to a clinical study population to identify which specific symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis patients perceived as most important to relieve (personal preferences) and to learn whether any relationship existed between patient preferences and the severity of their symptoms during treatment with antihistamines. The group was composed of 256 males and 313 females. Their mean age was 32.4 years, and mean duration of seasonal allergic rhinitis was 14.5 years, with mean age of onset of 17.7 years. After receiving placebo for 1 week, patients were randomly allocated to receive an antihistamine (fexofenadine or loratadine) for 2 weeks. Patient preferences for relief of individual allergy symptoms (rhinitis; sneezing; itchy, watery, red eyes; itchy nose, palate, or throat) and related conditions (fatigue, physical limitations) were scored using 2 different questionnaires before treatment (0-to-10 category rating scale for assessing the 4 symptoms of allergic rhinitis) and after receiving placebo for 1 week (Feeling Thermometer). Symptom severity was reported in patient diaries after 1 and 2 weeks of antihistamine treatment and was measured by patient self-assessment. All symptoms were considered by the patients to be important to relieve, the most important being itchy, watery, red eyes and rhinorrhea. The severity of allergy symptoms was consistently related to the importance of symptoms identified before treatment. Therefore, including patient preferences in medical evaluations might be a useful tool in evaluating the success of their treatment.",I,I

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, 469 patients with moderate-to-severe SAR symptoms were treated for 2 weeks with one of the following: Claritin-D 24 Hour (a combination tablet formulation of loratadine 10 mg in the coating and pseudoephedrine sulfate 240 mg in an extended-release core), Claritin-D 12 Hour (a combination tablet formulation of loratadine 5 mg in the tablet coating and 120 mg pseudoephedrine sulfate, 60 mg in the coating and 60 mg in the core), or placebo. Claritin-D 24 Hour and Claritin-D 12 Hour were consistently superior to placebo (P < 0.01) in reducing total, nasal, and nonnasal symptom scores. Patients in the Claritin-D 24 Hour and Claritin-D 12 Hour groups also had significantly greater (P </= 0.05) relief of rhinorrhea and nasal stuffiness as compared with placebo. Insomnia was reported significantly more often (P < 0.01) in Claritin-D 12 Hour (15%) patients compared with Claritin-D 24 Hour (4%) and placebo (2%) patients. Dry mouth was reported significantly more often (P < 0.05) in Claritin-D 24 Hour (13%) and Claritin-D 12 Hour (13%) groups compared with placebo (4%). Claritin-D 24 Hour has efficacy comparable to Claritin-D 12 Hour in relieving allergic rhinitis symptoms while producing significantly less insomnia.",E,E

We assessed their nasal effects 24 hours after administration in patients with allergic rhinitis, using a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial. Nasal challenge was performed by nebulization of increasing doubling dosages of histamine (0.04-1.28 mg/nostril) in 12 patients (seven males, five females, aged 31 +/- 7 years). Nasal airway resistance was measured by posterior rhinomanometry 24 hours after intake of cetirizine (10 mg), loratadine (10 mg), or placebo. Baseline nasal airway resistance was identical on all study days (2.86 +/- 0.10 cm H2 O/L per second). Twenty-four hours after intake, the dose-response curve of nasal obstruction to histamine was significantly lower after treatment with cetirizine compared with placebo (P < 0.05). However, although the curve was lower on loratadine than on placebo, the curves did not differ significantly. In conclusion, our study shows significant efficacy of cetirizine, but not of loratadine, in the nose at 24 hours after a single dose. This suggests that the nasal action of cetirizine is longer lasting than that of loratadine in patients with allergic rhinitis.",I,1

A 28-day screening period, including a 5-day baseline period, preceded a 4-week treatment period. Reduction in rhinitis symptom scores was evident in both groups as early as day 1, with no significant between-group differences during week 1. At weeks 2, 3, and 4, patients treated with triamcinolone acetonide were significantly (P < 0.05) more improved in total nasal score, nasal itch, nasal stuffiness, and sneezing than were patients treated with loratadine. At weeks 3 and 4, rhinorrhea and ocular symptoms were significantly (P < 0.05) more improved from baseline among triamcinolone acetonide patients compared with loratadine patients. There was no significant between-group difference in relief from postnasal drip at any time point. Physicians' global evaluations significantly (P = 0.002) favored triamcinolone acetonide at the final visit, with moderate to complete relief of symptoms attained by 68% of triamcinolone acetonide patients and 59% of loratadine patients. Over the 4-week treatment period, triamcinolone acetonide patients had significantly greater improvement in total nasal score, nasal itch, nasal stuffiness, sneezing, and ocular symptoms. Both treatments were well tolerated, with headache being the most frequently reported drug-related adverse effect in both the triamcinolone acetonide (15%) and loratadine (11%) groups. These results indicate that triamcinolone acetonide is more effective than oral loratadine in relieving the symptoms of ragweed-induced seasonal allergic rhinitis.",E,E

To elucidate the involvement of histamine to ACh-provoked vasoreactions and sensations, we applied a selective H1-antagonist (cetirizine) 3 h prior to the ACh-administration. Solutions of acetylcholine (ACh, 0.55 M) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP, 1.5x 10(-5) M) were injected (10 microl) intracutaneously into the volar forearm of 14 healthy subjects and 14 atopic eczema (AE) patients. The substances were applied as single stimulus as well as in combination. Sensations evoked by the stimulation were recorded using 2 visual analog scales (VAS). Vasoreactions were analyzed with the new technique of computer assisted video image analysis. With this method we measured the dynamics of the flare development and the extension of the final flare size independent of the observer's assessment. In control subjects the development and extension of the final flare size was almost similar, regardless whether ACh and VIP were applied in combination or separately. Compared to healthy controls, after injection of ACh, VIP and the combination of VIP and ACh smaller flare sizes were recorded in AE patients. After VIP was given, the control subjects reported pruritus, which was significantly augmented compared to AE patients. In contrast, controls reported a burning pain after the injection of ACh, whereas AE patients felt predominantly pruritus. Itch sensation after the combined application of VIP and ACh was significantly elevated in AE patients. Consequently, we assume that mediators of sudomotor neurons, i.e., VIP and ACh meet in AE patients apparently sensitized nociceptive primary afferents and induce exaggerated itch, pain and flare responses. When pretreated with the selective H1-antagonist cetirizine before ACh was injected, pain and erythema due to ACh was diminished in healthy controls. In contrast, cetirizine did not influence the size of erythema and the magnitude of sensation in AE patients. We conclude, that the release of histamine is not involved in ACh-induced erythema and pruritus in AE. These data provide evidence that pruritus can be elicited in atopic eczema by a cholinergic, histamine independent mechanism.",E,E

The effects of age, sex, dose, duration of treatment, and the interaction with P450 inhibitor drugs were also examined.; We carried out a cohort study with a nested case-control analysis using the UK-based General Practice Research database (GPRD). The study cohort included persons aged less than 80 years old who received their first prescription for any of the five study drugs between January 1, 1992 and September 30, 1996. We estimated relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias with current use of antihistamines as compared with non use.; The study cohort included 197425 persons who received 513012 prescriptions. Over the study period 18 valid cases of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias were detected. Nine occurred during the current use of any antihistamine, resulting in a crude incidence of 1.9 per 10000 person-years (95%CI: 1.0-3.6) and a relative risk of 4.2 (95%CI: 1.5-11.8) as compared with non use. Astemizole presented the highest relative risk (RR= 19.0; 95%CI: 4.8-76.0) of all study drugs, while terfenadine (RR=2.1; 95%CI:0.5-8.5) was in the range of other nonsedating antihistamines. Older age was associated with a greater risk of ventricular arrhythmias (RR=7.4; 95%CI: 2.6-21.4) and seemed to increase the effect of antihistamines (RR=6.4; 95%CI: 1.7-24.8). The proportions of high dose terfenadine and the concomitant use with P450 inhibitors among current users of terfenadine were 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively over the study period with no single case of ventricular arrhythmias occurring in the presence of these two risk factors.; The use of nonsedating antihistamines increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias by a factor of four in the general population. Yet, the absolute effect is quite low requiring 57000 prescriptions, or 5300 person-years of use for one case to occur. The risk associated with terfenadine was no different from that with other nonsedating antihistamines.",I,E
10230583,Treating allergic rhinitis in pregnancy. Safety considerations.,"Animals; Female; Histamine H1 Antagonists; Humans; Nasal Decongestants; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal","Mazzotta, P; Loebstein, R; Koren, G","Allergic rhinitis affects approximately one-third of women of childbearing age. As a result, symptoms ranging from sneezing and itching to severe nasal obstruction may require pharmacotherapy. However, product labels state that medications for allergic rhinitis should be avoided during pregnancy due to lack of fetal safety data, even though the majority of the agents have human data which refute these notions. We present a systematic and critical review of the medical literature on the use of pharmacotherapy for the management of allergic rhinitis during pregnancy. Electronic databases and other literature sources were searched to identify observational controlled studies focusing on the rate of fetal malformations in pregnant women exposed to agents used to treat allergic rhinitis and related diseases compared with controls. Immunotherapy and intranasal sodium cromoglycate (cromolyn) and beclo-methasone would be considered as first-line therapy, both because of their lack of association with congenital abnormalities and their superior efficacy to other agents. First-generation (e.g. chlorpheniramine) and second-generation (e.g. cetirizine) antihistamines have not been incriminated as human teratogens. However, first-generation antihistamines are favoured over their second generation counterparts based on their longevity, leading to more conclusive evidence of safety. There are no controlled trials with loratadine and fexofenadine in human pregnancy. Oral, intranasal and ophthalmic decongestants (e.g. pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine and oxymetazoline, respectively) should be considered as second-line therapy, although further studies are needed to clarify their fetal safety. No human reproductive studies have been reported with the ophthalmic antihistamines ketorolac and levocabastine, although preliminary data reported suggest no association between pheniramine and congenital malformations. There are no documented epidemiological studies with intranasal corticosteroids (e.g. budesonide, fluticasone propionate, mometasone) during pregnancy; however, inhaled corticosteroids (e.g. beclomethasone) have not been incriminated as teratogens and are commonly used by pregnant women who have asthma. In summary, women with allergic rhinitis during pregnancy can be treated with a number of pharmacological agents without concern of untoward effects on their unborn child. Although the choice of agents in part should be based on evidence of fetal safety, issue of efficacy needs to be addressed in order to optimally manage this condition.",I,E

The effect of this recently approved nonsedating antihistamine on the corrected QT interval (QTc) was evaluated in dose-tolerance, safety, and drug-interaction studies with healthy volunteers, and in clinical studies in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Twelve-lead electrocardiographic data were collected once before and after dosing or serially throughout these studies. Outliers were defined as QTc > 440 ms with a > or = 10 ms increase from baseline. The recommended fexofenadine HCl dose is 60 mg twice daily. Fexofenadine HCl doses up to 800 mg once daily or 690 mg twice daily for 28 days resulted in no dose-related increases in QTc. Longer term studies indicated no statistically significant QTc increases compared with placebo in patients receiving fexofenadine HCl 80 mg twice daily for 3 months, 60 mg twice daily for 6 months, or 240 mg once daily for 12 months. Interaction studies showed no significant increases in QTc when fexofenadine HCl 120 mg twice daily was administered in combination with erythromycin (500 mg 3 times daily) or ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) after dosing to steady state (6.5 days). Clinical trials in patients with SAR (n = 1,160) treated with 40, 60, 120, or 240 mg twice-daily fexofenadine HCl or placebo indicated no dose-related increases in QTc and no statistically significant increases in mean QTc compared with placebo. In controlled trials with approximately 6,000 persons, no case of fexofenadine-associated torsades de pointes was observed. The frequency and magnitude of QTc outliers were similar between fexofenadine HCl and placebo in all studies. Based on a large clinical database, we conclude that fexofenadine HCl has no significant effect on QTc, even at doses > 10-fold higher than that is efficacious for SAR.",E,E
10335901,Variations among non-sedating antihistamines: are there real differences?,Astemizole; Benzimidazoles; Butyrophenones; Central Nervous System; Cetirizine; Drug Interactions; Heart; Histamine H1 Antagonists; Humans; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Loratadine; Piperidines; Potassium Channel Blockers; Terfenadine; Triprolidine,"Mattila, M J; Paakkari, I","Most of the modern non-sedating H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines) penetrate the brain poorly, allowing the use of doses large enough to counteract allergic processes in peripheral tissues without important central effects. The antihistamines reviewed here are acrivastine, astemizole, cetirizine, ebastine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine, and terfenadine. However, these drugs are not entirely free from central effects, and there are at least quantitative differences between them. Although psychomotor and sleep studies in healthy subjects in the laboratory may predict that an antihistamine does not cause drowsiness, the safety margin can be narrow enough to cause a central sedating effect during actual treatment. This might result from a patient's individual sensitivity, disease-induced sedation, or drug dosages that are for various reasons relatively or absolutely larger (patient's weight, poor response, reduced drug clearance, interactions). Mild to even moderate sedation is not necessarily a major nuisance, particularly if stimulants need be added to the regimen (e.g. in perennial rhinitis). Furthermore, patients can adjust doses themselves if needed. Sedating antihistamines are not needed for long-term itching, because glucocorticoids are indicated and more effective. It is wise to restrict or avoid using antihistamines (astemizole, terfenadine) that can cause cardiac dysrhythmias, because even severe cardiotoxicity can occur in certain pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. Histamine H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines) are used in the treatment of allergic disorders. The therapeutic effects of most of the older antihistamines were associated with sedating effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and antimuscarinic effects causing dry mouth and blurred vision. Non-specific ""quinidine-like"" or local anaesthetic actions often led to cardiotoxicity in animals and man. Although such adverse effects varied from drug to drug, there was some degree of sedation with all old antihistamines. Non-sedating antihistamines have become available during the past 15 years. Some of them also have antiserotonin or other actions that oppose allergic inflammation, and they are not entirely free from sedative effects either. In small to moderate ""clinical"" concentrations they are competitive H1 receptor antagonists, although large concentrations of some of them exert non-competitive blockade. Daytime drowsiness and weakness are seldom really important, and they restrict patients' activities less than the old antihistamines. Some new antihistamines share with old antihistamines quinidine-like effects on the cardiac conducting tissues, and clinically significant interactions have raised the question of drug safety. This prodysrhythmic effect has also been briefly mentioned in comparisons of non-sedative H1 antihistamines.",I,E
10348091,Comparative tolerability of second generation antihistamines.,Age Factors; Animals; Brain; Cardiovascular System; Central Nervous System; Female; Histamine H1 Antagonists; Humans; Pregnancy,"Horak, F; Stçœ‰bner, U P","Second generation histamine H1 receptor antagonists, the so-called 'nonsedating' antihistamines, have high potency and additional antiallergic properties as well as H1 antagonism and are associated with fewer adverse effects compared with the first generation antihistamines. A number of drugs in this class are approved for use: acrivastine, astemizole, azelastine, cetirizine, ebastine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine and terfenadine. All of them have a more favourable risk-benefit ratio with regard to the CNS adverse effects. Even those second generation antihistamines that are not actually 'nonsedating' are less impairing than their predecessors, but not one of them is entirely devoid of CNS activity. Under certain circumstances some antihistamines may affect cardiac repolarisation resulting in cardiovascular adverse effects. Serious cardiovascular effects have been reported with terfenadine and astemizole when they are used in high dosages or when they are given to 'at risk' patients. Animal models indicate that there might be a potential risk of cardiovascular adverse effects with other antihistamines as well. However, up to now there is no clinical evidence for this assumption, despite some confusing reports. Likewise there has been much discussion about a link between these agents and carcinogenicity. However, there is no evidence that any of the second generation antihistamines increase the risk of tumour growth in humans. Small children, elderly patients and persons with chronic renal or liver impairment are special groups in which the individual adverse effects of the second generation antihistamines must be kept in mind. The dosage for an individual has to be modified with respect to their metabolic situation. Despite the fact that some of the second generation antihistamines are listed in the US Food and Drug Administration pregnancy risk classification as class B, the use of second generation antihistamines should be avoided during pregnancy and they should never be administered to nursing mothers. Taking into account their negligible CNS activity, the low incidence of cardiovascular adverse effects, their lack of anticholinergic effects and other benefits, this class of antiallergic drugs represents a definite advance in therapy.",I,2

Good evidence supports use of antihistamines, nasal steroid sprays, and immunotherapy. Fewer trials have been done on the new antileukotrienes.; Allergic rhinitis causes significant morbidity, which can be successfully treated. Newer antihistamines, developed to replace terfenadine and astemizole which have potential side effects, include loratadine, cetirizine, and the newest, fexofenadine. Intranasal steroid sprays are also effective, particularly for people with nasal stuffiness. One study showed some growth retardation in children using beclomethasone over a prolonged period (1 year). The newer steroid sprays, such as fluticasone, budesonide, and mometasone furoate aqueous, however, have not been studied in the same way and are usually recommended for shorter periods. The newest group of medications showing real promise are the antileukotrienes, including zafirlukast and montelukast. Taken orally, these medications avoid the discomfort of nasal sprays and seem to have few side effects. Immunotherapy offers a new option: a short-course, preseasonal series of six to 11 injections that reduces the burden on patients for year-round therapy. Combinations of these therapies are also possible.; With new medications and immunotherapy options, family physicians can offer effective treatment to patients with allergic rhinitis.",E,E

Patients received cetirizine or loratadine at 0.2 mg/kg once daily in the morning for 28 days. Histamine skin tests and eosinophil counts from nasal smears were performed at baseline and at the end of treatment. Individual rhinitis symptoms were assessed by the investigator at baseline and on day 28 and by parents at baseline and daily in symptom diaries. Global assessments were made by using a visual analog scale at baseline and at the end of treatment. Cetirizine produced significantly greater inhibition of the wheal response compared with loratadine (P <.0001). Eosinophil counts were improved to a comparable degree with both agents. Cetirizine and loratadine produced comparable improvements in symptoms and according to a global evaluation as assessed by the investigator at the end of treatment. Both agents produced substantial symptomatic relief according to patients' daily diary assessments; however, cetirizine was more effective than loratadine in relieving the symptoms of rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal obstruction, and nasal pruritus (P <. 0001). Both treatments were well tolerated; two patients receiving cetirizine were dropped from the study because of adverse events. Cetirizine and loratadine provided effective, well-tolerated relief of the symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis in small children. Cetirizine was more effective than loratadine in inhibiting the wheal response to histamine challenge and afforded greater reductions in most individual symptoms assessed daily by the parent.",I,I

Nasal challenge with histamine led to significant increases in vascular permeability, reflex nasal secretions, sneezing, and other nasal symptoms. Sinus challenge resulted in significant increases in vascular permeability within the sinus cavity (P < 0.01) and some nasal symptoms but no significant change in reflex nasal secretions. The response of the sinus mucosa to histamine was lower in magnitude than that of the nose.

It is rapidly absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of between 40 and 50%. Food increases the absorption by 30 to 80%. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are linear over the clinical dosage range of 200 to 600 mg once daily. The mean elimination half-life ranges from 7.6 to 24 hours, which facilitates a once daily administration regimen. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are similar between patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy individuals. In humans, troglitazone undergoes metabolism by sulfation, glucuronidation and oxidation to form a sulfate conjugate (M1), glucuronide conjugate (M2) and quinone metabolite (M3), respectively. M1 and M3 are the major metabolites in plasma, and M2 is a minor metabolite. Age, gender, type 2 diabetes, renal impairment, smoking and race do not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of troglitazone and its 2 major metabolites. In patients with hepatic impairment the plasma concentrations of troglitazone, M1 and M3 increase by 30%, 4-fold, and 2-fold, respectively. Cholestyramine decreases the absorption of troglitazone by 70%. Troglitazone may enhance the activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and/or transporter(s) thereby reducing the plasma concentrations of terfenadine, cyclosporin, atorvastatin and fexofenadine. It also reduces the plasma concentrations of the oral contraceptive hormones ethinylestradiol, norethindrone and levonorgestrel. Troglitazone does not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, glibenclamide (glyburide) or paracetamol (acetaminophen). There is no pharmacodynamic interaction between troglitazone and warfarin or alcohol (ethanol). Pharmacodynamic modelling showed that improvement in fasting glucose and triglyceride levels increased with dose from 200 to 600 mg. Knowledge of systemic troglitazone exposure within a dose group does not improve the prediction of glucose lowering response or adverse effects beyond those based on the administered dose.",E,E

Both treatments exerted a significant effect. However, cetirizine was significantly more efficient than ebastine 20 mg (P < 0.01 both for wheals and flares). After cetirizine, the threshold concentration inducing a 3-mm(2 )wheal was significantly higher (266 mg/ml) than after ebastine (77 mg/ml) (P < 0.01), and total inhibition of the wheal was obtained in 18 of 24 patients for cetirizine and in 4 of 24 for ebastine (P < 0.001). The variation coefficient for the wheal reaction was 31% for cetirizine and 159% for ebastine, indicating a much lower variability after cetirizine.; Our study shows clearly that the efficacy of a single therapeutic dosage of cetirizine is greater and consistently better than that of ebastine for suppression of cutaneous reactivity to histamine 4 h after treatment in healthy volunteers.

Subjects underwent a chest x-ray, methacholine challenge test, and empiric trial of postnasal drip therapy, and completed daily cough symptom diaries subjectively evaluating cough frequency and severity on a graded scale of 0-4 (combined maximum 8). After excluding other causes of cough, the remaining patients underwent esophageal and pH testing. Those testing positive were randomized to omeprazole 40 mg b.i.d. or placebo for 12 weeks. Follow-up was 1 yr.; A total of 71 patients were screened; 48 were excluded. Twenty-three patients were evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux disease; six (26%) were eventually determined to have an acid-related cough. Of these patients, 17 had a positive pH test, six (35%) of whom showed a striking improvement or resolution of their cough during omeprazole treatment which was sustained for up to 1 yr. Six had a negative pH test, none of whom responded to omeprazole therapy. No significant differences were seen between responders (n = 6) and nonresponders (n = 11) for demographic factors, baseline symptom frequency and duration, or physiological parameters (motility/pH).; Acid-related chronic cough was present in 26% (six of 23) of patients evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux disease.

One grade B trial supported the efficacy of antihistamines in relieving pruritus. All remaining trials (grade C) lacked placebo controls or randomization, or contained fewer than 20 patients in each treatment group.; Although antihistamines are often used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, little objective evidence exists to demonstrate relief of pruritus. The majority of trials are flawed in terms of the sample size or study design. Based on the literature alone, the efficacy of antihistamines remains to be adequately investigated.

Improvements in lung function and reductions in as-needed beta2-agonist usage are apparent within 1 day of initiating montelukast treatment in adults and adolescents (aged > or = 15 years treated with 10 mg/day) or children (aged 6 to 14 years treated with 5 mg/day) with persistent asthma as shown in clinical trials. In two 12-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind studies in adults and adolescents aged > or = 15 years with persistent asthma [forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) = 50 to 85% predicted] there was significantly (p < 0.05) greater improvement in FEV1, symptom scores, peak expiratory flow (PEF), as-needed beta2-agonist use, peripheral eosinophil counts and health-related quality of life (QOL) in patients treated with montelukast 10 mg/day than in recipients of placebo. Improvements were significantly greater in patients treated with inhaled beclomethasone 400 microg/day than in recipients of montelukast 10 mg/day in 1 of these studies. Nonetheless, 42% of montelukast recipients experienced > or = 11% improvement in FEV1, the median improvement in this parameter in beclomethasone-treated patients. In an 8-week multicentre, randomised, double-blind, study in children aged 6 to 14 years with persistent asthma (FEV1 50 to 85% predicted), montelukast 5 mg/day produced significantly greater improvements in FEV1, clinic PEF, as-needed beta2-agonist use, peripheral eosinophil counts, asthma exacerbations and QOL scores than placebo. The combination of montelukast 10 mg/day plus inhaled beclomethasone 200 microg twice daily provided significantly better asthma control than inhaled beclomethasone 200 microg twice daily in adults with poorly controlled asthma (mean FEV1 = 72% predicted) despite 4 weeks treatment with inhaled beclomethasone. Patients receiving the combination experienced significant improvements in FEV1 and morning PEF, significant reductions in daytime symptom scores, as-needed beta2 agonist usage and night-time awakenings with asthma, and had significantly lower peripheral blood eosinophil counts after 16 weeks in this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Among adults (FEV1 > or = 70%) treated with montelukast 10 mg/day for 12 weeks, inhaled corticosteroid dosages were titrated downward by 47% (vs 30% in placebo recipients), 40% of patients were tapered off of inhaled corticosteroids (vs 29%), and significantly fewer patients (16 vs 30%) experienced failed corticosteroid rescues in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study. During clinical studies, the frequency of adverse events in montelukast-treated adults, adolescents and children was similar to that in placebo recipients. In conclusion, montelukast is well tolerated and effective in adults and children aged > or = 6 years with persistent asthma including those with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and/or aspirin sensitivity. Furthermore, montelukast has glucocorticoid sparing properties. Hence, montelukast, as monotherapy in patients with mild persistent asthma, or as an adjunct to inhaled corticosteroids is useful across a broad spectrum of patients with persistent asthma.",E,E

Here, we set out to study the relationship between emedastine pharmacokinetics and the suppressive effect on histamine-induced wheals and flares, and to compare these effects to placebo and cetirizine.; Emedastine (4 mg q.d.), emedastine (2 mg b.i.d.), cetirizine (10 mg q.d.) and placebo were administered to healthy volunteers in a double-blind, cross-over fashion. On day 1 and day 5 (steady state) following drug administration, wheals and flares were induced by skin-prick testing with 1 mg ml(-1) or 10 mg ml(-1) histamine.; Following the administration of 4 mg emedastine q.d., mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)0-24 values of 34.49 +/- 24.07 ng h ml(-1) and 47.05 +/- 36.12 ng h ml(-1) were attained on day 1 and day 5, respectively. Following the administration of emedastine (2 mg b.i.d.) mean AUC0-24 values were 29.75 +/- 19.92 ng h ml(-1) and 46.13 +/- 38.50 ng h ml(-1) on day 1 and day 5, respectively. Histamine-induced wheals and flares were significantly more effectively suppressed by emedastine and cetirizine than placebo. At pharmacokinetic steady-state levels, no significant difference could be found in the potency between cetirizine and emedastine (2 mg b.i.d.).; Emedastine displays pharmacodynamic properties comparable with cetirizine and therefore qualifies as a safe and alternative compound with H1-receptor antagonist properties. Additional larger studies may be needed to substantiate potential benefits of cetirizine over emedastine after single-dose administration.",I,E

Bee venom immunotherapy was started with an ultrarush protocol and patients were randomized to pretreatment with either fexofenadine 180 mg or placebo on days 1, 8, 22, and 50 of the protocol. Local and systemic allergic side-effects were registered.; Fifty-four patients completed the study, 28 on fexofenadine and 26 on placebo pretreatment. On day 1, large local reactions were significantly reduced in both extension and duration by fexofenadine pretreatment (P<0.025). Systemic allergic side-effects on the whole were not reduced. However, the symptoms pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema occurred less frequently with fexofenadine (P<0.05).; Pretreatment with fexofenadine during venom immunotherapy reduces local allergic reactions and generalized symptoms of the urticaria and angioedema type.",E,E

The drugs usually appear to be extensively metabolized,mainly in the liver. Some second generation antihistamines are metabolized principally by the cytochrome P-450 microsomal enzyme system, mainly by the isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), although other isoenzyme,including CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, also may be involved. However,other second generation antihistamines appear to be only minimally metabolized in the liver. Serious cardiac effects (prolongation of the QT interval, arrhythmias, torsades de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, arrest, hypotension, palpitations, syncope, dizziness, and/or death) have been reported rarely in patients receiving terfenadine or astemizole. Cardiotoxic effects ussually were associated with higher than recommended dosages and/or increased plasma concentrations of the drugs and their active metabolites. No clinically important adverse effects or changes in the QT intervals were reported after concomitant administration of ketoconazole with fexofenadine. Patients receiving an azole, antifungal, a macrolide, quinine or grapefruit juice also appear to be at substantial risk of such toxicity, probably secondary to interference with metabolism of the antihistamine. Second-generation H1 receptor antagonist have been studied extensively in the treatment of asthma. Many of these drugs have been reported to inhibit eosinophil and basophil chemotaxis and therefore might have an effect on the inflammatory reactions that characterise this disease. Safe use of antihistamines during pregnancy has not been established; therefore, the drugs should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant unless the potential benefits justify the possible risks to the fetus. Antihistamines should not be administered to premature or full-term neonates. Young children may be more susceptible than adults to the toxic effects of antihistamines.",E,E

Recent research has indicated that not all second-generation antihistamines are comparable with respect to somnolence and other cognitive processes.; Patients aged > or = 12 years and actively exhibiting symptoms of allergic rhinitis were randomized to 2 treatment groups to receive 10 mg loratadine or 10 mg cetirizine daily at 8:00 AM for 1 week. After patients took the medication, their somnolence and degree of motivation to perform activities were recorded in an electronic diary using a visual analog scale 4 times during the workday (8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, noon, and 3:00 PM).; Sixty patients (31 men, 29 women) were randomized to treatment. Somnolence scores were similar for both groups at baseline and at the time of dosing (8:00 AM). However, there was a statistically significant difference in somnolence scores between the loratadine and cetirizine groups at 10:00 AM (P = 0.008), noon (P = 0.001), and 3:00 PM (P < 0.001), with the cetirizine group showing a greater degree of somnolence. The scores on motivation to perform activities were similar for both groups at the baseline and 8:00-AM measurements.

Perennial allergic rhinitis is a disease which causes variable restrictions on the physical, psychological and social aspects of patients' lives. According to the SF-36 questionnaire assessment, quality of life is impaired in these patients. Cetirizine, a potent, reliable histamine H1-receptor antagonist, has already been found to induce significant improvement in the quality of life of patients with chronic rhinitis, as assessed by the same SF-36 questionnaire after 1 and 6 weeks of treatment. This paper further investigates the extent to which cetirizine continues to improve quality of life after a long-term treatment (6 weeks) compared to a shorter treatment (1 week). The analyses show that, despite the significant improvement found after 1 week of treatment with cetirizine compared to placebo, a further 5-week course of therapy not only maintains this improvement but continues to enhance quality of life significantly above and beyond this.",I,E

The skin responses were monitored by measurement of wheal and flare areas.; BK, histamine, and 48/80 induced wheal and flare reactions in all placebo-treated subjects. Histamine elicited larger wheal and flare reactions than BK and 48/80. IDT with BK induced four- to six-fold larger wheal and flare reaction than PT. No differences in BK-induced wheal and flare were observed between atopic and healthy subjects. In atopic subjects, cetirizine induced a significant reduction of flare reactions after the BK test (80% for IDT, and 94% for PT [P<0.01]). Moreover, cetirizine reduced significantly BK-induced wheals by 70% for IDT (P<0.01) and 65% for PT (P<0.01). A similar inhibiting effect of cetirizine was also observed in healthy subjects.; These findings showed that the wheal and flare reactions induced by BK challenge were markedly inhibited by previous intake of cetirizine. The mechanism by which this effect is mediated cannot be established at present.",E,E

Leukapheresis began on day 5 of cytokine administration and continued daily until the target yield was reached, or until a maximum of five leukaphereses had been performed. Compared with the filgrastim-alone group (n = 54), the SCF plus filgrastim group (n = 48) showed an increase in the proportion of patients reaching the target yield within five leukaphereses (44% vs 17%, P = 0.002); reduction in the number of leukaphereses required to reach the target yield (P = 0.003); reduction in the proportion of patients failing to reach a minimum yield of 1 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg to proceed to transplant (16% vs 26%, P = NS); increase in the median yield of CD34+ cells per leukapheresis (0.73 x 10(6)/kg vs 0.48 x 10(6)/kg, P = 0.04); and an increase in the median total CD34+ cells collected within five leukaphereses (3.6 x 10(6)/kg vs 2.4 x 10(6)/kg, P = 0.05). All patients receiving SCF were premedicated (antihistamines and albuterol), and treatment was generally well tolerated. Five patients experienced severe mast cell-mediated reactions, none of which were life-threatening. In this study of heavily pretreated lymphoma patients, SCF plus filgrastim was more effective than filgrastim alone for mobilizing PBPC for harvesting and transplantation after high-dose chemotherapy.",E,E

Pharmacy claims data for a six-month preintervention period at four HMOs were analyzed to identify all new and refill prescriptions for loratadine, fexofenadine, astemizole, and cetirizine. The interventions consisted of a mandatory lockout of loratadine in favor of fexofenadine (at HMO A), a voluntary switch to fexofenadine promoted through letters to both physicians and members (HMO B), and a voluntary switch promoted through letters to physicians only (HMO C). There was no intervention at HMO D. Pharmacy claims data for the six months after each intervention program was implemented were analyzed to determine changes in the market share and prescribing of the study drugs. After the intervention programs were implemented, the market share of fexofenadine increased from 18.9% to 65.2% at HMO A, from 14.8% to 21.0% at HMO B, and from 20.7% to 23.8% at HMO C. Loratadine's market share decreased from 62.3% to 8.7% at HMO A, from 67.5% to 58.6% at HMO B, and from 70.5% to 65.3% at HMO C. HMOs A, B, and C each had greater shifts in market share for fexofenadine and loratadine than the control HMO. Changes in prescribing followed a similar pattern for the 25 physicians at each HMO who had most frequently prescribed loratadine during the preintervention period. The average cost per antihistamine prescription decreased 22.3% at HMO A. Prescription costs continued to rise at HMOs B, C, and D. Mandating the use of fexofenadine produced a significant increase in its market share, reduced the cost of nonsedating antihistamines, and successfully influenced prescribing behavior. Voluntary programs had a more modest impact on market share and did not stop increases in prescription costs.",E,E

This was a double-blind, randomised, crossover, placebo-controlled study involving 24 healthy volunteers (18-65 years) with negative skin prick tests and the absence of specific IgEs to common allergens. Subjects were randomised to receive each of the following treatments once daily for 6 days: ebastine (10 mg), ebastine (20 mg), cetirizine (10 mg) or placebo with a washout period of 5 days. Twenty-four hours after the last dose of each treatment, histamine skin prick tests were performed (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 mg/mL), and wheal and flare responses were measured. All active treatments produced significant inhibition of the wheal responses compared to placebo (P < 0.001). Wheal response inhibition was significantly better with 20 mg of ebastine compared with 10 mg of ebastine and 10 mg of cetirizine. In a comparison to histamine concentrations required to produce a wheal surface area of 10 mm2, 20 mg of ebastine was also significantly better than ebastine 10 mg and cetirizine (P < 0.001), and 10 mg ebastine was significantly better than cetirizine (P < 0.05). Highly significant (P < 0.001) effects on the flare response were observed with each active treatment compared to placebo, with no difference between groups. The frequency of adverse events, primarily somnolence, was similar among the four treatment groups. Our results clearly indicate that ebastine, at either recommended dosage of 10 and 20 mg, and cetirizine produced significant inhibition of the histamine-induced wheal and flare reaction compared to placebo for up to 24 h. A superior efficacy of 20 mg of ebastine is observed compared with 10 mg of ebastine and 10 mg of cetirizine on the skin wheal response 24 h after the last dose of a 6-day-long treatment. This study clearly proves ebastine to be an effective, truly once-daily antihistamine.",E,E

The aim of the study was to determine the effect on bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) assessed at baseline and after 3 years of LNIT or pharmacological treatment alone. Forty-three randomized patients with allergic oculorhinitis were enrolled (26 positive to Graminaceae and 17 to Parietaria judaica pollens). All patients were asked whether they were willing to follow a 3-year treatment course involving preseasonal LNIT with a powder extract of Graminaceae or Parietaria pollens. Twenty-four patients (16 allergic to Graminaceae and eight to Parietaria) selected LNIT and the other 19 opted for symptomatic pharmacological treatment only. The latter was considered the control group. On the basis of positive or negative bronchial hyperresponsiveness and the LNIT, four subgroups were established and followed in open conditions, during which a record was kept of symptom scores, drug use, spirometry and methacholine test findings. After 3 years, patients treated with LNIT had a significant reduction of symptoms and drug intake. In the controls, symptoms worsened, thus requiring more drugs to control them. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness significantly improved in hyperreactive patients receiving LN7IT 10 of whom were no longer hyperreactive and one at a higher threshold. Among controls, bronchial hyperresponsiveness did not change, with the exception of three nonreactive patients who became hyperreactive, one of them with asthma. These findings confirm the efficacy of LNIT in allergic rhinitis suggesting that it might have systemic activity interfering with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and hence the onset of bronchial asthma.",E,E

In each study, subjects received three 10 day treatments in random sequence, separated by a 14 day washout period. The treatments were loratadine alone, cimetidine or ketoconazole alone, or loratadine plus cimetidine or ketoconazole. The primary study endpoint was the difference in mean QTc intervals from baseline to day 10. In addition, plasma concentrations of loratadine, DCL, and ketoconazole or cimetidine were obtained on day 10.; Concomitant administration of loratadine and ketoconazole significantly increased the loratadine plasma concentrations (307%; 90% CI 205-428%) and DCL concentrations (73%; 62-85%) compared with administration of loratadine alone. Concomitant administration of loratadine and cimetidine significantly increased the loratadine plasma concentrations (103% increase; 70-142%) but not DCL concentrations (6% increase; 1-11%) compared with administration of loratadine alone. Cimetidine or ketoconazole plasma concentrations were unaffected by coadministration with loratadine. Despite increased concentrations of loratadine and DCL, there were no statistically significant differences for the primary electrocardiographic repolarization parameter (QTc) among any of the treatment groups. No other clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of loratadine were observed as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (mean (90% CI) QTc changes: loratadine vs loratadine + ketoconazole = 3.6 ms (-2.2, 9.4); loratadine vs loratadine + cimetidine = 3.2 ms (-1.6, 7.9)), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.; Loratadine 10 mg daily was devoid of any effects on electrocardiographic parameters when coadministered for 10 days with therapeutic doses of ketoconazole or cimetidine in healthy volunteers.

Many of them occur in organs that are unconnected to the primary target of pharmacological action. Out of these, cardiac side-effects have drawn particular attention because of their potential to cause death. Starting with the early observations on antibiotics such as macrolides, followed by fluoroquinolones and others, the focus has now shifted to the antihistamine class of drugs which are used extensively by patients all over the world, thanks to the ever increasing levels of environmental pollution. The occurrence of prolonged QTc interval following treatment with terfenadine leading to ventricular tachycardia of torsades de points variety with a potentially fatal outcome has forced many regulatory authorities of the world to clamp a ban the use of this drug. Alerted by these developments, studies on a new member, followed by fluoroquinolones and others, the focus has now shifted to the antihistamine class of drugs which are used extensively by patients all over the world, thanks to the ever incresing levels of envrionmental pollution. The occurrence of prolonged QTc interval following treatment with terfenadine leading to ventricular tachycardia of torsades de points variety with a potentially fatal outcome has forced many regulatory authorities of the world to clamp a ban use of this drug. Alerted by these developments, studies on a new member of non-sedating antihistamine class viz, fexofenadine, have been reviewed especially because of the structural similarity between terfenadine and fexofenadine. It is now clear that despite the closeness of its chemical structure to terfenadine fexofenadine behaves in a different manner and does not affect the electrophysiology of the heart muscle tissue, as proved by data from extensive clinical trials as well as membrane models in vitro. Interestingly, the solitary false alarm that was sounded on the drug by a group of workers in the Netherlands was later rectified by the same group. Clinically speaking, the cardiovascular safety of fexofenadine has been convincingly demonstrated at various dose levels and various time intervals, alone and together with other drugs of potential toxigenicity. All things put together, it appears reasonable to conclude that fexofenadine is free from cardiovascular ADRs of clinical significance. It could also be concluded that cardiac side-effects of antihistamines is not a class effect.",E,E

Pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that cetirizine, a racemate mixture composed of equal amounts of two enantiomers, does not undergo hepatic metabolism to any significant level. The enantiomers are excreted mainly unchanged, predominantly in the urine and to a lesser extent in the faeces.; The pharmacologic activity and potency of the two enantiomers of cetirizine in the management of allergic skin conditions were investigated by studying the effect of treatment with 5.0 mg cetirizine; 2.5 mg levocetirizine, the (R)-enantiomer; and 2.5 mg ucb 28557, the (S)-enantiomer, on histamine-induced wheal and flare response in 18 healthy volunteers. Each treatment was administered as a single oral dose in randomized, double-blind, and crossover manner, and the efficacy of treatment was assessed over a period of 32 h, as per cent inhibition of the histamine-induced wheal and flare areas before treatment. Blood and urine samples were collected in a time-dependent manner and analyzed for the total amounts of each study drug, to elucidate their pharmacokinetic profiles.; Both cetirizine and levocetirizine caused a marked inhibition of histamine-induced wheal and flare, whereas ucb 28557 was inactive in this model. Inhibition of the wheal response observed for cetirizine and levocetirizine was apparent by 1 h after dosage and lasted for mean durations of 24.4 and 28.4 h, respectively. In addition, the response for cetirizine and levocetirizine became maximal by 6 h after treatment, rising to 79.5% and 83.8%. Similarly, cetirizine and levocetirizine also markedly inhibited the histamine-induced flare response. This effect was evident for both drugs by 1 h after dosage and lasted over a mean period of 28.4 and 26.0 h, respectively, for cetirizine and levocetirizine. The inhibitory effect of these compounds on histamine-induced flare response was also maximal by approximately 6 h after dosage, peaking at 88.5%) and 83.6%, respectively. Statistical evaluation showed that cetirizine and levocetirizine were equivalent for maximum inhibition of histamine-induced wheal and flare. However, levocetirizine was found to be superior to cetirizine when area under the curve was compared. In contrast, ucb 28557 was not found to inhibit histamine-induced wheal and flare responses at any time during the study period. Plasma concentrations of levocetirizine were found to be approximately double those of ucb 28557 at 4 and 8 h after dosing, and 50-60% of the drugs were excreted unchanged in urine over a period of 32 h.; The finding that, in this model, levocetirizine 2.5 mg has comparable antihistaminic activity to cetirizine 5 mg, whereas its other enantiomer ucb 28557 has no pharmacodynamic effect, suggests that the antihistaminic properties of cetirizine observed in the management of allergic skin conditions are likely to be attributable to levocetirizine.",I,E

Substantial clinical trial data provide a rationale for dual-control therapy supported by basic scientific data. Another combined therapy is inhaled steroids plus leukotriene-receptor antagonists, which provides the patient with two effective therapies.

Hence, new treatment options are needed. Desloratadine is a new, potent, nonsedating antihistamine that has an excellent cardiovascular safety profile.; This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of desloratadine in the treatment of moderate-to-severe CIU.

Twice daily, patients rated the severity of CIU symptoms (pruritus, number of hives, and size of largest hive), as well as the impact of CIU symptoms on sleep and daily activity. Patients and investigators jointly evaluated therapeutic response and overall condition. Safety evaluations included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, and changes from baseline in vital signs, laboratory parameters, and ECG intervals.; Desloratadine was superior to placebo in controlling pruritus and total symptoms after the first dose and maintained this superiority to the end of the study.

Four hours after a single oral intake, all subjects were challenged by nasal aerosol application with increasing doubling concentrations (from 0.25 to 32 mg/ml) of histamine in both nostrils. Nasal resistance was measured by passive anterior rhinomanometry (PAR), and changes in histamine threshold were calculated together with the absolute number of sneezes after each challenge.; Both levocetirizine and cetirizine significantly attenuated the histamine-induced increase in nasal airway resistance by nearly 50% (from a median resistance of 2.51 Pa per cm3/s to 1.29 and 1.31 Pa per cm3/s, respectively) at the maximal concentration, and they concomitantly increased the histamine threshold by fourfold (from 8 to 32 mg/ml), compared with placebo. Sneezing was also attenuated by both levocetirizine and cetirizine. However, these antihistaminic effects were not seen with dextrocetirizine.; This study shows a similar activity of levocetirizine and cetirizine on the inhibition of histamine-induced increase in nasal resistance, indicating that the antihistaminic properties of cetirizine are probably attributable to levocetirizine.",E,E

The corresponding ratios for 3-hydroxydesloratadine were 115% (90% CI, 98-136) and 104% (90% CI, 88-122), respectively. A substantial increase was observed in mean Cmax and AUC values for fexofenadine when administered with azithromycin: Cmax, ratio, 169% (90% CI, 120-237); AUC ratio, 167% (90% CI, 122-229). Compared with the group receiving desloratadine and azithromycin, subjects receiving fexofenadine and azithromycin also displayed greater variability in pharmacokinetic parameters for the antihistamine. Mean Cmax and AUC values of azithromycin were slightly higher when administered with desloratadine (Cmax ratio, 131% [90% CI, 92-187]; AUC ratio, 112% [90% CI, 83-153]) but were lower when given in combination with fexofenadine (Cmax ratio, 87% [90% CI, 61-124]; AUC ratio, 88% [90% CI, 65-1201). The most common adverse event for all regimens was headache, reported in 20 (22%) subjects.

By contrast, peak fexofenadine concentrations were increased by 69% and the AUC was increased by 67% in the presence of the azalide antibiotic. Based on the reported adverse-events profile and the absence of changes in ECG parameters, the combination of desloratadine and azithromycin was well tolerated.

Outcome data derived from questionnaires returned by general practitioners (GPs) in England between March and August 1997.; Of the 35,817 questionnaires sent, 18,238 (50.9%) were returned, of which 16,638 contained useful data. These included 40% male (mean age 36+/-19 years) and 59% female (mean age 39+/-19 years). Most common indications were allergic rhinitis (55%), not specified (28%), urticaria, pruritus or rash (10%) and other indications (7%). There were 40 reports of adverse drug reactions in 27 patients. Less than 2% of patients stopped the drug because of side effects. Events reported after exposure to fexofenadine were uncommon and already reported in clinical trials. There were eight reports of possible cardiac side effects (palpitations, three; chest pain, three; arrhythmia, one; and chest tightness, one). None was felt to be serious. There were no drug interactions reported. None of the 30 deaths was related to fexofenadine.

An additional objective was also to investigate the configurational stability of levocetirizine in vivo in humans. The study was performed in a randomized, two-way cross-over, single-dose design with a wash-out phase of 7 days between the two periods. A total of 12 healthy male and 12 healthy female volunteers were included in the study. Bioequivalence can be concluded from the analysis of the pharmacokinetic parameters of levocetirizine when administered alone or as the racemate cetirizine. No chiral inversion occurs in humans when levocetirizine is administered, i.e. there is no formation of the distomer. When comparing the pharmacokinetic characteristics of levocetirizine and the distomer, the apparent volume of distribution of the eutomer is significantly smaller than that of the distomer (0.41 and 0.60 L/kg, respectively). For an H1-antagonist a small distribution volume can be considered as a positive aspect, both in terms of efficacy and safety. Moreover the non-renal clearance of levocetirizine is also significantly lower than that of the distomer (9.70 and 28.70 mL/min, respectively), which constitutes an additional positive aspect particularly as far as metabolism-based drug interactions are concerned. The information collected in the present study on the pharmacokinetics of levocetirizine and the distomer provide additional reasons for eliminating the distomer and developing levocetirizine as an improvement on cetirizine.",E,E

First-generation antihistamines are rarely used in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, mainly because of sedative and anticholinergic adverse effects. On the basis of clinical evidence of efficacy, no second-generation antihistamine seems preferable to another. Similarly, comparisons of topical and oral antihistamines have been unable to demonstrate superior efficacy for one method of administration over the other. Current data documents no striking differences in efficacy and safety parameters between intranasal corticosteroids. When the efficacy of antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids are compared in patients with allergic rhinitis, present data favours intranasal corticosteroids. Interestingly, data do not show antihistamines as superior for the treatment of conjunctivitis. Safety data from comparative studies in patients with allergic rhinitis do not indicate differences between antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids. Combining antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids in the treatment of allergic rhinitis does not provide any additional effect to intranasal corticosteroids alone.

This article reports the negative results of a clinical trial with loratadine, a second-generation antihistamine, in adults in the rhinovirus challenge model. This finding in the highly controlled setting of the challenge model confirms the earlier negative studies with second-generation antihistamines in natural colds. First-generation antihistamines block both histaminic and muscarinic receptors as well as passing the blood-brain barrier. Second-generation antihistamines mainly block histaminic receptors and do not pass the blood-brain barrier. The effectiveness of first-generation antihistamines in blocking sneezing in colds may be due primarily to neuropharmacological manipulation of histaminic and muscarinic receptors in the medulla.",I,I

Such causality assessments are sometimes done by drug de-challenge and re-challenge. When the adverse effect is potentially serious, there is clearly an important decision to be made as to whether the re-challenge is justifiable and hence ethical. The recent controversy about the potential cardiotoxicity of fexofenadine, the fatalities associated with penicillin re-challenge and the fatalities associated with abacavir re-challenge highlight some of the potential serious risks of drug re-challenge. The associated important ethical issues are discussed. In particular, there is the need to ensure respect for the patient and to consider the scientific and social value of the re-challenge. A framework for evaluating and assessing the appropriateness of a particular drug re-challenge is proposed in the light of recent as well as long-standing discussions of drug re-challenge, patient informed consent and the ethics of human experimentation, in general. It is suggested that a drug re-challenge should be approached with the same rigour and standards of documentation as are currently required of clinical trials. Given the potential conflicts of interest inherent with any drug study, it is argued that the safeguards, as may be provided by scrutiny by an ethics committee, are necessary for a drug re-challenge. For the investigator contemplating the conduct of a drug re-challenge we would recommend the following: (i) a careful risk-benefit assessment as part of the decision-making process; (ii) careful scientific preparation, including appropriate expert support and emergency back-up facilities, if re-challenge is deemed necessary; (iii) the writing of a detailed protocol for independent approval and for safeguarding all concerned; and (iv) meticulous record keeping.",E,E

An evidence-based evaluation of antihistamines.,Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic; Evidence-Based Medicine; Histamine H1 Antagonists; Humans; Treatment Outcome; Urticaria,"Lee, E E; Maibach, H I","Urticaria is a cutaneous syndrome characterized by dermal edema (wheal) and erythema (flare) that blanches with pressure. The lesions typically last less than 24 hours and are usually pruritic. In 1983, Christensen and Maibach summarized the theory behind the use of histamine H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines) in clinical dermatology. These agents remain the mainstay of treatment for urticaria. This article reviews the medical literature on the effectiveness of antihistamines in urticarial syndromes, including acute, chronic idiopathic and the physical urticarias. Older antihistamines, such as chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine, are effective in the treatment of urticarias, but they also have marked sedative and anticholinergic effects. Newer nonsedating antihistamines (second-generation antihistamines) have been developed that have reduced adverse effects because they do not cross the blood-brain barrier; these agents (acrivastine, cetirizine, loratadine, mizolastine, fexofenadine, ebastine, azelastine and epinastine) cause significantly less sedation and psychomotor impairment than their older counterparts. A review of the literature reveals that there are few studies which document the efficacy of second-generation antihistamines in the treatment of acute urticaria, a biologic entity that usually resolves within 3 weeks. We did not identify controlled studies that suggested superiority of any antihistamine in the treatment of acute urticaria. Loratadine or cetirizine, and possibly mizolastine, appear to be treatments of choice for chronic idiopathic urticaria. For symptomatic dermatographism, the combination of an antihistamine and an H2 antagonist, e.g. chlorpheniramine and cimetidine, appears to be effective. Very few studies have been conducted on the use of antihistamines in the treatment of cold, cholinergic, and pressure urticaria. Antihistamines are the mainstay of urticarial therapy. This evidence-based review suggests that there are efficacy differences between newer, nonsedating antihistamines and older agents in some forms of the disorder. Clearly, further well-controlled clinical trials in larger numbers of patients are needed to clarify the role of these agents in the treatment of urticaria.",E,E

Levocetirizine was rapidly and extensively absorbed: 85.4% and 12.9% of the radioactive dose were recovered 168 h post-dose in urine and faeces, respectively. Levocetirizine and/or its metabolites were not, or only very poorly, associated with blood cells, as the blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.51 to 0.68.

Although H1 and H2 receptor antagonists are used in the treatment of anaphylaxis, there have been reports implicating these drugs in the genesis of dysrhythmias. This study was designed to investigate the effects of the selective H1 and H2 receptor antagonists loratadine and ranitidine on physiologic autonomic control of the healthy cardiovascular system.; Using a double-blind, crossover design, 14 healthy volunteers completed the protocol and were randomized to receive one dose of loratadine (20 mg), ranitidine (300 mg), or placebo on each of three separate testing sessions. Continuous electrocardiogram and BP recordings were obtained before and 3 h after administration of study drug. Effects on cardiac autonomic control were quantified using power spectral analysis of heart rate variability and calculation of spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity.; Neither placebo nor loratadine significantly altered indices of autonomic cardiovascular control. Conversely, H2 antagonism with ranitidine resulted in a 23.3% decrease in baroreflex sensitivity (P < 0.05) and a corresponding 25.0% decrease in the ratio of high frequency to total power of heart rate variability, both indices of parasympathetic modulation (P < 0.01). Furthermore, ranitidine evoked a concomitant 103.8% increase in the ratio of low to high frequency power of heart rate variability, an index of sympathetic control (P < 0.01).; H1 receptor antagonism with loratadine does not influence physiologic cardiovascular control in young healthy subjects. However, the altered cardiac sympathovagal balance after oral administration of the H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine indicates a shift toward sympathetic predominance in heart rate control. The authors postulate that this could have implications regarding susceptibility to arrhythmias in conditions of heightened sympathetic stimulation.",E,E

The study included 36 healthy volunteers (18--50 years, mean age = 32 years; 9 males). The objective measurement was the cutaneous reactivity to increasing concentrations of histamine (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 mg ml(-1)) administered by prick tests. The reactivity was evaluated by the wheal and flare areas (mm2). The AUC (area under curves) values of the wheal and flare areas as a function of the log2 transformed histamine concentration were calculated for each subject and treatment, and compared.; A highly significant treatment effect was evidenced both for wheal and flare responses (P = 0.0001). This indicates the good activity of both cetirizine 10 mg and mizolastine 10 mg in inhibiting skin wheal and flare reactions to histamine. In addition, the mean AUC values significantly differed between cetirizine and mizolastine (64.8 and 117.8 log2 (mg ml(-1)) x mm2 for wheal, and 939.4 and 2340.8 for flare, respectively; P = 0.0001), with a superior activity of cetirizine than mizolastine at 24 h after intake both on wheal and flare responses. The tolerance of cetirizine and mizolastine was good. The severity of the adverse events was never more than 'moderate', 'fatigue' being the most frequent reported symptom [cetirizine (6 subjects), placebo (3), mizolastine (5)], followed by 'somnolence' [cetirizine (0), placebo (1), mizolastine (3)].

In children aged 6 to 14 years montelukast (5 mg/day) treatment resulted in a significant increase in FEV(1) (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, primary clinical outcome) during an 8-week randomized, double-blind trial. Moreover, significant improvements were observed for a range of secondary endpoints assessing symptoms, exacerbation rates, beta-agonist usage and quality of life. Concomitant administration of montelukast (5 mg/day) and inhaled budesonide (200 microg twice daily) resulted in a trend towards an increase in FEV(1) (p = 0.06, primary endpoint) and a statistically significant reduction in both as-needed beta(2)-agonist usage and the percentage of days with asthma exacerbations compared with budesonide plus placebo. No significant differences were observed in asthma-related quality of life between the two groups. During clinical trials both improvements in lung function and reductions in as-needed beta(2)-agonist usage were generally observed within 1 day after initiation of therapy in children 2 to 14 years of age with persistent asthma. Data from a randomized, nonblind trial in 6- to 11-year-old children and a 6-month extension to this trial suggest that both compliance to therapy and patient satisfaction are greater for montelukast than for either inhaled sodium cromoglycate or inhaled beclomethasone. In addition, patients and parents preferred oral montelukast over sodium cromoglycate. In 2- to 5-year-old children with persistent asthma, montelukast (4 mg/day) treatment resulted in significant improvements in a range of outcomes, such as as-needed beta(2)-agonist usage, symptom scores and percentage of days with asthma symptoms, as assessed during a randomized, double-blind trial primarily designed to assess tolerability. Data from small randomized, double-blind trials suggest that montelukast reduces exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in 6- to 14-year-old children. Montelukast is generally well tolerated. The frequency of adverse events in montelukast-treated children of all ages was comparable to that in patients receiving placebo.; Oral montelukast has shown efficacy as a preventive treatment for asthma during clinical trials in children aged 2 to 14 years. The drug offers benefits over more standard therapies such as inhaled sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil in terms of compliance and convenience. In addition, the drug offers significant benefits when added to inhaled corticosteroids (according to secondary endpoints).

The prolongation of the QT-interval is caused by the blockade of one or more of the cardiac potassium channels, among which the delayed rectifier I(Kr), encoded by the HERG-gene, appears to be the most significant. The potency of the prokinetic drug cisapride to block I(Kr) appears to be similar to that of terfenadine (IC(50) about 50 nmol/l). These drugs cause problems when overdosed, used in combination with inhibitors of their CYP3A4-mediated metabolism, or when given to individuals with altered drug kinetics (the aged) or patients with existing cardiac disease (congenitally long QT). Moreover, interactions with other QT-interval prolonging drugs require special attention. Active hydrophilic metabolites of the second-generation antihistaminic compounds (ebastine-carebastine, loratadine-desloratadine, terfenadine-fexofenadine, astemizole-norastemizole) are new compounds with probably reduced risk for drug interactions and cardiac toxicity.",I,E

The treatment of atopic dermatitis requires topical corticosteroids, emollients, systemic antihistamine as well as avoidance of the precipitating factors. A double blind multicenter placebo controlled study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of topical mometasone furoate 0.1 per cent cream in combination with loratadine syrup. Forty-eight patients, 23 boys and 25 girls, mean age 73.67 months, with atopic dermatitis were included in the study. The severity of the disease was measured by using the SCORAD index including the degree of erythema, dryness, edema/papulation, oozing/crusting, lichenification, and excoriation. Total area involved was measured and a target area of dermatitis was selected for specific evaluation. The degree of clinical signs and pruritic symptom was graded. The sensation of pruritus, disturbance of sleep due to pruritus, and feeling of sleepiness in the morning were recorded. Mometasone furoate 0.1 per cent cream was applied to all patients once daily. One group received loratadine syrup and another group received placebo syrup. They were followed-up on day 5, 8 and 15. The severity of atopic dermatitis and pruritus significantly decreased after 14 days of treatment in both groups (p < 0.001). There was no difference in therapeutic response between the loratadine and placebo groups (p = 0.99). All signs examined had decreased by the end of the study. The result demonstrated that 0.1 per cent mometasone therapy is very effective for treating childhood atopic dermatitis. Loratadine did not show beneficial effect when combined with good topical corticosteroid but it was safe and had no serious side effect on the children.",E,E

Well-validated and standardized measures of behavior (Behavior Screening Questionnaire) and cognition (McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities) were used. In addition, the ages of attainment of psychomotor milestones were established. These measures were taken between an average of 32 and 53 mo of age, both during the study treatment with cetirizine or placebo and after the study treatment had been discontinued. The Behavior Screening Questionnaire was completed at least once on approximately 300 children in each group and on approximately 200 children on five occasions. The McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities were administered to approximately 100 in each group at three different times. There were no significant differences between the cetirizine and placebo groups on either of the behavior and cognition measures or in psychomotor milestones during or after the study treatment. These findings suggest that there are no adverse effects on behavior or learning processes associated with the prolonged use of cetirizine in young children with atopic dermatitis.",E,E

Histamine skin challenges (prick test) were evaluated before and at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hr after drug intake by measuring the wheal and flare area (studies 1 and 2) along with laser Doppler monitoring of the microvascular responses (study 2). A decrease in wheal and flare areas was observed following intake of both drugs compared with placebo controls. With the notable exception of 1 hr post dose wheal values, which were consistently smaller after epinastine, cetirizine was superior to epinastine for both wheal and flare at all other times. At the prick test site, treatment with epinastine and cetirizine accentuated the increase in blood flow induced by histamine. This reflects the decrease of the whealing but there was no significant difference between the two active test compounds. At 1 cm from the prick test site, the administration of both active treatments inhibited the increase of blood flow, and cetirizine showed a more potent inhibitory effect from 8 hr post dose. This reflects the reduction of the flare induced after histamine-receptor activation of the axon reflex. In conclusion, epinastine shows a rapidly greater (within 1 hr post dose on the wheal only) but vanishing effect than cetirizine. At all other time points, cetirizine was generally more effective than epinastine.",I,E

Neurons producing histamine, histaminergic neurons, are exclusively located in the posterior hypothalamus and transmit histamine to almost all regions of the brain. Histamine H1 antagonists, or antihistamines, often prescribed for treatment of allergic disorders, sometimes induce sleepiness and cognitive deficits. It is understood that the mechanism of such CNS side effects is that antihistamine blocks H1Rs in the brain. The purpose of the present study was to compare the CNS side effects of different antihistamines. Subjective sleepiness was measured using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and psychomotor performance was examined by a tachistoscope testing system in healthy, young, Japanese volunteers (16 males, 20-28 yrs.) before and after oral administration of antihistamines such as fexofenadine (FEX) and cetirizine (CET). Additionally, H1R occupancy by antihistamines was examined by PET with 11C-doxepin in 8 volunteers. The results of SSS and psychomotor tests demonstrated that FEX tended to be less sedative than CET though the difference was not statistically significant. PET measurements revealed that no H1Rs in the cerebral cortex were occupied by FEX while about 30% of H1Rs were occupied by CET. In summary, it was confirmed that histamine and H1Rs are involved in maintaining arousal and cognition in humans, and that the severity of clinical symptoms is correlated to the amount of antihistamine that penetrated into the brain.",E,E

Subset analysis demonstrated the number of CD38(-), CD33(-), and CD133(+) peaked at day 11; and CD34(+), CD90(+) cells peaked at day 10. The optimum day for leukapheresis was determined to be day 11. The median absolute peripheral blood CD34(+) cell numbers on day 11 was 665 x 10(6)/l (range: 76-1481 x 10(6)/l). Eight of the 10 heavily pretreated patients were evaluable: three achieved the target dose in one leukapheresis (37.5%) and three (37.5%) achieved the target dose with two leukaphereses. Use of this mobilization strategy allowed the collection of high numbers of CD34(+) cells and early progenitors and the ability to predictably schedule leukapheresis.",E,E

Yet, if OTC doses are effective for treating mild symptoms, why weren't these low, often safer doses made available at least by prescription when the drugs were first approved?; To examine issues surrounding the delayed approval of OTC doses by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).; Information reviewed included package inserts, data obtained from manufacturers, and articles published in MEDLINE (1966 to December 2001). Medications examined included presently available and potentially approved OTC antiinflammatory, gastrointestinal, and antihistamine drugs.; Considerable data demonstrate the effectiveness of ibuprofen, naproxen, ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine, diphenhydramine, and clemastine at OTC doses. Published studies also show the effectiveness of celecoxib, omeprazole, and fexofenadine at doses 33-50% lower than currently recommended for prescription use.; OTC doses are effective for many patients with mild symptoms and for some with serious symptoms. However, OTC-like doses are usually not offered when drugs are approved for prescription use because new drugs are usually studied in patients with serious conditions requiring higher doses; manufacturers and the FDA seem to prefer a middle-dose approach; >75% of subjects in premarketing dose studies are male; and averaging the responses of study subjects may obscure a wide range of interindividual variation in drug response. Simplistic dosage guidelines make therapeutic decisions easier. Because dose-related adverse effects frequently diminish quality-of-life and reduce adherence, the early availability of OTC-like doses, at least by prescription, would allow healthcare professionals greater flexibility in matching medication doses to patients' widely differing needs.",E,E

Subjective evaluation of sickness symptoms was based on the Graybiel diagnostic criteria of acute motion sickness, Golding's scale, and the Coriolis Sickness Susceptibility Index.; Repeated measures ANOVA and Friedman nonparametric ANOVA of rank tests revealed that there were significant differences in symptom assessments based on Graybiel's diagnostic criteria (p < or = 0.001), subjective symptoms of motion sickness (p < or = 0.001), and state-anxiety (p < or = 0.001) before and after motion exposure. However, there are no significant differences between the baseline susceptibility to motion sickness and treatment with placebo, cetirizine, or fexofenadine.; The failure of the second-generation antihistamines cetirizine and fexofenadine to prevent motion sickness suggests that the therapeutic actions of this class of antihistamines against motion sickness may be mediated through central versus peripheral receptors.

Eleven hemodialysis patients with a history of pruritus participated in this study,10 healthy volunteers served as control group.; Histamine and serotonin values were normal in patients and controls. Treatment with cetirizine did not significantly reduce histamine levels in patients or in controls. Tropisetron and ondansetron likewise did not alter serotonin levels in patients. Tropisetron treatment did not significantly change serotonin levels in controls.; Histamine and serotonin are no major mediators of pruritus in hemodialysis patients. Elevated histamine levels are occassionally seen and may be due to the increased mast cell number found in a subgroup of hemodialysis patients. Our findings explain the only marginal relief of antihistamines and the controversial antipruritic effect of serotonin receptor antagonists in hemodialysis-related pruritus.",E,E

A selegiline transdermal system (STS) has been developed with unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that allow inhibition of central nervous system MAO-A and MAO-B enzymes while substantially avoiding inhibition of intestinal and liver MAO-A enzyme. This novel transdermal system provides targeted MAO inhibition without clinically significant increases in sensitivity to dietary tyramine. We investigated the safety and efficacy of STS in patients with major depressive disorder.; 365 outpatients 18 to 65 years old with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder were enrolled at 16 sites. A 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) score of > or = 20 was required for entry. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either STS, 20 mg/20 cm(2), daily or placebo patch for up to 8 weeks. A tyramine-restricted diet was neither required nor advised. Efficacy, safety, and vital sign measures were obtained regularly.; 289 patients were randomly assigned to treatment and received at least 1 on-therapy evaluation (STS, N = 145; placebo, N = 144). Although the effect size was modest, at endpoint, STS was statistically superior to placebo on the MADRS (p =.001) and HAM-D-28 (p =.039) ratings and showed a nonsignificant superiority on the HAM-D-17 (p =.069) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity ratings (p <.055).

In AERD patients treated with ASA 650 BID for at least a year, 115/172 (67%) improved in their clinical courses while decreasing systemic and topical corticosteroids. Sixteen failed to improve, 24 stopped ASA because of intractable side effects (gastritis or hives) and 17 patients discontinued ASA treatment in the first year of study for unrelated reasons. Therefore, treatment with daily ASA is a significant therapeutic option for patients afflicted with AERD. It should be used for AERD patients who do not respond to topical corticosteroids and leukotriene modifier drugs.

A serologic mediator of whealing has been demonstrated in 50-60% of patients with chronic urticaria, and autoantibodies against the high affinity IgE receptor or IgE have been detected in about half of these patients. The demonstration that chronic urticaria is frequently autoimmune has encouraged a more aggressive therapeutic approach, with the use of immunomodulatory drugs.A step-by-step approach to the management of chronic urticaria is proposed, based on our personal experience and review of current medical literature, identified through Medline research and hand searching in medical journals. The non- or low-sedating H(1) receptor antagonists (antihistamines), such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine and, more recently, levocetirizine, desloratadine and ebastine, represent the basic therapy for all chronic urticaria patients. Older sedating antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine, may be indicated if symptoms are severe, are associated with angioedema, and if the patient is anxious and disturbed at night.Corticosteroid therapy with prednisone or methylprednisolone can be administered for a few days (7-14) if urticarial symptoms are not controlled by antihistamines and a rapid clinical response is needed. In cases of relapse after corticosteroid suspension, leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast and zafirlukast, should be tried. In our experience, remission of urticarial symptoms can be achieved in 20-50% of chronic urticaria patients unresponsive to antihistamines alone. When urticaria is unremitting and is not controlled by combined therapy with antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists, prolonged corticosteroid therapy may be needed. Long-term corticosteroid therapy should be administered at the lowest dose able to control urticarial symptoms, in order to minimize adverse effects. In a few patients, however, high-dose corticosteroid therapy may have to be administered for long periods. In these patients, immunosuppressive treatment with low-dose cyclosporine can be started. This type of treatment has a corticosteroid-sparing effect and is also generally effective in patients with severe, unremitting urticaria, but requires careful monitoring of cyclosporine plasma concentration and possible adverse effects. Other immunomodulating drugs that have been tried in chronic urticaria patients include hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, sulfasalazine and methotrexate, but their efficacy has not been proven in large controlled studies. Warfarin therapy may also be considered in some patients with chronic urticaria and angioedema unresponsive to antihistamines.",I,E

Antihistamines are needed that cause no disruptive effects on cognitive and psychomotor function. It is essential that antihistamines maintain the integrity of the cognitive system, not only in ambulatory patients at increased risk of drug-induced traffic- or work-related accidents, but also in students and others whose cognitive or intellectual impairment may adversely affect their performance.Objective; The goal of this study was to investigate the acute effects of fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg, alone and with a ""social"" dose of alcohol, on subjective feelings of sedation and on a battery of objective measures related to driving a car. These measures included information processing, psychomotor speed, and reaction time in an on-the-road car-driving task. Hydroxyzine hydrochloride 50 mg was included in the study as a positive internal control to validate the sensitivity of the psychometri tests to nonspecific impairment.; In this randomized, double-blind, 6-way, crossover study conducted at the Human Psychopharmacology Research Unit, Medical Research Centre (University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom), 18 healthy volunteers received fexofenadine 180 mg, hydroxyzine 50 mg, and placebo alone and with alcohol (0.3 g/kg body weight or approximately 0.43-0.50 g/L blood-alcohol concentration). Treatment periods were separated by a washout period of at least 6 days. Subjects performed tests of cognitive and psychomotor performance at 1, 3, and 5 and hours after dosing. The test battery included subjective ratings of sedation, critical flicker fusion (CFF), choice reaction time (including recognition reaction time [RRT], motor reaction time [MRT], total reaction time [TRT], and brake reaction time [BRT].; Eighteen healthy male volunteers (median age, 30.5 years [range, 23-44 years]) were entered into the study. Fexofenadine alone and with alcohol had no significant effect on performance compared with placebo and was not distinguishable from placebo in any of the objective or subjective tests at any point. However, impairment was evident following the administration of hydroxyzine. Hydroxyzine caused significant impairment in CFF (P < 0.05), RRT (P < 0.001), and TRT (P < 0.001) compared with placebo. Hydroxyzine with alcohol significantly disrupted performance on all of the above measures with respect to both placebo and fexofenadine (P < 0.05) as well as MRT (P < 0.001). No significant treatment effects on BRT were found.; Fexofenadine 180 mg did not have disruptive effects on objective measures related to driving a car and aspects of psychomotor and cognitive function, even when combined with a dose of alcohol equivalent to 0.3 g/kg body weight, in a study in which the psychometric assessments were shown to be sensitive to impairment.",I,E

The primary objective of this study was to determine whether levocetirizine (Xyzal(R)), the active enantiomer of cetirizine, could achieve at least a 50% improvement in PAR symptoms compared to the placebo over the first week of treatment.; A total of 294 patients with PAR due to house dust mites were randomized in this 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial to receive either levocetirizine 5 mg/day or placebo. Mean Total Four-Symptom Scores (T4SS) (nasal pruritus, ocular pruritus, rhinorrhoea and sneezing) were compared between treatment groups over weeks 1, 4 and 6. All individual symptom scores, including nasal congestion, were also studied.; Levocetirizine showed an 86% improvement in T4SS over the first week of treatment and a 47% improvement over the entire treatment period compared with placebo. Absolute changes from baseline were 3.64 and 2.47 for levocetirizine and placebo, respectively. Individual symptom scores showed statistically significant (P < or = 0.01) differences in favour of levocetirizine for all study time-points. Nasal congestion was unexpectedly significantly improved (P < 0.001).

In response to the availability of an OTC non-sedating antihistamine, many managed care organizations are reevaluating which if any prescription antihistamines should remain on formulary. From a managed care perspective, determining which of the remaining prescription antihistamines results in the greatest patient satisfaction with allergy treatment would be informative.; We report on a weighted cross sectional survey (n = 10,023) delivered online to a sample of allergy sufferers in the U.S. during the month of December 2002. Two segments were identified for analysis: patient who were dissatisfied with loratadine and converted to desloratadine (Clarinex; n = 61), and patients who were dissatisfied with loratadine and converted to fexofenadine (Allegra; n = 211). The two segments were compared along a series of measures that the literature suggests are related to treatment satisfaction.; The survey found that two of the satisfaction measures differentiated desloratadine converters from fexofenadine converters (p <.05): mean sum of self-reported adverse events and nighttime awakening due to allergy symptoms. For the remainder of satisfaction measures though, patients who were dissatisfied with loratadine reported equal duration of coverage and satisfaction with desloratadine as fexofenadine. When severity of disease was controlled for in the analysis, a pattern emerged suggesting greater levels of satisfaction amongst loratadine dissatisfied patients who converted to desloratadine. Point estimates suggest a consistent pattern favoring desloratadine patient satisfaction, with statistically significant results reported for sum of adverse effects, nighttime awakening due to symptoms, symptom severity just prior to the next dose, and overall satisfaction (p < 0.05).; On average, patients who were dissatisfied with loratadine reported equal or better satisfaction with desloratadine as fexofenadine. Patients with severe allergic rhinitis reported greater satisfaction when converted from loratadine to desloratadine than fexofenadine for select satisfaction measures. These results suggest that if managed care intends to position prescription antihistamines as second line for OTC loratadine treatment dissatisfaction, desloratadine is a useful treatment alternative. These findings, while informative to formulary decision-makers, must be interpreted with caution. Only through head-to-head controlled clinical trials can differences in efficacy and safety be established.",I,2

Desloratadine is a systemic antihistamine indicated for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis.; The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of ketotifen 0.025% ophthalmic solution instilled in the eye, desloratadine 5-mg tablets taken orally, and their combination for prevention of the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, as induced by the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model.; This was a randomized, double-masked, placebo- and active-controlled, single-center clinical trial. At visit l, the dose of allergen necessary to elicit a qualifying allergic reaction was determined for subjects meeting the entry criteria. At visit 2, the allergen dose determined at visit 1 was confirmed, and all subjects who had a qualifying ocular and nasal allergic reaction were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: ketotifen ophthalmic solution and placebo tablet, desloratadine tablet and placebo eyedrop, or ketotifen and desloratadine. Subjects were instructed to instill 1 drop into each eye twice daily and take 1 tablet with water once daily at the same time as the morning eyedrop for approximately 4 weeks. At visit 3, subjects brought in their medication and were given 1 drop of the eyedrop bilaterally and 1 tablet with water. Bilateral CAC was performed 2 hours after administration of medication. Using standardized scales, subjects rated ocular itching at 3, 5, and 7 minutes after CAC; ocular tearing and eyelid swelling at 10, 15, and 20 minutes after CAC; and nasal signs and symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea and postnasal drip, pruritus, and nasal congestion) at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes after CAC. The investigator graded ocular redness and chemosis at 10, 15, and 20 minutes after CAC. At all visits, subjects were offered an anti-allergy eyedrop to relieve any immediate ocular discomfort caused by CAC.; One hundred two subjects were screened-82 (55 women, 27 men; mean age, 42.8 years [range, 21-70 years]) were randomized to treatment, and 80 completed the study. Subjects in the group that received ketotifen (n = 27) and the group that received ketotifen with desloratadine (n = 26) had significantly lower mean itching scores compared with those in the group that received desloratadine alone (n = 27) at all time points (P </= 0.05). Total ocular redness, calculated by summing the mean redness scores for each of the 3 vessel beds, was significantly lower in the ketotifen group than in the other treatment groups at most time points (P </= 0.05). All treatments attenuated nasal symptoms; no statistically significant differences were noted between treatment groups, with the exception of the 50-minute time point, at which combination treatment was significantly more effective than ketotifen alone (P </= 0.05). The proportion of subjects who requested relief drops after CAC was significantly lower in both the ketotifen alone and combination treatment groups compared with the desloratadine alone group (P = 0.004).; Ketotifen ophthalmic solution significantly decreased the signs and symptoms of ocular and nasal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

We set out to compare their antihistaminic activity in the skin for 24 h in a double-blind, randomized cross-over trial.; The skin reaction to histamine administered by prick tests (100 mg ml(-1)) was measured by the surface areas of weals and flares for 24 h [before treatment, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 h after a single dose of levocetirizine (5 mg), desloratadine (5 mg) or placebo] in 18 healthy volunteers (34.8 +/- 9.4 years; 14 women). The areas under the curves (AUC) of the weal and flare areas as a function of time were compared by ANOVA.; A highly significant overall treatment effect (P < 0.0001) was observed and both weals and flares were inhibited. The pairwise comparisons showed that the activity of levocetirizine and desloratadine was significantly superior to that of placebo (P < 0.0001), and the activity of levocetirizine was significantly superior to that of desloratadine (P < 0.0001). 'Total' weal inhibition (> or = 95%) occurred only with levocetirizine. Median values of maximal weal inhibition were 44.2% with placebo, 55.0% with desloratadine and 100% with levocetirizine. The time to maximal weal inhibition was 4 h (median value) for all three study drugs, but scattered over a wider range for desloratadine (3-24 h) than levocetirizine (2-4 h). With desloratadine, five of 18 (28%) subjects reached weal inhibition of at least 70% at between 3 and 10 h, whereas with levocetirizine all subjects [18/18 (100%)] reached this level of weal inhibition at between 1 and 3 h. The median duration of 70% weal inhibition was zero with placebo and desloratadine, and was 21.4 h with levocetirizine (P < 0.0001 between the three study drugs, and P < 0.0001 between the two active drugs). No uncommon adverse events were reported, and no subject withdrew from the study due to an adverse event.; This study shows that the activity of levocetirizine in suppressing skin reactivity to histamine was clearly superior to that of desloratadine for 24 h after a single dose.

This double blind, crossover study examined the effects of desloratadine in 12 healthy volunteers. Levocetirizine was used as a comparator.; Desloratadine (5 mg), levocetirizine (5 mg) or placebo was taken orally 4 h before an intradermal injection of histamine (20 microL, 100 microM) or vehicle control into the forearm skin.

To date, loratadine has been evaluated in allergic rhinitis, urticaria and, to a limited extent, in asthma. In several large controlled comparative clinical studies, loratadine was superior to placebo, faster acting than astemizole and as effective as azatadine, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine (chlorphenamine), clemastine, hydroxyzine, mequitazine and terfenadine in patients with allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria. The clinical effectiveness of loratadine in asthma is at present unclear. Loratadine is well tolerated. At dosages of 10 mg daily, commonly reported adverse events were somnolence, fatigue and headache. Sedation occurred less frequently with loratadine than with azatadine, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine and mequitazine. Serious ventricular arrhythmias, as reported with some other second generation histamine H1-receptor antagonists, have not been observed with loratadine to date.

Recognition, causes and treatment.","Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic; Histamine H1 Antagonists; Humans; Urticaria","Ormerod, A D","The urticarias are a complex group of disorders characterised by transient whealing or swelling of the skin. Understanding the many possible causes is the first step in assessing urticaria. Allergic and drug-induced urticaria respond to removal of the cause. The physical urticarias, particularly delayed pressure urticaria and also urticarial vasculitis, require separate consideration. For the majority of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, nonsedating antihistamines are the mainstay of treatment. There are several to choose from, including cetirizine, astemizole, loratadine, terfenadine and acrivastine, each with its own pharmacokinetics and antiallergic properties. When these fail, histamine H2-antagonists may help either alone or in combination with H1-antagonists. Older sedative antihistamines are still useful. Ketotifen, oxatomide and azelastine have mast cell stabilising effects that are considered an advantage in treating these disorders. Second-line therapies include a wide range of drugs such as doxepin, dapsone, attenuated androgens, calcium antagonists, antimalarials, gold and methotrexate. The most effective and regularly used second-line agents are corticosteroids. These are best limited to short term crisis management, except in severe recalcitrant cases, and in patients with pressure urticaria or urticarial vasculitis. Recent work on circulating histamine releasing autoantibodies suggests that there is scope for more aggressive immunosuppression in selected patients. However, effective treatment with immunosuppression often requires plasma exchange and more toxic agents such as cyclosporin. Such treatments are only likely to be entertained in exceptional cases.",I,E

Outside the pollen season in 12 patients from the above group a histamine release from isolated basophils was evaluated by Shore method, using a-IgE and pollen allergen as liberators, before and after 4 days therapy with loratadine. In the group of the 11 asthmatic patients the effect of the single dose of 10 mg Loratadine on spirometric parameters and on a bronchial response to histamine was studied. The Bronchial Provocation Test with histamine was performed by the Ryan's method. The results were expressed as PC20 FEV1. It was shown that loratadine statistically significant limited of the skin reactivity to histamine and specific histamine release from basophils. The one tablet of Loratadine have not changed of spirometric parameters in the patients with mild asthma, but statistically significant reduced their bronchial response to histamine.",E,E

According to a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized design, 28 patients were treated with one of the two drugs once daily in the morning for 2 weeks during the 1990 grass pollen season. The severity of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasopharyngeal itching and itchy, watery, red eyes was evaluated by the investigator after a 1-week run-in period and at the end of the treatment. The patients made a daily record of the severity of symptoms on a diary card. In addition, drug-related central nervous system (CNS) effects were assessed at baseline and at the end of the treatment by neuropsychological tests aimed at investigating selective and sustained attention, visuomotor abilities and anxiety, and by quantitative, bit-mapped EEG. Both terfenadine and cetirizine produced a significant improvement in symptoms at endpoint without any significant difference between the two drugs. Drowsiness was referred by one patient in each treatment group. No significant impairment of psychomotor performance occurred with either drug. Quantitative EEG showed a significant power increase in the relative (%) delta band in both groups of treated patients. Although the difference was not statistically significant, a tendency towards greater involvement of the CNS was observed with the use of cetirizine. In conclusion, the results of this study confirm that terfenadine and cetirizine are equally effective in the management of hay fever. Some differentiated untoward EEG changes were also observed in relation to the drugs used, without any variation in neuropsychological performance.",I,E

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of betahistine (an H3-receptor blocker with partial H1- and H2-agonism) on the dynamics of the cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction. The skin blister technique was used to collect inflammatory cells after intradermal (i.d.) administration of grass pollen antigen, histamine and betahistine to 11 atopic volunteers. In this open, cross-over study, volunteers were randomly allocated to five treatment protocols i.e. (a) histamine 1 microgram i.d.; (b) betahistine 57, 114 and 285 micrograms i.d.; (c) i.d. grass pollen antigen; (d) (c) plus oral betahistine; (e) (c) plus oral betahistine, cetirizine, (H1-blocker) and cimetidine (H2-blocker).

Combined oral therapy with cetirizine, cimetidine and betahistine reduced the area of grass pollen-induced induration significantly at all time periods, but caused a significant increase in eosinophil and neutrophil vacuolisation during the late phase reaction. This did not occur with orally administered betahistine alone. Intradermal betahistine induced significantly more neutrophil and eosinophil vacuolization than histamine and, in contrast to the latter, also mediated a concentration-dependent late phase induration. The results of this study suggest that the H3-receptor regulates a feedback system in conjunction with that previously proven for the H2-receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

The three H1 receptor antagonists significantly inhibited antigen/mitogen-induced PBMC proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Allergen-specific T-cell responses in allergic individuals were similarly inhibited. The effect of the three drugs was also tested in cultures of mononuclear cells derived from adenoid tissue. The growth kinetics were investigated using spontaneously proliferating cell lines to examine whether the inhibition was caused by general toxicity. Three cell lines, HCT 8 (an ileocaecal adenocarcinoma) RPMI 8866 (B-cell line) and 166 A2 (T hybridoma) were tested. Loratadine (< 0.03 microM) and dexchlorpheniramine (< 0.62 microM) altered the kinetics of HCT 8 and RPMI 8866, respectively. When testing RPMI 8866 and 166 A2, the growth-inhibitory effect of terfenadine and loratadine could be neutralized by addition of cell culture filtrate from RPMI 8866 or 166 A2. These culture filtrates are rich in soluble low-affinity IgE receptor (sCD23) and IgE-binding factor (IgEBF), respectively. Our findings show that the antihistamines investigated display some non-convential in vitro anti-allergic properties possibly not related to their interaction with the H1 receptor. In addition, our results suggest: a) The H1 receptor antagonists used differ in their pattern of cell inhibition; b) The inhibitory effect is completely reversible at low drug concentrations.",E,E

Their usefulness, however, is sometimes compromised by undesirable central nervous system (CNS) side effects such as daytime sedation and anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth. Second-generation, nonsedating antihistamines (terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, and cetirizine hydrochloride) are just as effective as the potent first-generation antihistamines such as hydroxyzine. Yet they do not cause the CNS and anticholinergic side effects seen with the older agents. Cardiovascular side effects, which have been recently reported with terfenadine and astemizole, are dose related and rare, generally occurring in patients who overdose or who take concomitant medications that increase serum antihistamine levels. The second-generation antihistamines also offer twice daily and once daily dosage schedules, which are more convenient than the two- to four-times daily schedules of the older agents. They should therefore be considered first-line agents for the treatment of chronic urticaria. This article is a review of the role of the nonsedating antihistamines in the treatment of chronic urticaria.",E,E

Few dose-response studies of H1-antagonists in allergic rhinitis or chronic urticaria have been published. The manufacturers' recommend doses for H1-antagonists appear to be optimal with regard to safety and should not be exceeded, as the incidence of adverse effects may increase when higher doses are used. Also, even if higher doses are given, complete symptom relief may not occur in all patients, as total H1-blockade still leaves the effects of other chemical mediators of inflammation unopposed.",E,E

Rarely, some of the newer H1-antagonists may cause cardiac dysrhythmias after overdose or under other specific conditions. The concept of a risk-free H1-antagonist is proving to be an oversimplification. An H1-antagonist absolutely free from adverse effects under all circumstances is not yet available for use. The magnitude of the beneficial effects of each H1-antagonist should be related to the magnitude of the unwanted effects, especially in the CNS and cardiovascular system, and a benefit-risk ratio or therapeutic index should be developed for each medication in this class.",E,E

Thus, in dermographic urticaria, adding an H2 antagonist to treatment with a potent H1 antagonist gives a small, significant reduction in wealing response, but no symptomatic benefit.

Two hundred thirty-six children ages 6-12 years, with chronic allergic skin disorders were treated for 14 days. The predominant skin condition was atrophic dermatitis (88% of the efficacy population). Evaluation of efficacy was based on investigator and patient assessment of symptoms, overall condition of the disease, and therapeutic response to treatment. After 7 and 14 days of treatment, and in the endpoint analysis (last valid study visit for all patients) the decreases from baseline in mean total sign/symptom scores, and all individual symptoms, did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between treatments.

Data available at the time of the previous review in Drugs, together with more recent results, have clearly demonstrated that levocabastine nasal spray and eyedrops are clinically effective, have a rapid onset of action and are well tolerated in patients with nasal and/or ocular allergic conditions. Previous evidence indicating that topical levocabastine has efficacy similar to or better than that of topical sodium cromoglycate (cromolyn sodium) has been confirmed in more recent studies. Furthermore, results from a number of controlled clinical trials have also shown that topical levocabastine is at least as effective as oral terfenadine for the treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Notably, topical levocabastine appears to be more effective than oral terfenadine in improving the severity of selected symptoms. Limited data indicating efficacy equivalent to that of oral loratadine, oral cetirizine or azelastine nasal spray will need to be confirmed. Data from several studies have shown that topical levocabastine has a tolerability profile similar to that of placebo, topical sodium cromoglycate or oral terfenadine. The main adverse events seen in patients treated with topical levocabastine are ocular irritation after application of eyedrops, and headache, nasal irritation, somnolence and fatigue after administration of the nasal spray. Administered doses of topical levocabastine, and subsequent plasma concentrations, are low, and the risk of systemic adverse events is therefore expected to be minimal. Thus, topical administration of levocabastine rapid and effective symptom relief with no apparent serious adverse events in patients with allergic rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis. Topical levocabastine is a useful alternative to topical sodium cromoglycate or oral terfenadine. Additional data supporting current evidence that topical levocabastine can provide more effective symptom relief than oral terfenadine, together with clarification of the relative efficacies of these agents in relation to varying pollen exposure, would help to further confirm its clinical potential. However, the results available to date suggest that the topical formulations of levocabastine are a valuable treatment option in patients with allergic rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis.",E,E

Compared to placebo, cetirizine significantly (P < 0.05) decreased daily symptom scores of nasal discharge, nasal itching, and sneezing, as well as the number of sneezings after nasal challenge with the antigen, without alleviating nasal obstruction (P > 0.05). It also suppressed both early (P < 0.05) and late skin reactions to intradermal tests. Although cetirizine did not influence in vitro sulfidoleukotriene production by blood leukocytes with buffer or anti-IgE (P > 0.05), it substantially reduced the release of these mediators upon challenge with Dp antigen. Furthermore, there was a high correlation between the number of sneezes after challenge and the amount of sulfidoleukotriene released in nine patients (r = 0.78; P < 0.01). It is concluded that the amount of sulfidoleukotrienes produced by blood leukocytes in vitro may reflect the nasal hyperreactivity of the patient, and that cetirizine, which is highly effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, owes part of its effect to inhibition of sulfidoleukotriene releasability by blood leukocytes in children.",E,E

Glass micropipettes with a tip diameter of 7-9 microns are inserted by a micromanipulator into the stratum papillare containing the capillary loops and used for microinjection by microsyringe and special dispenser. Transcapillary diffusion of sodium fluorescein applied by intravenous bolus injection is visualised by fluorescence videomicroscopy and stored on videotape. Perivascular fluorescent light intensity (FLI) is measured in arbitrary units (AU) by videodensitometry around the site of microinjection during playback of the videotapes. The method was tested by microinjection of 0.5 microliter histamine (1% solution) at the distal tibial plateau. Mean FLI values representing microvascular permeability were 2186 AU 10 min after microinjection of histamine, 420 AU after physiologic saline and 1228 AU after histamine combined with oral intake of 20 mg cetirizine. Cetirizine significantly reduced (P < 0.01) the increased permeability induced by histamine. However, the mean values after injection of the H1-blocker were still significantly enhanced (P < 0.01) when compared to the mean values observed after injection of physiologic saline solution, which provoked only minor microtrauma. The technique offers new scope for pharmacological testing in man.",E,E

We have therefore prospectively studied all patients with acute urticaria attending the department of dermatology (n = 72) and a rural dermatology office (n = 37) during the course of 1 year. After a standardized history and physical examination, patients were randomized into treatment with either loratadine (10 mg/day for 3 days) or prednisolene (50 mg/day for 3 days). All patients were followed up until complete remission. Most patients suffered from moderate (42%) to severe (40%) disease. Possible eliciting factors were identified in less than 50% of the cases. Associated upper respiratory tract infections were found most commonly (39.5%), followed by possibly eliciting drugs, mostly analgesics (9.2%) and suspected food intolerance (0.9%). The course of the disease was self-limited in all cases, the longest episode lasting for 3 weeks. Both treatment regimens were effective in controlling whealing, but in corticosteroid-treated patients, symptoms ceased earlier, with complete remission occurring within 3 days of treatment in 93.8%, compared to 65.9% of patients treated with loratadine (p < 0.001). Acute urticaria is thus frequently idiopathic and only rarely associated with IgE-mediated events. It is, however, largely self-limited, with prompt response to symptomatic treatment.",E,E

Patients allergic to at least one tree and/or grass aeroallergen received one of the following regimens for up to 4 weeks; mometasone furoate 100 micrograms once daily [OD] (n = 126) or 200 micrograms OD (n = 126), BDP 200 micrograms twice daily (n = 126), or only placebo spray (n = 123). Physician-rated nasal and total symptom scores, and global evaluation of overall condition and therapeutic response by physicians and patients, showed that the three active treatments were equally effective, and all three were significantly superior to placebo at most time points. Overall, mometasone furoate 200 micrograms OD demonstrated somewhat greater numerical, but not statistical, superiority to mometasone furoate 100 micrograms OD at the earliest evaluation time point. At the end of treatment, complete or marked relief was obtained in 77% of patients with mometasone furoate 100 micrograms/day, 79% with mometasone furoate 200 micrograms/day, and 74% with BDP, compared with 54% of placebo vehicle control patients.

Nasal obstruction, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal and ocular pruritus were scored each day throughout the study by patients using a symptom scale ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 3 (severe). The mean proportion of days without symptoms was higher in the COM group (11.8%) than in the CTZ (6.8%) and PER (5.1%) groups, but the differences were not statistically significant. The mean percentage of days when symptoms were absent or at most mild was significantly higher in the COM group (64.8%) than in either CTZ (45.5%; p = 0.003) or PER groups (40.6%; p = 0.0001). In addition, evaluation of symptoms by investigators and their global evaluation at the end of treatment showed statistically significant differences in favour of COM compared, to both CTZ and PER. The most frequent adverse events were somnolence in the CTZ and COM groups (8.6% and 12.9%, respectively) while insomnia was most frequent in the PER group. No clinically significant abnormalities were found in haematological or biochemical tests.

A second period, of therapy, of 30 days, during which the subjects took a 10 mg tablet of ZYRTEC as a daily dose. Efficacy was evaluated at each visit by scores of intensity of major symptoms (sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, nasal pruritus) and secondary symptoms (ocular score ... ) of rhinitis, as well as anterior rhinoscopy. The patients made an auto-evaluation of symptoms at different times. Analysis of the different parameters showed a real efficacy of ZYRTEC, for 30 days of treatment, in young patients. Furthermore, the tolerance of the product is excellent. This study has shown an overall improvement in the symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis in patients who were treated with ZYRTEC in conditions similar to those of usual medical practice by pediatricians and allergologists.",E,E

Bradykinin also reduced the minimal nasal cross-sectional area (Amin), increased albumin release into nasal lavage fluid and increased the symptoms of nasal inflammation. Pretreatment with cetirizine (10 mg orally) reduced the fall in Amin induced by bradykinin, 300 micrograms, but not by bradykinin, 100 micrograms. Pre-treatment of the subjects with the H1 histamine receptor antgonist cetirizine (10 mg, orally) or terfenadine (60 mg, orally) 3 h before bradykinin administration caused significant reduction of the bradykinin-induced increase in nasal airway resistance in the upper range of bradykinin doses (300-1000 micrograms) but not in the lower range (10-100 micrograms). Cetirizine reduced the albumin release into the nasal airway and the symptoms induced by bradykinin, 1000 micrograms. Following nasal challenge with bradykinin 300 micrograms or 1000 micrograms, no increase could be detected in the histamine content of nasal lavage fluid. Isolated human nasal cells released histamine in response to bradykinin, 33 and 100 microM, anti-IgE and calcium ionophore, A23187. We conclude that the actions of bradykinin in the human nasal airway are, in part, accounted for by the release of histamine.",E,E

The three agents effectively reduce symptoms without the sometimes intolerable adverse effects of older drugs, but they are not completely equivalent. For example, terfenadine requires twice/day dosing, whereas the others can be given once/day. Astemizole has a slow onset and extremely prolonged duration of action. Both terfenadine and astemizole may have cardiotoxic effects (e.g., torsades de pointes) when serum concentrations rise due to overdosing or drug interactions.

This view must be accepted, yet can hardly be assessed under treatment of allergic disorders. Since central sedative potency is hard to evaluate, different methods of measurement have been introduced in the four phases of clinical investigation. While tests of high complexity in early trials can detect true central effects, they seem to have the disadvantage of not taking into consideration the important interactions of drugs with the disorder. Therefore, we used a visual analog scale (VAS) as an instrument to demonstrate sedative effects in five clinical studies carried out between 1989 and 1994 with a total number of 1070 patients. Thereby, we could assess the result of the different components of the central interaction. In 1989, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we could show that the vigilance of patients suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis increased significantly more under treatment with an antihistamine (mizolastine) than under placebo. From 1992 until 1994, we compared azelastine nasal spray either by the double-dummy technique with oral antihistamines (cetirizine, loratadine, and astemizole) or by the double-dummy or placebo-controlled design with monotherapy or combined therapy with azelastine tablets. A marked or statistically significant improvement of vigilance was found for all compounds (loratadine: P < 0.0001; cetirizine: P < 0.0254; and azelastine nasal spray: P < 0.1409 to P < 0.0001). Even when taking azelastine as oral application, patients, in spite of the warning, reported a similar increase in vigilance (P < 0.2628 to P < 0.0001). Finally, we assessed the range of physiologic vigilance using the same VAS in healthy volunteers. In conclusion, we could prove that in all trials the baseline values of vigilance of untreated symptomatic patients were far below physiologic condition and improved under treatment to the upper range of healthy persons. Therefore, any sedative properties of modern H1-antihistamines should not limit their therapeutic use, since the truly threatening sedation results from the disorder itself.",I,E

There is evidence that loratadine is practically void of these sedative effects, and therefore might be prescribed to pilots. A study was conducted to determine the effects of loratadine on performance and alertness. In a randomized, double-blind, within subjects design, 18 male subjects were studied, employing loratadine 10 mg, triprolidine hydrochloride 5 mg, and placebo. Objective (vigilance, complex tasks) and subjective tests, tailored to the specific tasks of aircrew, were applied under hypobaric conditions that prevail in an intact cockpit. With respect to alertness and performance, the results of this study showed no significant differences between loratadine and placebo during a period of 1 to 6 hours after drug ingestion. Triprolidine, used as a positive control, showed significant detrimental effects on both subjective and objective measures. It is anticipated that a single dose of loratadine 10 mg will not affect flying performance. This finding might also have implications for the treatment of allergic disorders of personnel involved in other highly skilled jobs.",I,E

Thus this large amount is useless in terms of drug efficacy whereas it may generate side of toxic effects in other tissues. An attempt to optimize drug distribution is to limit or even to suppress its useless localisations. This is possible with H1 antagonists as these drugs develop benefic effects in organs which are distinct from those where toxic effects may occur. Cetirizine is an example of choice of this strategy. It is poorly distributed into tissues, especially in heart and liver which favors preferential binding at its target H1 selected receptors.",E,E

We assessed the nasal effect of these two antihistamines in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial in order to compare objectively their efficacy and onset of action in the noses of patients with allergic rhinitis. Nasal challenge was performed by nebulization of increasing doubling doses of histamine (0, 0.04-1.28 mg/nostril) in 12 patients (eight men, four women, aged 22-39 years). Nasal airway resistance (NAR) was measured by posterior rhinomanometry either 1.5 h or 4 h after intake of cetirizine (10 mg), loratadine (10 mg), or placebo. Baseline NAR was identical between all study days (2.60-2.88 cmH2O.l-1.s). One and a half hours after intake, the increase in NAR induced by histamine was significantly reduced by both cetirizine and loratadine in contrast to placebo. However, with cetirizine the nasal obstruction was significantly lower than with loratadine (P < 0.05). Four hours after intake, a similar inhibition of the nasal obstruction caused by histamine was observed with both cetirizine and loratadine (P < 0.05). In conclusion, this study found cetirizine and loratadine to have similar nasal efficacy at therapeutic dosage 4 h after intake, whereas cetirizine was more effective than loratadine 1.5 h after intake. In agreement with the results observed in the skin, our study suggests a more rapid onset of action of cetirizine in the nose in allergic rhinitis.",I,1

A 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigated the safety and efficacy of cetirizine syrup (5 or 10 mg daily) in 209 children ages 6 to 11 years with SAR. Parents assisted patients in recording symptom severity (sneezing, nasal discharge, itchy eyes, itchy nose or mouth, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion) daily. A total symptom severity (TSS) score was derived from all symptoms, excluding nasal congestion. At baseline, TSS was comparable for all groups (range 6.8-7.0). Cetirizine 10 mg produced a significantly greater mean TSS reduction (3.2) than placebo (P < 0.05) over the treatment period. Cetirizine 5 mg once daily produced mean reductions in weekly symptom scores of 2.4; this did not differ statistically from placebo. Furthermore, cetirizine 10 mg significantly improved symptoms of itchy eyes, nose, or mouth. The most commonly reported adverse reactions to both cetirizine and placebo were headache, pharyngitis, and abdominal pain, which did not occur with an incidence statistically different from that of placebo. Once-daily cetirizine is safe for treating SAR in children ages 6-11 years. Once-daily cetirizine 10 mg provides effective improvement in symptoms and is well tolerated.",E,E

A review of its efficacy in the treatment of respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent patients.,Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Child; Clarithromycin; Drug Interactions; Humans; Immunocompetence; Respiratory Tract Infections,"Langtry, H D; Brogden, R N","Clarithromycin is a broad spectrum macrolide antibacterial agent active in vitro and effective in vivo against the major pathogens responsible for respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent patients. It is highly active in vitro against pathogens causing atypical pneumonia (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella spp.) and has similar activity to other macrolides against Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Haemophilus influenzae is susceptible or intermediately susceptible to clarithromycin alone, but activity is enhanced when the parent drug and metabolite are combined in vitro. Absorption of clarithromycin is unaffected by food. More than half of an oral dose is systemically available as the parent drug and the active 14-hydroxy metabolite. Pharmacokinetics are nonlinear, with plasma concentrations increasing in more than proportion to the dosage. First-pass metabolism results in the rapid appearance of the active metabolite 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin in plasma. Clarithromycin and its active metabolite are found in greater concentrations in the tissues and fluids of the respiratory tract than in plasma. Dosage adjustments are required for patients with severe renal failure, but not for elderly patients or those with hepatic impairment. Drug interactions related to the cytochrome P450 system may occur with clarithromycin use. In addition to the standard immediate-release formulation for administration twice daily, a modified-release formulation of clarithromycin is now available for use once daily. In dosages of 500 to 1000 mg/day for 5 to 14 days, clarithromycin was as effective in the treatment of community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections in hospital and community settings as beta-lactam agents (with or without a beta-lactamase inhibitor), cephalosporins and most other macrolides. Clarithromycin was similar in efficacy to azithromycin in comparative studies and is as effective as and better tolerated than erythromycin. Adverse events are primarily gastrointestinal in nature, but result in fewer withdrawals from therapy than are seen with erythromycin. Clarithromycin provides similar clinical and bacteriological efficacy to that seen with beta-lactam agents, cephalosporins and other macrolides. It offers a cost-saving alternative to intravenous erythromycin use in US hospitals and is available in both once-daily and twice-daily formulations. The spectrum of activity of clarithromycin against common and emerging respiratory tract pathogens may make it suitable for use in the community as empirical therapy of respiratory tract infections in both children and adults.",E,E

This double-blind study involved 342 patients, randomly allocated to once-daily 10 mg mizolastine (n = 115), once-daily 120 mg terfenadine (n = 116), or placebo (n = 111) groups. All patients started treatment on 1 May, before the onset of the grass pollen season. The prophylactic effect of test drugs was assessed on their ability to delay the time to the first hay fever crisis of the season, which was defined by the occurrence of one of the following events: use of rescue medication, study withdrawal because of treatment failure, or total diary symptom score over 18. Active treatments prolonged the time to the first crisis by approximately 1 week (mizolastine 55 days, terfenadine 57 days) in comparison with placebo (50 days) (survival curve analysis: Logrank test, P = 0.01; Wilcoxon test, P = 0.03).

Patients recorded their nasal symptoms (nighttime and daytime obstruction, sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and overall discomfort) using a 4-point scale (0 = no symptoms, 3 = very frequent symptoms) in daily diaries. Clinicians assessed patients' nasal symptoms (nighttime and daytime obstruction, sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea) using a 4-point scale at every scheduled visit. Clinicians and patients assessed the overall effectiveness of treatment at the end of the study. Fluticasone propionate improved clinician-rated total nasal symptom scores (defined as the sum of five nasal symptoms) more than loratadine at the 2-week and 4-week assessments (P < or = 0.008). Clinicians give fluticasone propionate better global ratings than loratadine (P = 0.04). After 4 weeks of treatment, between-group differences in clinician-rated individual nasal symptoms favored fluticasone propionate (P < 0.05), with the exception of nasal itching (P = 0.11). These findings were confirmed by between-group differences in the percentages of symptom-free days calculated from patient-recorded daily diary-card data. Both treatments were well tolerated.

Odds ratio was calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Twenty-four controlled studies met the inclusion criteria with more than 200,000 participating women. The summary odds ratio of major malformations associated with antihistamines taken during the first trimester was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.60-0.94). This analysis indicates that H1 blockers used mainly for morning sickness during the first trimester do not increase the teratogenic risk in humans and may, in fact, be associated with a protective effect. More study is needed to verify the possibility that by preventing vomiting, antihistamines may ensure better metabolic conditions to the fetus and thus may reduce some birth defects.

Subjects received a single dose (day 1) and multiple doses (days 3 to 10) of a once-daily (QD) formulation of loratadine 10 mg in an immediate-release coating and pseudoephedrine sulfate 240 mg in an extended-release core (CLAR-ITIN-D 24 HOUR tablets), and a twice-daily (BID) formulation of loratadine 5 mg in an immediate-release coating and pseudoephedrine sulfate 120 mg, with 60 mg in an immediate-release coating and 60 mg in the barrier-protected core (CLARITIN-D 12 HOUR tablets) in study sessions, each separated by a 10-day washout period.

Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing lung function changes under repeated use of antihistamine in adult asthma were selected, and the quality of studies was scored. Morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was the primary outcome: an effect size was computed for each study, with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI), and a mean effect size was computed, combining all studies. Effect sizes were also determined for secondary outcomes: evening PEFR, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and daily use of inhaled beta-agonists. Nineteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Mean quality score of studies was 59.4%; asthma was generally uncontrolled at study inclusion. Altogether, 582 antihistamine-treated and 557 placebo-treated asthma patients were evaluable.

In light of recent reports that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants may be weak CYP3A4 inhibitors, this study was designed to investigate the effects of paroxetine on the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of terfenadine. Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in a randomized open-label, two-period, steady-state crossover study. Terfenadine (60 mg twice daily for 8 days) was administered alone and with paroxetine at steady state (20 mg once daily for 15 days, with terfenadine on days 8 through 15). Extensive electrocardiogram monitoring was conducted throughout, and terfenadine and carboxyterfenadine pharmacokinetics were assessed at the end of each treatment period. One subject withdrew because of adverse experiences related to paroxetine, but the other 11 subjects completed the study uneventfully. On the final day of coadministration, the rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) was unaltered compared with terfenadine dosed alone; maximum QTc values (mean [SEM]) were 404 (4) and 405 (5) msec, respectively. Terfenadine pharmacokinetics were also unchanged; geometric mean steady-state area under the curve (AUC)tau values were 30.0 ng.hr/mL during coadministration compared with 30.8 ng.hr/mL when dosed alone (p > 0.05). The corresponding Cmax values were 3.68 and 3.64 ng/mL (p > 0.05). There was, however, a small (on average 17-20%), unexplained reduction in the steadystate Cmax and AUCtau of carboxyterfenadine during coadministration with paroxetine. In conclusion, paroxetine does not affect the pharmacokinetics or cardiovascular effects of terfenadine. The small reduction in carboxyterfenadine plasma concentrations is unlikely to be important clinically.",E,E

To gain insight into the possible contribution of opiate receptors to itching we compared the antipruritic effect of naltrexone (Nemexin), an opiate antagonist, to an H1-receptor antagonist and to placebo. In a double blind cross-over study on 15 healthy volunteers, 25 mg naltrexone or placebo was orally given 60 min prior to a histamine stimulus. In a second, otherwise identical experiment, 10 mg cetirizine, an H1 blocker, or placebo was orally given 12 h before the experiment to the same group of volunteers. Histamine was applied iontophoretically to the forearm skin and the following parameters were assessed thereafter: weal and flare size, itch intensity and the extension of the area of alloknesis ('itchy skin') around the application site. Naltrexone had no effect on the vascular histamine reactions 'weal' and 'flare', whereas cetirizine abolished the weal reactions and greatly diminished the flare reactions. Both naltrexone and cetirizine significantly diminished histamine induced itching. In contrast to placebo and cetirizine, naltrexone abolished alloknesis completely in four of 15 volunteers and in the others alloknesis was greatly reduced after naltrexone. Since vascular reactions to histamine are of peripheral origin, whereas alloknesis depends on central nervous mechanisms, our findings suggest a pronounced centrally mediated action of naltrexone on histamine induced pruritus.",E,E

To show the clinical impact of this challenge model, the effect of a histamine H1-receptor antagonist that also has some antiallergic properties (loratadine) was also investigated. The study followed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Medication was given orally over 7 days before the provocation at a dose of 10 mg once daily. All 12 patients, whose dust-mite sensitivity was confirmed by disease history, skin prick test, and RAST, completed the challenge session. The documentation of the chosen parameters was performed every 30 min. Subjective nasal and ocular symptoms were assessed via a visual analog scale of 100 mm, nasal flow was recorded by active anterior rhinomanometry, and mediator release was evaluated with nasal lavages. Clinical aspect: the whole sample population showed a rise of nasal and ocular symptom severity and a nasal flow reduction, which were perceptibly, but not significantly attenuated by active drug treatment. Mediator pattern: in each patient, prostaglandin (PG)D2 and leukotriene (LT)C4 levels peaked within the first 2 h of provocation, PGD2 then moving toward baseline levels, and LTC4 then again rising continuously. Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) exhibited a constant level increase over the whole provocation period, and tryptase levels did not change significantly. Whereas the area under the curve values of tryptase and ECP were higher in drug-treated patients than the placebo group, the early PGD2 peak occurring during the first two challenge hours seemed to be mitigated by loratadine. These results reveal that there is no link between the clinical symptoms, the drug efficacy, and the released mediators (LTC4, PGD2, ECP, and tryptase).",E,E

Studies and abstracts chosen summarize the clinical action of troglitazone in healthy volunteers, in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, and in patients with diabetes mellitus. Three of the six published human studies used subjects in a placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized environment (type 2 diabetic patients or obese subjects with insulin resistance).; All clinical trials available, including unpublished reports, were reviewed.; Troglitazone is the first member of a new class of medications, the thiazolidinediones, to be approved for clinical use. Troglitazone increases insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and in hepatic and adipose tissue. It has been shown to decrease hepatic glucose output while having no effect on stimulating insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta-cells. Its metabolic effects decrease fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia, insulin concentrations, and triglyceride concentrations, while increasing high-density lipoprotein concentrations. There is some evidence, based on short-term trials, that troglitazone causes only minimal decreases in glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) concentrations. Data suggest that troglitazone decreases impaired glucose tolerance in nondiabetic obese subjects and leads to a reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Troglitazone has a mild adverse effect profile, with rare instances of abnormal liver function tests.; Troglitazone appears to be a safe, effective, and useful new agent in the treatment of insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, although its HbA1C-lowering effects have been minimal in short-term trials, and its insulin dosage-reduction activity remains unclear. The Food and Drug Administration has also approved its use as monotherapy and in combination with sulfonylureas for patients with type 2 diabetes.

The disease is multifactorial, and although genetic predisposition is certainly a prerequisite, a number of environmental factors modulate the phenotypic expression of AD. The majority of affected children shows IgE sensitisation towards a large variety of foods and aeroallergens. Since at least 1600, it has been recognized that patients with AD have a high predisposition to develop asthma. Recent epidemiological studies show that AD is commonly seen in individuals from families with a history of asthma. In addition, in population where asthma is uncommon, AD is also uncommon. The sex distribution of AD and asthma is the same, with boys affected significantly more often by these two atopic diseases and in similar proportions. The ETAC project (Early Treatment of the Atopic Child) is a large multicenter, multi-national, double blind, placebo controlled, randomised trial. The main objective of the study is to stop the progression from AD to asthma in young children with AD using early therapeutic intervention with Cetirizine and the second objective is to investigate the main risk factors for the onset of asthma. The results of this study indicate that exposure to potent allergens such as cat or mite significantly increased the risk of sensitisation to these allergens. Prolonged breast feeding was associated with a lowest sensitisation rate to cow milk proteins and to egg. Therefore environmental factors seem to play a crucial role in IgE sensitisation in children with AD.",E,E

At all post-baseline evaluations (days 3, 7, and averaged over the two days), brompheniramine was significantly better than loratadine and placebo for both sets of summed symptom scores and all three global assessments. Loratadine was significantly better than placebo for physician ratings of total symptom severity averaged over the two days and for the physician and subject ratings of the nasal cluster on day 3. Central nervous system-related symptoms were the most frequently reported adverse experiences; somnolence was reported most frequently by patients taking brompheniramine, and its occurrence was less frequent as treatment continued.

In the cross-over analysis the results of image analysis were influenced by the period, but this effect disappeared after adjustment of the ambient temperature during the 3 days of the test. These results demonstrate that cetirizine has an impact on the inflammatory process in a clinical model of cell-mediated allergic reaction, although this effect is only detected with a very sensitive technique.

The aim of this study was to assess the determinants of interindividual variability and extent of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 inhibition during paroxetine and fluvoxamine treatment. Healthy volunteers and patients received caffeine (100 mg) and dextromethorphan (30 mg) at baseline and at steady state of paroxetine (10-20 mg/day, 5-74 days, N = 13) or fluvoxamine (50-100 mg/day, 5-43 days, N = 8). The caffeine metabolic ratio (CMR) and the log O-demethylation ratio (ODMR) of dextromethorphan in overnight urine were used as in vivo indices of the CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 isozyme activities, respectively. All subjects had an extensive metabolizer phenotype for CYP2D6. After fluvoxamine treatment, baseline CMR 5.1 +/- 1.4 (mean +/- SD) decreased to 2.7 +/- 1.1 (p < 0.01). Paroxetine did not have a significant effect on CMR (p > 0.05). In seven of eight subjects in the fluvoxamine group, posttreatment CMR was comparable with the minimum CMR value (2.0) attainable in nonsmoking healthy volunteers. After paroxetine treatment, log ODMR changed from a baseline value of -2.28 +/- 0.37 to -1.13 +/- 0.44, indicating significant inhibition of CYP2D6 (p < 0.001). Subjects' CYP2D6 phenotype did not change after paroxetine treatment. Fluvoxamine had no significant effect on log ODMR (p > 0.05). The extent of inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 by paroxetine and fluvoxamine, respectively, displayed a positive correlation with baseline enzyme activity (p < 0.05). In addition, a negative association was found between the plasma paroxetine concentration and the CYP2D6 activity after paroxetine treatment (r = -0.47, p < 0.05). These data indicate that paroxetine and fluvoxamine treatment with minimum clinically effective doses significantly inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, respectively. The extent of inhibition of CYP2D6 by paroxetine and of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine is dependent in part on the baseline enzyme activity. The interindividual variability in CYP2D6 inhibition by paroxetine can also be explained by variability in plasma paroxetine concentration. Most patients treated with fluvoxamine (50-100 mg/day) will reach population minimums for CYP1A2 activity. These results have potential implications for interindividual variability in the risk for drug-drug interactions mediated by CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 as well as for the disposition of 17beta-estradiol and environmental procarcinogens.",E,E

Rather than stimulating insulin secretion, it enhances insulin sensitivity. Potential advantages of troglitazone over oral sulfonylureas include decreased endogenous insulin concentrations, decreased exogenous insulin requirements, reduced hypoglycemic risk, and convenient once/day administration. The effect on morbidity and mortality from lowering endogenous and exogenous insulin concentrations remains to be determined. Troglitazone also has potential disadvantages. It induces cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4, although few drug interactions have been identified to date. Serum transaminases must be monitored routinely because of rarely reported cases of idiosyncratic hepatocellular injury. In addition, the cost of troglitazone is much higher than that of other oral antihyperglycemic agents or insulin. Given the available information, troglitazone has limited benefit over oral sulfonylureas or metformin as monotherapy or in combination with oral sulfonylureas. Until additional combination and comparative studies have been done, the agent should be reserved for patients with poor glycemic control receiving high daily doses of insulin.",E,E

A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out in a large number of patients to determine whether medication needs can be reduced by SLIT. Some 136 patients with grass-pollen rhinitis with or without mild asthma were studied. Patients received either placebo or SLIT with a standardized grass-pollen extract administered daily with increasing doses up to 300 IR (index of reactivity) from January to the end of July 1994. During the grass-pollen season, patients were instructed to use medications as required and to visit their doctors in case of asthma. Symptom-medications scores were assessed during the pollen season, and serum-specific IgG4 was measured before and at the end of SLIT. In the SLIT group, drug consumption dropped significantly throughout the pollen season (P < 0.02). Moreover, at the peak of the pollen season, betamethasone consumption was significantly reduced in the SLIT group (P < 0.02). Only one patient in the SLIT group had an asthma attack compared to eight patients in the placebo group (P < 0.02). IgG4 levels increased significantly in the SLIT group (P < 0.001) but without correlation with symptoms. Side-effects were comparable in both groups. This study indicates that SLIT in grass-pollen rhinitis is well tolerated, improves overall clinical symptoms, and reduces drug consumption and the need for oral corticosteroids.",E,E

Participants received oral loratadine (10 or 20 mg), methysergide (4 or 8 mg), or placebo at 1000 and 1700 hours daily. Active drug was administered on Days 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, and 16; placebo was administered on all other days. Drug and dose order were counterbalanced across participants. Food intake, performance, and subjective ratings were measured repeatedly throughout the day. Loratadine had no effect on food intake, performance, or subjective ratings. In contrast, total caloric intake significantly decreased from approximately 3500 kcal during placebo administration to 3065 kcal on the first but not the second day of methysergide administration. Consumption of carbohydrate (p < 0.055), protein, and fat decreased on the first day of methysergide administration. This decrease in food intake was due to a decrease in meal size; the number of meals consumed was not affected. The proportion of calories derived from carbohydrates significantly increased on the first day of methysergide administration. Methysergide also significantly impaired performance of a psychomotor task on the first day of high-dose administration and increased ratings of several subjective measures, including ""Vomiting,"" ""Stomach Pain,"" and ""Miserable."" These results suggest that the anorectic effect occurred as a result of the somatic and mood changes produced by methysergide. In addition, the inability of loratadine to affect food intake indicates that antagonism of central histamine receptors may be responsible for the increases in food intake produced by other antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine).",E,E

It has a direct effect on the local vasculature to promote vasodilatation and increase microvascular permeability and may also initiate the more widely spread neurogenic flare. Quantification of these responses and studies of the mediator mechanisms underlying them have been limited by the lack of appropriate techniques to investigate them. To address this we have used two relatively new techniques, scanning laser Doppler imaging (LDI) and dermal microdialysis to measure changes in skin blood flow and the release of histamine within the weal and flare, following intradermal injection of histamine or bradykinin. These measurements have been made both in the absence and presence of the H1 receptor blockers cetirizine and loratadine. Scanning LDI of the inflammatory response revealed marked differences in both the development and steady state responses to the intradermal injection of histamine (1-3 mumol/L) and bradykinin (1 mumol/L). The development of the flare and the weal response to both histamine and bradykinin was significantly reduced by cetirizine but not by loratadine. The histamine-induced flare area fell by 57 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM, n = 10, P < 0.001) after cetirizine and the area of the weal fell by 73 +/- 11% (P < 0.009). Bradykinin-induced inflammatory responses were similarly reduced by cetirizine, the weal by 60 +/- 16% (P < 0.02) and the flare by 61 +/- 4% (P < 0.005). Measurement of histamine concentration in skin using microdialysis, in six subjects, confirmed that histamine levels rose in the dialysate collected from the weal to 310 +/- 16 nmol/L following injection of histamine. Histamine levels also rose following bradykinin injection in some subjects (mean 147 +/- 46 nmol/L, range 18-336). Little increase in histamine concentration was seen in the dialysate from the flare following injection of either histamine or bradykinin. The histamine concentration in dialysate from unprovoked skin was 4.19 +/- 0.75 nmol/L. These data reveal differences in the dermal responses to different mediators when assessed using scanning LDI. They confirm that histamine is released within the weal but not the flare response to the intradermal injection of both histamine and bradykinin and that its effects on the local vasculature to cause the oedematous weal and the axon reflex-mediated flare are significantly attenuated by the H1 antagonist cetirizine and to a lesser extent by the H1 antagonist loratadine.",I,E

Thirty-eight patients (12-56 years of age) were studied. Nasal and ocular symptoms were recorded daily from days 4 to 7. Skin prick tests with serial concentrations of allergens and one concentration of histamine were carried out before and at the end of the 7-day treatment period. Parallel-line bioassay, analysis of variance, and covariance were used to analyze skin test data. Loratadine and astemizole significantly decreased symptoms from baseline (P < 0.004 and P < 0.006). Skin-test reactivity to allergen and histamine was more profoundly decreased by astemizole than loratadine. The histamine covariant was more important in the allergen effect of astemizole than in that of loratadine. Two H1-blockers having the same clinical effect on nasal and ocular symptoms during the pollen season have totally different effects on skin-test reactivity. Skin-test reactivity to allergen or histamine is not predictive of the clinical efficacy of H1-blockers during seasonal allergic rhinitis.",I,E

Thirty-four patients were randomly allocated to the active group, and 32 received placebo. Immunotherapy consisted of olive-allergen extracts (StallergçŒ«nes SA) administered sublingually pre- and coseasonally from January to July for 2 consecutive years. Serial concentrations from 1 to 300 IR. were used up to the maintenance dose of 20 drops of 300 IR daily. The cumulative dose for each patient was 300 times higher than in parenteral immunotherapy, and the cumulative dose of the major allergen Ole e 1 was 8.1 mg/2 years. The patients were assessed by clinical parameters (symptom and medication scores from patients' daily diaries) and immunologic measurements (specific IgE, IgG4, eosinophil cationic protein [ECP]) were performed. The actively treated patients had a significantly lower score for dyspnea (P<0.04 during the first season; P<0.03 during the second season). At the pollinic peak during the second year, a lower score of conjunctivitis was recorded (P<0.05) in the actively treated patients. The analysis of intragroup evolution showed that the total score of rhinitis increased significantly during the pollinic peak in the group under placebo, whereas there was no symptomatic peak for the same period in the group under active treatment. However, the difference between the groups was not significant. The medication score did not differ significantly between the groups. Oral steroids were the only variables with a P value near the significance level (P=0.06) in favor of the actively treated group. A significant decrease in skin reactivity was recorded in the active group after 2 years of treatment. No significant variation in specific IgE and IgG4 was detected. A significantly lower level of serum ECP was observed at the pollinic peak in the actively treated patients during the first pollen season (P=0.01), but this was not confirmed the second year when the ECP levels doubled in both groups without correlation to the clinical findings. Tolerance was excellent with only a few minor side-effects reported. In conclusion, high-dose specific sublingual immunotherapy appears to be safe and effective in improving mild seasonal asthma and conjunctivitis linked to olive-pollen sensitization.",E,E

Concerning LDF recordings, we noted at the histamine administration site an increase in perfusion unit (PU) values which is an effect known to be in proportion to the degree of inhibition of wheal reaction, and at 1 cm distal to the histamine administration site, there was a decrease in PU values. These changes were more marked under cetirizine. A greater suppressive effect of cetirizine on the wheal and flare reaction was consistently observed at all time points during the study, demonstrating its superior efficacy.; We conclude that (1) cetirizine demonstrated a stronger antihistaminic effect compared to ebastine at all time points; (2) iontophoresis appears to be an appropriate method to study specific microvascular changes at the delivery site of histamine and hence to detect the earliest changes occurring at the site of agonist-antagonist competition in the skin.",I,E

Single-dose pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine were predictive of steady-state pharmacokinetics. Urinary elimination of fexofenadine played a minor role (10%) in the disposition of this drug. A 63:37 steady-state ratio of R(+) and S(-) fexofenadine was observed in plasma. This ratio was essentially constant across time and dose. R(+) and S(-) fexofenadine were eliminated into urine in equal rates and quantities. All doses of fexofenadine HCl were well tolerated after single and multiple-dose administration.",E,E
9930595,In vivo and ex vivo inhibitory effects of loratadine on histamine release in patients with allergic rhinitis.,"Adult; Animals; Basophils; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Female; Histamine H1 Antagonists; Histamine Release; Humans; Loratadine; Male; Middle Aged; Mites; Nasal Mucosa; Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial; Therapeutic Irrigation","Miadonna, A; Cottini, M; Milazzo, N; Tosi, D; Danzig, M; Tedeschi, A","The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo and ex vivo effects of the H1-antagonist loratadine on histamine release.; The study was designed as a double-blind, crossover trial. Ten patients with allergic rhinitis due to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus were treated with loratadine (10 mg daily p.o.) and with placebo for 1 week, with a 2-week interval between the two treatments. Nasal lavages with saline solution were done before and after challenge with the relevant allergen at the end of treatments with loratadine and placebo. Venous blood was taken after treatments, and basophil histamine release induced by anti-IgE (10 microg/ml), N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP, 1 microM), and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (1 microM) was evaluated by an automated fluorometric method.; Treatment with loratadine attenuated early antigen-induced nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and itching. Nasal symptoms were accompanied by a significant histamine release in the nasal lavages collected 5 min after stimulation when the patients received placebo (median 4 ng/ml, range 1-28; P < 0.05). After treatment with loratadine, histamine release in the 5-min postchallenge lavages was almost abrogated (median 0.5 ng/ml, range 0-3; P < 0.01 vs placebo). Median anti-IgE-induced histamine release from basophils was 41.9% (range 27.8-79.2) after placebo and 30.0% (range 1.7-73.3, P < 0.05) after loratadine. Active treatment exerted an inhibitory effect also on basophil histamine release induced by fMLP and Ca2+ ionophore A23187.; Treatment for 1 week with loratadine reduces allergen-induced nasal symptoms and inhibits in vivo and ex vivo histamine release in patients with allergic rhinitis.",I,E
9934406,Comparative study between fluticasone propionate and cetirizine in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.,"Adult; Allergens; Androstadienes; Anti-Allergic Agents; Cetirizine; Dizziness; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Fluticasone; Humans; Male; Pollen; Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial; Treatment Outcome","D'Ambrosio, F P; Gangemi, S; Merendino, R A; Arena, A; Ricciardi, L; Bagnato, G F","Among the most frequently used drugs in the treatment of allergic rhinitis we have to mention topical nasal corticosteroids and H1 antihistamines used both systemically and topically. The present study focused the effectiveness and tolerability of cetirizine and fluticasone propionate in seasonal allergic rhinitis. 54 patients, divided into three homogeneous groups, underwent the following different treatments: Group 1: Placebo of fluticasone (2 puff per nostril once daily by aerosol) + cetirizine (10 mg/die per os) for 60 days. Group 2: Fluticasone (100 mg per nostril once daily by aerosol) + placebo of cetirizine (per os) for 60 days. Group 3: Cetirizine (10 mg/die per os) for 60 days + fluticasone (100 mg per nostril once daily by aerosol) for 20 days. The patients reported nasal symptoms (sneezing, obstruction, itching, rhinorrea) on a clinical diary. ECP levels in nasal secretions were investigated in all patients to determine the anti-inflammatory activity of both treatments. Cetirizine resulted very effective in the treatment of sneezing, itching and acqueous rhinorrea whereas not much effective on nasal obstruction. On the contrary, fluticasone, which acted effectively on nasal obstruction, resulted inefficacious on the other symptoms. The third group of patients achieved the best results on all four symptoms, including obstruction, which continued even after interrupting the treatment with fluticasone. The ECP levels were significantly reduced by both treatments. The side effects in all 3 groups were rare and not serious. From these results we can assert that the synergic action of the two drugs, achieves the best effectiveness, that the fluticasone treatment can be limited to 20 days cycles and finally that both molecules are well tolerated.",E,E
9951950,Second-generation antihistamines: a comparative review.,"Asthma; Dermatitis, Atopic; Drug Interactions; Histamine H1 Antagonists; Humans; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; Urticaria","Slater, J W; Zechnich, A D; Haxby, D G","Second-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines) have been developed to reduce or eliminate the sedation and anticholinergic adverse effects that occur with older H1 receptor antagonists. This article evaluates second-generation antihistamines, including acrivastine, astemizole, azelastine, cetirizine, ebastine, fexofenadine, ketotifen, loratadine, mizolastine and terfenadine, for significant features that affect choice. In addition to their primary mechanism of antagonising histamine at the H1 receptor, these agents may act on other mediators of the allergic reaction. However, the clinical significance of activity beyond that mediated by histamine H1 receptor antagonism has yet to be demonstrated. Most of the agents reviewed are metabolised by the liver to active metabolites that play a significant role in their effect. Conditions that result in accumulation of astemizole, ebastine and terfenadine may prolong the QT interval and result in torsade de pointes. The remaining agents reviewed do not appear to have this risk. For allergic rhinitis, all agents are effective and the choice should be based on other factors. For urticaria, cetirizine and mizolastine demonstrate superior suppression of wheal and flare at the dosages recommended by the manufacturer. For atopic dermatitis, as adjunctive therapy to reduce pruritus, cetirizine, ketotifen and loratadine demonstrate efficacy. Although current evidence does not suggest a primary role for these agents in the management of asthma, it does support their use for asthmatic patients when there is coexisting allergic rhinitis, dermatitis or urticaria.",I,E
