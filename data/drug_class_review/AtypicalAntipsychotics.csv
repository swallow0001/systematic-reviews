10071708,Comparative efficacy of olanzapine and haloperidol for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.,"Adult; Akathisia, Drug-Induced; Analysis of Variance; Antipsychotic Agents; Behavioral Symptoms; Benzodiazepines; Chi-Square Distribution; Double-Blind Method; Drug Resistance; Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced; Female; Haloperidol; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pirenzepine; Prospective Studies; Schizophrenia; Treatment Outcome","Breier, A; Hamilton, S H","There is relatively little information regarding the efficacy of newer atypical antipsychotic drugs for patients with schizophrenia who are treatment-resistant to neuroleptic agents. Several lines of evidence suggest that a clinical trial of olanzapine in this population is warranted.; A subpopulation of patients (n = 526) meeting treatment-resistant criteria selected from a large, prospective, double-blind, 6-week study assessing the efficacy and safety of olanzapine and haloperidol were examined. Both last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) and completers (observed cases) analyses were conducted.; Olanzapine demonstrated significantly greater mean improvement from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative symptoms, comorbid depressive symptoms assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, akathisia as measured by Barnes Akathisia Scale, and extrapyramidal symptoms as measured by Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Rating Scale with both LOCF and completers analyses. In addition, olanzapine was significantly superior to haloperidol for Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total (p = .006), PANSS total (p = .005), and PANSS positive symptoms (p = .017) in completers of the 6-week study. Significantly greater response rates were observed in olanzapine-treated (47%) than haloperidol-treated (35%) patients in the LOCF analysis (p = .008), but significance was not reached in the completers analysis (p = .093). Mean doses (+/- SD) of olanzapine and haloperidol were 11.1 +/- 3.4 mg/day and 10.0 +/- 3.6 mg/day, respectively.; Olanzapine was superior to haloperidol for key symptom domains and parkinsonian side effects. Implications of these data for the therapeutics of this severely ill subgroup are discussed.",I,I

D-Cycloserine significantly worsened ratings of negative symptoms compared to placebo but did not significantly affect ratings of psychotic symptoms.; The differing effects of D-cycloserine on negative symptoms when added to clozapine compared to conventional antipsychotics suggests that activation of the glycine recognition site may play a role in clozapine's efficacy for negative symptoms.",3,E
10072410,Low-dose clozapine for the treatment of drug-induced psychosis in Parkinson's disease.,"Aged; Antiparkinson Agents; Antipsychotic Agents; Clozapine; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Parkinson Disease; Psychoses, Substance-Induced; Treatment Outcome",NA,"Drug-induced psychosis is a difficult problem to manage in patients with Parkinson's disease. Multiple open-label studies have reported that treatment with clozapine at low doses ameliorates psychosis without worsening parkinsonism.; We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of low doses of clozapine (6.25 to 50 mg per day) in 60 patients at six sites over a period of 14 months. The patients (mean age, 72 years) had idiopathic Parkinson's disease and drug-induced psychosis of at least four weeks' duration. All the patients continued to receive fixed doses of antiparkinsonian drugs during the four weeks of the trial. Blood counts were monitored weekly in all the patients.; The mean dose of clozapine was 24.7 mg per day. The patients in the clozapine group had significantly more improvement than those in the placebo group in all three of the measures used to determine the severity of psychosis. The mean (+/-SE) scores on the Clinical Global Impression Scale improved by 1.6+/-0.3 points for the patients receiving clozapine, as compared with 0.5+/-0.2 point for those receiving placebo (P<0.001). The score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale improved by 9.3+/-1.5 points for the patients receiving clozapine, as compared with 2.6+/-1.3 points for those receiving placebo (P=0.002). The score on the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms improved by 11.8+/-2.0 points for the patients receiving clozapine, as compared with 3.8+/-1.9 points for those receiving placebo (P=0.01). Seven patients treated with clozapine had an improvement of at least three on the seven-point Clinical Global Impression Scale, as compared with only one patient given placebo. Clozapine treatment improved tremor and had no deleterious effect on the severity of parkinsonism. In one patient, clozapine was discontinued because of leukopenia.; Clozapine, at daily doses of 50 mg or less, is safe and significantly improves drug-induced psychosis without worsening parkinsonism.",I,4

10072664,Comparison of risperidone and mosapramine addition to neuroleptic treatment in chronic schizophrenia.,"Adult; Analysis of Variance; Antipsychotic Agents; Behavioral Symptoms; Benzazepines; Chronic Disease; Cross-Over Studies; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Risperidone; Schizophrenia; Single-Blind Method; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome","Takahashi, N; Terao, T; Oga, T; Okada, M","There is little information regarding the effects of risperidone addition to neuroleptic treatment in chronic schizophrenia. As a preliminary study, 10 neuroleptic-treated schizophrenic inpatients received risperidone (high 5HT2A/D2 ratio, i.e. the ratio between 5HT2A and D2 receptor occupancy) and mosapramine (low 5HT2A/D2 ratio) in a randomized, single-blind, crossover, add-on study consisting of 8 weeks of treatment each with risperidone and mosapramine. Although both additions resulted in significant, albeit modest, improvement, there was no significant difference in the scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia between risperidone and mosapramine addition. These results suggest that risperidone and mosapramine bring about comparable effects in add-on design. Thus, risperidone with a high 5HT2A/D2 ratio does not seem to be better than mosapramine with a low 5HT2A/D2 ratio when combined with conventional neuroleptics. Further studies including a large number of patients and a double-blind design are needed.",I,4

Our group has demonstrated that memory impairment is associated with poor psychosocial outcome and treatment resistance. Work on the classical amnesic syndrome has suggested that memory training is facilitated by adopting an 'errorless learning' approach, where subjects do not experience failure during learning. This is based on the theory that the preserved implicit memory of amnesic patients results in implicitly remembered incorrect responses interfering with target items, in the absence of a functioning explicit memory system to allow differentiation.; We compared three groups of subjects, memory-impaired schizophrenic patients, memory unimpaired schizophrenic patients and healthy controls.; An errorless learning approach conferred a significant advantage on the memory-impaired schizophrenic group, bringing their performance up to the level of both control groups. In contrast, adopting a traditional trial and error, or errorful approach resulted in markedly impaired performance in the memory-impaired schizophrenic group only.; We conclude that errorless learning approaches may be worthy of further evaluation in the cognitive rehabilitation of memory-impaired schizophrenic patients.",5,E

The sample for the relapse analyses consisted of 104 patients who responded to treatment of their index episode and were at risk for relapse.; Five years after initial recovery, the cumulative first relapse rate was 81.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.6%-93.2%); the second relapse rate was 78.0% (95% CI, 46.5%-100.0%). By 4 years after recovery from a second relapse, the cumulative third relapse rate was 86.2% (95% CI, 61.5%-100.0%). Discontinuing antipsychotic drug therapy increased the risk of relapse by almost 5 times (hazard ratio for an initial relapse, 4.89 [99% CI, 2.49-9.60]; hazard ratio for a second relapse, 4.57 [99% CI, 1.49-14.02]). Subsequent analyses controlling for antipsychotic drug use showed that patients with poor premorbid adaptation to school and premorbid social withdrawal relapsed earlier. Sex, diagnosis, obstetric complications, duration of psychotic illness before treatment, baseline symptoms, neuroendocrine measures, methylphenidate hydrochloride challenge response, neuropsychologic and magnetic resonance imaging measures, time to response of the initial episode, adverse effects during treatment, and presence of residual symptoms after the initial episode were not significantly related to time to relapse.; There is a high rate of relapse within 5 years of recovery from a first episode of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. This risk is diminished by maintenance antipsychotic drug treatment.",I,6

Each patient was randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg/day, 1 mg/day, or 2 mg/day of risperidone for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease rating scale (BEHAVE-AD).; The study was completed by 70% of the patients. Baseline Functional Assessment Staging scores were 6 or 7 in more than 95% of the patients, indicating severe dementia. At endpoint, significantly greater reductions in BEHAVE-AD total scores and psychosis and aggressiveness subscale scores were seen in patients receiving 1 and 2 mg/day of risperidone than in placebo patients (p = .005 and p < .001, respectively). At week 12, 0.5 mg/day of risperidone was superior to placebo in reducing BEHAVE-AD aggression scores (p = .02). More adverse events were reported by patients receiving 2 mg/day of risperidone than 1 mg/day. The most common dose-related adverse events were extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, and mild peripheral edema. The frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms in patients receiving 1 mg/day of risperidone was not significantly greater than in placebo patients.; Risperidone significantly improved symptoms of psychosis and aggressive behavior in patients with severe dementia. Results show that 1 mg/day of risperidone is an appropriate dose for most elderly patients with dementia.",I,I

Among the serotonin receptors, the serotonin 2A (5HT2A) receptor subtype is the most widely studied. Previous studies on the association between a silent mutation polymorphism of the 5HT2A gene (102T/C) and schizophrenia or clozapine response have yielded conflicting findings. Therefore, we investigated whether these genetic variants of the 5HT2A receptor are associated with schizophrenia or with response to clozapine treatment in a Chinese population. Ninety-seven schizophrenic patients and 101 control subjects were included in the study. The receptor variants were found at similar frequencies in schizophrenic patients and healthy control subjects. Also, we did not find the variants to influence the response to clozapine in schizophrenic patients. We suggest that the assessment method of clozapine response and the ethnicity may influence the result.",5,E

Factors associated with maximum EPS severity were increasing risperidone dose (< or = 8 mg/day was similar to placebo), lower baseline EPS scores, and longer duration of psychotic symptoms, particularly in older patients. EPS severity was significantly greater in patients receiving haloperidol or other antipsychotics than in those receiving risperidone (4 to 8 mg/day) or placebo. Antiparkinsonian medications were required by significantly fewer patients treated with risperidone (4 to 8 mg/day) than by patients treated with haloperidol or other antipsychotics. Combined efficacy data showed that 4 to 8 mg/day was also the most efficacious dose range; there was no increase in efficacy with doses over 4 mg/day. Based on these data and post-marketing experience, 4 mg/day is an appropriate initial target dose for most patients with schizophrenia. Higher doses may be appropriate for patients with chronic illness, and lower doses may be appropriate for patients with a first psychotic episode or for elderly patients.",I,5
10155617,Measuring the costs of schizophrenia. Implications for the post-institutional era in the US.,Adult; Cost of Illness; Deinstitutionalization; Health Policy; Humans; Schizophrenia; United States,"Terkelsen, K G; Menikoff, A","Schizophrenia is a stress-related biomedical condition of the brain, characterised by unusual internal experiences, severe and often persistent functional disability and socially inappropriate behaviour. It is estimated that schizophrenia affects approximately 1% of all adults worldwide. Young adults are especially vulnerable. It is an illness with profound economic impact on patients, their families and society at large. Before the 1950s, most patients with schizophrenia were admitted to hospital for long inpatient stays. Keeping the patient in an institutional setting was all that psychiatry could offer, because there was little active treatment available. After World War II, and especially following the introduction of chlorpromazine in 1954, treatment was offered increasingly in outpatient settings. At present, more than 90% of individuals with schizophrenia will receive most healthcare services in outpatient facilities, supplemented by brief hospital treatment. The trend toward community-based care continues into the 1990s, supported in part by recent pharmacotherapeutic developments that are making a new generation of drug treatment options available. Clozapine, the most widely used of these new drugs, has been the subject of several studies that compared its costs with those of conventional drug treatments. These early studies suggest that further reductions in the cost of hospital treatment are possible in the near future. At the same time, despite the increasing availability of effective treatment in outpatient settings, the shift of resources from institutional to community care will not occur as quickly as some might wish. Delays in the transformation of care systems are caused by political interest groups and the sheer inertia of the infrastructure left over from the era of institutional care. These factors must be taken into account in estimating the cost of schizophrenia care during the next decade. The aim of this review is to provide a clinical picture of schizophrenia, emphasising features that contribute most to the cost of illness. We define and quantify the direct and indirect costs of the illness, discuss the cost implications of new pharmacotherapeutic and psychosocial treatments, and critique strategies for measuring the economic efficacy of these new treatments. The difficulties in measuring the costs of schizophrenia that are related to the transition from institutional to community-based systems of care in the US are also reviewed.",5,E
10172917,Measuring quality of life in patients with schizophrenia.,Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Quality of Life; Schizophrenic Psychology,"Awad, A G; Voruganti, L N; Heslegrave, R J","Schizophrenia is a chronic disabling illness that affects about 1% of the population. It is a heterogenous disorder with variable aetiological, prognostic and treatment response patterns. Its course is generally long term, with acute psychotic exacerbations that may require hospitalisation. The cornerstone of clinical management is the use of antipsychotic (neuroleptic) medications. Although these are effective, they can cause adverse effects that may impact negatively on the functional status of the individual. Early studies of quality of life in schizophrenia were mainly concerned with the development of techniques to identify patients' needs in the community. Difficulties encountered in these studies included: lack of agreement on definition of quality of life; lack of appropriate integrative conceptual models; concerns about reliability of patients' self-reports about their quality of life; and the lack of standardised quality-of-life measures appropriate for schizophrenia. A number of disease-specific or generic scales have subsequently been used for measurement of quality of life in schizophrenia. The list of disease-specific scales is extensive; unfortunately, many of them were used only in a single study or their psychometric properties were not specified. Generic scales can be applied across various types and severity of illness, as well as in different health interventions across demographic and cultural groups. Medication costs in schizophrenia represent only a small fraction of the total cost of the illness. However, pharmacoeconomic studies have attracted much interest as a result of the high cost of newly introduced medications and of concern about the limitations of antipsychotic medications, particularly their adverse effects, as exemplified by the reintroduction of clozapine for the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. Few studies have combined quality-of-life measures with cost analysis in schizophrenia; a number of these have methodological shortcomings. Many studies are retrospective in nature, and in most the number and length of hospitalisations has been used as the parameter for cost analysis, which can introduce bias depending on the varying approaches to hospitalisation. We conclude that the following factors are important in choosing or developing a quality-of-life measure for schizophrenia: quality of life is a multidimensional concept that has to be reflected in its measurement; the scale has to be appropriate for the purpose as well as the population studied; measurement has to include patients' self-reports about their quality of life; measures should include only items that are relevant and expected to change; single-item global measures are useful only when combined with multidimensional measures; in developing new scales, psychometric properties have to be established as well as being field-tested.",I,5

Patient charts from a large psychiatric group practice were reviewed, and hospital billing data were obtained. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were placed into one of two cohorts depending on their medication history. Thirty patients treated with risperidone met the selection criteria, and a random quota sampling technique was used to allow for a matched control cohort of 30 patients treated with haloperidol. In the haloperidol and risperidone cohorts, 24 and 28 patients, respectively, were evaluated statistically. Mean utilization rates and costs per patient per month for each service were estimated by using regression analysis. Patients in the risperidone cohort had significantly fewer hospitalizations than did those in the haloperidol cohort (P = 0.004). Likewise, risperidone patients had significantly lower hospitalization costs than haloperidol patients (P = 0.005). Conversely, patients treated with risperidone visited the physician more frequently than did those treated with haloperidol (P = 0.0005). Estimated mean total monthly costs were $123.34 lower (95% confidence interval = $464, $217) per patient in the risperidone cohort than in the haloperidol cohort ($1,636.11 vs $1759.45; P = 0.4693). Significant reductions in hospital costs in the risperidone cohort offset higher medication and physician costs. Overall, total monthly costs were similar for the two cohorts.",2,E

Both doses of ziprasidone were statistically significantly more effective than placebo in improving the PANSS total, BPRS total, BPRS core items, CGI-S, and PANSS negative subscale scores (p < .05). Ziprasidone 160 mg/day significantly improved depressive symptoms in patients with clinically significant depression at baseline (MADRS > or = 14, over-all mean 23.5) (p < .05) as compared with placebo. The percentage of patients experiencing adverse events was similar in each treatment group, and resultant discontinuation was rare. The most frequent adverse events associated with ziprasidone were generally mild dyspepsia, nausea, dizziness, and transient somnolence. Ziprasidone was shown to have a very low liability for inducing movement disorders and weight gain. The results indicate that ziprasidone is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of the positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.",I,I

Our results suggest that the polymorphism does not contribute to the etiology or clinical characteristics of schizophrenia. However, the gene is greater than 20 kbp in length, and thus it is possible that other areas that affect expression of the gene may vary. We found that the -1438G/A variant was in linkage disequilibrium with the T102C polymorphism.",5,E

In contrast, women with schizophrenia in the NHIS data set had a significantly (p<.001) higher mean BMI than did women without schizophrenia (27.36 vs. 24.50, respectively). Moreover, each decile was higher for women with schizophrenia than for women without schizophrenia. Analysis of the ziprasidone and NHANES III data sets revealed that, on average, men with schizophrenia have mean BMIs comparable to those of men without schizophrenia (26.79 vs. 26.52, respectively). In these 2 data sets, women with schizophrenia also had a mean BMI similar to those of women without schizophrenia (27.29 vs. 27.39, respectively).; Although there may be a small subpopulation of schizophrenic individuals who are underweight, individuals with schizophrenia were, on the whole, as obese as or more obese than individuals without schizophrenia, suggesting that weight gain induced by antipsychotic agents is an important concern for many individuals.",6,E

We therefore attempt to provide a comprehensive and critical summary of existing case reports and of studies of breast-feeding in relation to commonly used psychotropic drugs. The literature review focuses on the following drugs: antidepressants: tricyclics and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); antipsychotic drugs: chlorpromazine, perphenazine, haloperidol and clozapine; mood stabilizers: lithium and carbamazepine; and benzodiazepines. The research literature consists mainly of single case reports and there have been very few attempts at controlled, longitudinal investigations. Findings are often difficult to compare because of differences in methods or because of lack of key information. Most data are available about the tricyclic antidepressants but even here we have found that the reports cover only a grand total of 66 mother-infant pairs. Dilemmas about whether or not to contraindicate breast-feeding arise most commonly in relation to postnatal depression. The findings to date suggest that provided that infants are healthy at the outset it is likely that the benefits of breast-feeding will outweigh potential hazards if their mothers are taking established tricyclic drugs at recommended dose levels. Much less is known about risks associated with SSRI antidepressants or about antipsychotic drugs such as phenothiazines and butyrophenones or mood stabilizers such as carbamazepine, all of which enter breast-milk. Safeguards are suggested for future single case studies, which, as they accumulate, will provide a platform for mounting controlled prospective studies properly to test for any acute toxic effects and for possible long-term adverse effects of such drugs on infants' development. Appendix 1 is a review of assay methods. Appendix 2 examines pharmacokinetic factors in newborn preterm and sick infants with special reference to contraindications to breast-feeding.

In this study, we report the first direct comparison of the effect of clozapine and typical neuroleptic drugs on cognitive function in neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients with recent onset, neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to either clozapine (n = 35) or typical neuroleptics (n = 29) and followed for 12 months. They were administered a comprehensive cognitive test battery at baseline and at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after initiating drug treatment. Treatment with clozapine improved psychomotor speed and attention [Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)] and verbal fluency [Category Instance Generation and Controlled Word Association Test (CWAT)] at 6 weeks. The improvement in these measures was maintained throughout the 12-month period. Treatment with typical neuroleptics produced no sustained improvement in any cognitive measure, except for a tendency to improve delayed recall memory (Verbal List Learning Test). The improvement in the DSST and CWAT was significantly greater with clozapine treatment compared to that with typical neuroleptics. These improvements were not related to improvement in psychopathology. These results suggest that clozapine is superior to typical neuroleptics in improving specific types of cognitive function in recent onset, neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenia.",I,I

After data acquisition, the processed data were digitally filtered and the spatial distribution of dipoles was determined by a 3-D convolution with a Gaussian envelope. The dipole localisation was calculated by the dipole density plot and the principal component analysis. The target parameters were absolute dipole values and the dipole localisations. The relationship between absolute dipole values, dipole localisations and psychopathological findings (documented by the use of the PANSS, BPRS-scale) during a 3 week period with constant doses of clozapine and haloperidol was investigated using correlation analysis.; Our results lend strong support to the assumption of a significant elevation of absolute dipole values [dipole density maximum (Dmax), dipole number (Dtotal), absolute and relative dipole density] in the fast frequency range (12.5-30 Hz) over the left hemisphere, especially in the temporoparietal region by clozapine. In this area, we found a dipole concentration effect only in patients treated with the atypical neuroleptic, whereas the dipole distribution in patients treated with haloperidol and healthy controls was concentrated in the central region. With regard to the absolute dipole values in the frequency ranges 2-6 Hz (delta, theta) and 7.5-12 Hz (alpha), we found no statistically significant differences between the groups investigated. In the slow frequency range (2-6 Hz) no difference was found between the clozapine and haloperidol group for the dipole localisation, which predominated in the temporoparietal region, in contrast to the central dipole distribution in control subjects.; The results of an increase in beta activity under clozapine demonstrate a smaller reduction in activity in terms of unspecific sensory and motor paradigms in comparison with typical neuroleptics. The temporoparietal concentration of dipoles, in particular over the left half of the brain, might illustrate either their special role in the disease process, or the effects of the medication. The latter possibility was supported by the differing dipole distribution in the clozapine group with a left temporoparietal centre in both frequency ranges, and a deviating central dipole localisation in the fast activity range in the haloperidol group.",2,E

After a 2- to 4-day screening period, qualified patients were assigned to either olanzapine (N = 70) or placebo (N = 69). Patients began double-blind therapy with either olanzapine, 10 mg, or placebo given once per day. After the first day of treatment, the daily dose could be adjusted upward or downward, as clinically indicated, by one capsule (olanzapine, 5 mg/day) within the allowed range of one to four capsules. The primary efficacy measure in the protocol was defined as a change from baseline to endpoint in total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale. Clinical response was defined a priori as a decrease of 50% or more from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale total score.; The olanzapine group experienced significantly greater mean improvement in Young Mania Rating Scale total score than the placebo group. On the basis of the clinical response criteria, significantly more olanzapine-treated patients (48.6%) responded than those assigned to placebo (24.2%). Somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, and weight gain occurred significantly more often with olanzapine. There were no statistically significant differences between the olanzapine-treated and placebo-treated patients with respect to measures of parkinsonism, akathisia, and dyskinesias. No discontinuations of treatment due to adverse events occurred in the olanzapine treatment group.; The results from this study suggest that compared with placebo, olanzapine has superior efficacy for the symptoms of acute mania.",I,I

Clozapine, an atypical neuroleptic drug, has been reported to improve postural Parkinson's disease tremor clinically resembling ET. The effects of a single dose of 12.5 mg clozapine and placebo were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in 15 drug-resistant patients with ET. Patient responders with more than 50% improvement after a single dose of clozapine subsequently received the drug (39+/-9 mg up to 50 mg) unblinded for a period of 15.8+/-7.7 months. Tremor was effectively reduced by a single dose of clozapine in 13 of 15 patients (p <0.01). Sedation was the only side effect reported during the clozapine test; however, the time course of sedation and of the antitremor effect were not coincident. A significant reduction of tremor was reported with chronic clozapine treatment (p <0.01) with no tolerance to drug antitremor effect, whereas sedation markedly decreased after 6-7 weeks of therapy. No clozapine-induced hematologic side effects were observed in our cohort of patients during long-term treatment.

Akathisia has also been associated with symptom exacerbation. This study addressed four questions: 1) Does akathisia predict greater severity in global psychopathology? 2) Is this effect global or specific? 3) Does clozapine treatment alter this relationship? 4) Does severity of psychopathology covary with the level of akathisia?; Akathisia and clinical symptoms were examined in 33 ""treatment refractory"" schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine across 16 weeks. Weekly ratings were Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, Abbreviated Dyskinesia Rating Scale, and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Patients were classified as ""with"" (n = 15) or ""without"" (n = 18) akathisia. Data analyses involved independent t-test comparisons of selected variables, between-group multivariate analyses of variance across time for BPRS Total scores and Guy's five factors, and partial correlations to assess covariation between BPRS scores and level of akathisia.; Akathisia predicted more severe global psychopathology, specific to the Activation (AC) and Thought Disturbance (TH) factors. These relationships did not change with clozapine treatment even when akathisia declined. Interestingly, level of akathisia did not covary with severity of psychopathology.; In this sample, akathisia predicted more severe psychopathology, specific to AC and TH BPRS factor scores. Clozapine treatment did not alter this relationship. Although the presence of akathisia predicted more severe symptoms, the level of akathisia did not covary across time with severity of psychopathology, suggesting an ""uncoupling"" of these symptom domains.",6,E

Outcomes were compared among those with many days in the hospital use (hereafter, high hospital users) (n = 141; mean = 215 psychiatric hospital days in the year prior to study entry) and those with few days in the hospital use (hereafter, low hospital users) (n = 282; mean = 58 hospital days). Analyses were conducted with the full intention-to-treat sample (n = 423) and with crossovers excluded (n = 291).; Clozapine treatment resulted in greater reduction in hospital use among high hospital users (35 days less than controls, P = .02) than among low users (21 days less than controls, P = .05). Patients taking clozapine also had lower health care costs; after including the costs of both medications and other health services, costs were $7134 less than for controls among high hospital users (P = .14) but only $759 less than for controls among low hospital users (P = .82). Clinical improvement in the domains of symptoms, quality of life, extrapyramidal symptoms, and a synthetic measure of multiple outcomes favored clozapine in both high and low hospital user groups.; Substantial 1-year cost savings with clozapine are observed only among patients with very high hospital use prior to initiation of treatment while clinical benefits are more similar across groups.

Although such symptoms have been most strongly associated with dopaminergic hypoactivity in the prefrontal cortex, other neurotransmitters including norepinephrine, serotonin, and the excitatory amino acids may also play a role. In some patients moderate doses of conventional neuroleptics clearly improve negative symptoms; the response of such symptoms is relatively greater with clozapine and probably with certain serotonin-dopamine antagonists. Recent studies demonstrating improvement of negative symptoms when conventional neuroleptics are augmented with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or with agents active at the glycine-modulatory site of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex suggest that further amelioration of primary negative symptoms may be possible through pharmacological strategies involving multiple neurotransmitter systems.",5,E

Research has shown that improvements in cognitive functioning occur independently of improvements in positive or negative clinical symptoms, and whereas typical antipsychotics may improve clinical symptoms, they have little or no efficacy in improving cognitive dysfunction. However, there is evidence that the atypical antipsychotic clozapine may improve this core deficit of schizophrenia. This review summarizes 12 published studies that assessed the effect of clozapine on cognitive functioning. As a group, these studies suggest that psychomotor speed, verbal fluency, and verbal learning and memory may be improved by treatment with clozapine.

As olanzapine is a drug with a very similar biochemical profile to clozapine, it is important to evaluate whether non-response to olanzapine predicts clozapine non-response.; Forty-four treatment-resistant patients received eight weeks of olanzapine, either in a double-blind trial or subsequent open treatment at a mean daily dose of 25 mg/day. Two of 44 patients (5%) responded to olanzapine treatment. Patients who did not respond could then receive clozapine. Twenty-seven subsequently received an 8-week open trial of clozapine.; Patients who did and did not receive clozapine did not differ demographically or in psychopathology. Eleven of 27 (41%) met a priori response criteria during clozapine treatment (mean dose 693 mg/day) after failing to respond to olanzapine.; This study demonstrates that failure to respond to olanzapine treatment does not predict failure to clozapine.

Patients slept for 5 consecutive nights in the sleep unit as follows: one acclimatization night; two baseline nights (the first for sleep disorder screenings); and two olanzapine nights (10 mg olanzapine, one hour before sleep onset).; Sleep continuity variables and total sleep time showed an overall improvement with olanzapine. Waking time was reduced since the first night of olanzapine administration. The main sleep architecture changes were: reduction in sleep stage 1, while sleep stage 2 and delta were significantly enhanced. Rapid eye movement density was also increased by the second olanzapine night.; Total sleep improvement was due to the increase in sleep stages 2 and delta sleep.

The study was based on both a review of all 31 patients' charts and a structured interview of 26 of the patients. The change to risperidone had been made because of lack of efficacy or intolerance to typical antipsychotic agents after a mean of 3.5 years of therapy. Patients had been maintained on risperidone for a mean of 1.7 years at the time of the review. The impact of switching to risperidone was assessed by comparing clinical variables for the patients with their own historic control data. The current levels of symptoms, side effects, and social functioning were also assessed by means of the Interview for Retrospective Assessment of Onset of Schizophrenia and rating scales. Seventy-one percent and 81% of the patients exhibited a positive response, as measured by a 30% reduction in psychotic and disorganization syndromes, respectively. After the switch, significant declines were noted in service utilization; the level of psychotic, disorganization, and negative symptom dimensions; and the use of anticholinergic drugs (P < 0.01 for all). Assessments conducted at the time of the review revealed a low level of psychotic (mean, 3.5) and disorganization (mean, 3.0) symptoms, a moderate level of negative symptoms (mean, 19.5), and a low level of extrapyramidal symptoms (total mean parkinsonism score, 6.0). No significant changes were seen in the level of employment or in living conditions. Results of this study suggest that a switch to risperidone therapy because of the inefficacy of typical antipsychotic agents or patients' inability to tolerate them may lead to sustained and significant improvement in a substantial proportion of patients with schizophrenia.",5,E

At least two independent reviewers assessed trials for inclusion in the study and extracted data for meta-analysis.; The review included 2,530 randomly assigned participants in 30 trials, most of them short-term. Clozapine-treated patients showed more clinical improvement and experienced significantly fewer relapses during treatment, although the risk of blood dyscrasias in long-term treatment may be as high as 7%. Scores on symptom rating scales showed greater improvement among clozapine-treated patients, who were also more satisfied with their treatment. However, there was no evidence that the superior clinical effect of clozapine is reflected in levels of functioning; on the other hand, global functional and pragmatic outcomes were frequently not reported. Clinical improvement was most pronounced in patients with treatment-resistant illness.; This meta-analysis confirms that clozapine is more effective than conventional neuroleptics in reducing symptoms of patients with both treatment-resistant and nonresistant schizophrenia. Future trials should be long-term pragmatic community trials or should address the effectiveness of clozapine in special patient populations. An international standard set of outcomes, including pragmatic assessments of functioning, would greatly enhance the comparison and summation of trials and future assessments of effectiveness.",I,6

We hypothesized that the unique pharmacodynamic profiles of these agents would contribute to different amounts and patterns of weight gain.; Data were analyzed to determine differences in weight gain during treatment among patients receiving 5 different drug treatments (clozapine [N = 20], olanzapine [N = 13], risperidone [N = 38], haloperidol [N = 43], and sertindole [N = 8]). Measures of maximal weight gain, final weight, and duration to maximal weight gain were calculated.; Repeated measures analyses of variance controlling for age, treatment duration, and initial weight revealed statistically significant differences between groups on all 3 measures. Clozapine and olanzapine had the greatest maximal weight gain liability (F = 4.13, df = 4,23; p = .01). Weight gain with clozapine, but not olanzapine or risperidone, appears to persist (as reflected by final weight) despite behavioral interventions (e.g., nutritional consultation, suggested exercise regimen; F = 5.69, df = 4,23; p = .003). Clozapine- and olanzapine-treated subjects appeared to gain weight over a prolonged period of time, whereas risperidone-and sertindole-treated subjects had a more limited period of weight gain (F = 2.95, df = 4,25; p = .04).; Clozapine and olanzapine caused the most weight gain, risperidone was intermediate, and sertindole had less associated weight gain than haloperidol.

After a comprehensive search of study reports, the response and dropout rates of patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic drug and those treated with placebo were extracted on the intention-to-treat basis. The effect size with 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) of pooled data comparing the response and dropout rates of an atypical antipsychotic drug group and those of a placebo group were calculated by using the Peto method. The response-rate effect sizes (95% CIs) of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone were 1.75 (1.06 to 2.89), 1.71 (1.20 to 2.42), and 3.28 (1.98 to 5.44), respectively.

To clarify our understanding of the effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs on neurocognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia, we have (1) reported on newly established standards for research design in studies of treatment effects on cognitive function in schizophrenia, (2) reviewed the literature on this topic and determined the extent to which 15 studies on the effect of atypical antipsychotics met these standards, (3) performed a meta-analysis of the 15 studies, which suggested general cognitive enhancement with atypical antipsychotics, and (4) described the pharmacological profile of these agents and considered the pharmacological basis for their effects on neurocognition.

The study design included a baseline phase and two double-blind phases in which patients were randomly assigned to medication under two different dose conditions (fixed dose and flexible dose). Secondary memory was assessed at baseline, fixed-dose, and flexible-dose phases, using the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Six measures were selected, which formed three factors (general verbal learning ability, retention, and learning strategy). Risperidone-treated patients showed greater improvement than haloperidol-treated patients in general verbal learning ability, a finding characterized by significant treatment effects on CVLT measures of learning acquisition, recall consistency, and recognition memory. After controlling for benztropine status, differences on the measures of learning acquisition and recall consistency remained significant, and differences in recognition memory weakened slightly (p = 0.07).

Antecedents of this impairment are evident in childhood. The cognitive disability is nearly fully developed at the first episode of psychosis in most patients. The contribution of cognitive impairment to outcome in schizophrenia, especially work function, has been established. Preliminary results indicate that cognitive function, along with disorganization symptoms, discriminate schizophrenia patients who are able to work full-time from those who are not. Typical neuroleptic drugs lack the ability to improve the various domains of cognitive function impaired in schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotic drugs pharmacologically related to clozapine-quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, sertindole, and ziprasidone--share the ability to produce fewer extrapyramidal symptoms than typical neuroleptic drugs and more potent antagonism of serotonin2a relative to dopamine2 receptors. However, they have a number of different clinical effects. We have identified all the studies of clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone that provide data on their effects on cognition in schizophrenia. Data for each drug are reviewed separately in order to identify differences among them in their effects on cognition. Twelve studies that report cognitive effects of clozapine are reviewed. These studies provide (1) strong evidence that clozapine improves attention and verbal fluency and (2) moderate evidence that clozapine improves some types of executive function. However, results of the effects of clozapine on working memory and secondary verbal and spatial memory were inconclusive. Risperidone has relatively consistent positive effects on working memory, executive functioning, and attention, whereas improvement in verbal learning and memory was inconsistent. Preliminary evidence presented here suggests that olanzapine improves verbal learning and memory, verbal fluency, and executive function, but not attention, working memory, or visual learning and memory. Thus, atypical antipsychotic drugs as a group appear to be superior to typical neuroleptics with regard to cognitive function. However, available data suggest that these drugs produce significant differences in specific cognitive functions. These differences may be valuable adjunctive guides for their use in clinical practice if cognitive improvements reach clinical significance. The effects of the atypical antipsychotic drugs on cholinergic and 5-HT2a-mediated neurotransmission as the possible basis for their ability to improve cognition are discussed. It is suggested that the development of drugs for schizophrenia should focus on improving the key cognitive deficits in schizophrenia: executive function, verbal fluency, working memory, verbal and visual learning and memory, and attention.",I,5

Most of the larger studies have concentrated on group treatments designed without the benefit of recent laboratory-based studies. The current study describes a randomized trial of an intensive cognitive remediation program involving individual daily sessions of 1 hour for up to 3 months. It targets executive functioning deficits (cognitive flexibility, working memory, and planning) that are known to be problematic in people with schizophrenia. Procedural learning, as well as the principles of errorless learning, targeted reinforcement, and massed practice, was the basis of the intervention. The program was compared with an alternative therapy (intensive occupational therapy) to control for some of the effects of therapeutic contact. Some improvements in cognition followed both therapies. A differential effect in favor of cognitive remediation therapy was found for tests in the cognitive flexibility and the memory subgroups. There was a trend for those receiving atypical antipsychotic medication to benefit more from cognitive remediation for tests of cognitive flexibility. Although there were no consistent changes in symptoms or social functioning between groups, if improvement in cognitive flexibility tasks reached a threshold then there is some evidence that social functioning improved, even over the short duration of the trial. In addition, cognitive remediation differentially improved self-esteem. This study supports the view that cognitive remediation can reduce cognitive deficits and that this reduction may affect social outcome, at least in the short term.",3,E

The new atypicals are beginning to supplant the older typical neuroleptic antipsychotics, and the scientific and ethical issues raised by this transition prompted the workshop. Given the apparent, albeit not fully defined, advantages of atypical drugs, particularly their safety profiles, the question is whether more comparisons with typical antipsychotics are warranted and whether clinical trial designs warrant (or would be justified in) the inclusion of typical drugs as standard active comparators.

Low smoking cessation rates and reports that some smokers with schizophrenia experience an acute increase in symptoms during attempts to quit smoking, suggest a self-medication model. Alternatively, smoking may modulate medication side effects. The effects of treated and untreated smoking abstinence on psychotic symptoms and medication side effects were examined in this study. Nineteen outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated in a randomized, double-blind, balanced crossover study: 1 day of ad libitum smoking followed by 3 days of acute smoking abstinence while wearing 22 mg/day active or placebo transdermal nicotine patches, with a return to 3 days of smoking between patch conditions. Daily symptom and side-effect ratings, nicotine and cotinine blood levels were collected. Twelve subjects completed the study. Neither positive symptoms nor mood symptoms changed. An increase in negative symptoms during the first abstinent day occurred in both placebo and active patch conditions, but was not sustained over subsequent abstinent days. Despite physiological signs of withdrawal, completers did not endorse increased nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Dropouts reported higher withdrawal symptoms, but also had no increase in psychiatric symptoms in either phase of the study. Of note, dyskinesias decreased during abstinence and placebo patch treatment, but increased during abstinence and the active patch conditions. Acute exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms is an unlikely explanation for any difficulty smokers with schizophrenia have in early abstinence.",3,E

Therefore, stimulation of these receptors could be of benefit to patients with schizophrenia. D-cycloserine has been used for this purpose. This study reports the effects of 100 mg D-cycloserine, when added to typical antipsychotics in chronic schizophrenic patients exhibiting prominent negative symptoms, using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel, design. D-cycloserine slightly worsened psychotic symptoms and general psychopathology as compared to placebo. D-cycloserine failed to change negative symptoms and had no effect on extrapyramidal symptoms. The exacerbation of schizophrenic symptoms may be explained by the antagonistic effects of this dose of D-cycloserine at the glycine recognition site of the NMDA receptor due to competition with the endogenous agonist glycine. Another explanation for the increase in psychopathology may be an interaction with the effects of antipsychotics on NMDA mediated neurotransmission. Thus, D-cycloserine in this study did not ameliorate schizophrenic symptoms. However, the fact that they actually worsened suggests that NMDA systems may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Further placebo-controlled studies with lower dosages of D-cycloserine, preferably in drug-free patients, are necessary to evaluate if D-cycloserine is of use for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia.",5,E

Additionally, with olanzapine treatment there were significant improvements (p < .001) in baseline to endpoint Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) psychotic item scores, with the largest effect sizes observed for hallucinatory behavior, unusual thought content, suspiciousness/persecution, and delusions. During the acute phase of the trial, quality of life was correlated significantly with baseline conceptual disorganization (p = .038) and unusual thought content (p = .023), and time spent in the hospital was correlated with unusual thought content (p = .005).; The implications of these for the clinical management of schizophrenia are discussed.",I,5

The atypical antipsychotic medication clozapine appears to improve tardive dystonia associated with conventional neuroleptic use. We studied the efficacy of clozapine for severe dystonia in five patients in an open trial. The patient cohort included four with generalized dystonia and one with Meige syndrome. All patients were evaluated at baseline and at least weekly while on medication with subjective assessment of response by the patient and physician rating using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Evaluation Scale for Dystonia. All five subjects had significant improvement detected by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Evaluation Scale as well as subjective improvement while on clozapine. Side effects, such as sedation and orthostatic hypotension, developed in all patients but was only treatment-limiting in one subject who developed persistent symptomatic orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia. Two of the four remaining patients continued clozapine after completion of the study; an additional patient was uncertain if the benefit outweighed the side effects. One patient discontinued treatment because of difficulty obtaining the FDA-required weekly white blood cell counts for patients on clozapine. We conclude that clozapine appears to be effective for generalized and refractory focal dystonia although its use may be limited by the side effects and need for hematologic monitoring.",4,E

Differences between treatment groups were assessed according to a pattern-mix random-regression model. An additional analysis compared group differences in rating scale scores against relative time in the study.; Significant between-group differences were found in scores on all rating scales except the Hamilton depression scale. Total medication use over 1 year significantly decreased in the clozapine group. No significant differences between groups in somatic complaints were noted. The subjects with nonpsychotic bipolar I disorder who received clozapine showed a degree of improvement similar to that of the entire clozapine-treated group. Clozapine dose was significantly higher for the patients with schizoaffective illness than for those with bipolar disorder.; The results of this study support clozapine's independent mood-stabilizing property.

These subjects had been admitted to 2 state psychiatric hospitals owing to severe self-mutilation and/or violence and subsequently treated with clozapine. A mirror-image design anchored to the start date of clozapine treatment and extending in either direction to a maximum of 1 year was used to extract data. Data extracted included incidents of self-mutilation (restraint), seclusion, the as and when needed (p.r.n.) use of medications, injuries to staff and peers, hospital privileges, and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores.; The subjects were all white women with a mean age of 37 years. All subjects carried DSM-III-R or DSM-IV borderline personality disorder diagnoses and an Axis I disorder diagnosis. They had received trials of several psychotropic agents, often in combination and mostly without benefit. After clozapine treatment, there were statistically significant reductions in incidents of self-mutilation (restraint), seclusion, the use of p.r.n. antianxiety medications, and injuries to staff and peers. These subjects received higher levels of hospital privileges, and their GAF scores nearly doubled following clozapine treatment. Four subjects were subsequently discharged from hospital.; These preliminary but nonetheless favorable results suggest that clozapine deserves careful consideration for a controlled study in patients with borderline personality disorder and psychoses, especially if the clinical issues include severe self-mutilation, aggression, and violence.

The goal of this study was to determine whether subjects diagnosed with bipolar disorder have an elevated rate of comorbid diabetes mellitus.; Three hundred forty-five hospitalized patients, aged 20-74 years, who met the DSM-III-R criteria for bipolar disorder, manic or mixed subtype, were evaluated for a comorbid diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. The frequency of diabetes mellitus in the study group was determined and compared with the expected frequency, calculated as a weighted average based on sex and age from national norms. Variables characterizing the course and severity of the affective disorder in the group of diabetic bipolar subjects and a group of nondiabetic age-matched bipolar subjects were compared.; The prevalence of diabetes mellitus among these bipolar patients was 9.9%, significantly greater than expected from national norms (3.4%). The patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus had significantly more lifetime psychiatric hospitalizations than the nondiabetic subjects, but age at first hospitalization and duration of psychiatric disorder were similar in the two groups.; The frequency of diabetes mellitus in hospitalized patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder is higher than in the general population. Manic-depressive patients with diabetes mellitus have a more severe course of illness, as indicated by a greater number of psychiatric hospitalizations. Possible reasons for this increased comorbidity include a genetic relationship between the disorders, a causal relationship in which hypercortisolemia induces diabetes or diabetic vascular lesions contribute to mania, an overlapping functional disturbance affecting similar regions of the brain, or the effect of psychotropic medications.",I,4

Treatment response was assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions scale.; Nine of the 10 patients in this series treated with olanzapine and an SSRI completed the 8-week augmentation trial. Of these, 4 demonstrated a complete remission or major improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms, 3 had partial remission, and 2 experienced no benefit. Nine patients experienced minimal adverse effects, primarily sedation, which did not interfere with continuing treatment. One patient discontinued olanzapine owing to excessive sedation.; The results of this preliminary, open-label trial suggest that olanzapine may be effective in augmenting ongoing SSRI treatment for a portion of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder refractory to SSRI treatment.

Olanzapine is significantly superior to haloperidol in positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of patients, and for tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal symptoms. Significantly greater improvement in avolition-apathy is achieved with olanzapine as compared to risperidone. These advantages are related to high affinity at the 5-HT2 binding site, no association with an alteration in dopamine A9 firing rates, and lower D2 striatal receptor blockade of olanzapine. Treatment with 10 mg/day olanzapine is more appropriate for positive symptoms, and 12.5-17.5 mg/day olanzapine is more effective for negative symptoms. Patients will need help adapting to a new level of functioning after a successful switch to olanzapine, and overcoming the disappointment that eventually occurs when the limitations of olanzapine become apparent.",5,E

Behavioral symptoms were assessed by the Behavior Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. Tolerability assessments included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, sedation levels, Functional Assessment Staging, Mini-Mental State Examination, and incidence of adverse events.; The mean dose at endpoint was 1.1 mg/d of risperidone and 1.2 mg/d of haloperidol. Although not significant, a higher percentage of patients receiving risperidone than those receiving placebo showed clinical improvement (> or =30% reduction from baseline to endpoint in BEHAVE-AD total score) at endpoint and week 12. Reductions in the BEHAVE-AD total score were significantly greater with risperidone than with placebo at week 12. In a further analysis of aggression, the most dominant symptom in these patients, BEHAVE-AD and CMAI aggression cluster scores were significantly reduced compared with placebo at endpoint and week 12. CGI scores were also significantly reduced at endpoint and week 12. Severity of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone did not differ significantly from that of placebo and was less than that of haloperidol. A post hoc analysis showed significantly greater reductions in the BEHAVE-AD aggressiveness score with risperidone than haloperidol at week 12.; Low-dose risperidone (mean 1.1 mg/d) was well tolerated and associated with reductions in the severity and frequency of behavioral symptoms, particularly aggression, in elderly patients with dementia.",I,I

A minimum baseline score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) of 45 was required for enrolment. Outcome evaluation measures included the BPRS, Global Assessment Scale (GAS), and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS).; Subjects (n = 16) has a mean age of 40 years and mean duration of illness of 16 years. Olanzapine treatment was initiated at 5 mg daily and was increased based on clinical judgement up to a maximum of 40 mg daily. Significant decreases in mean BPRS (P < 0.001) and GAS (P < 0.01) scores were observed at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16, compared with baseline. Eight of 16 patients responded to olanzapine, as defined by a 20% decrease in BPRS score by week 16. Dyskinetic movements significantly increased at week 4 (P < 0.01) but did not differ from baseline at weeks 8 and 16.; These results suggest that olanzapine at moderate to high doses may offer an effective treatment for a significant proportion of patients with schizophrenia nonresponsive to multiple trials of conventional antipsychotics. A randomized controlled trial is encouraged to validate these findings, and comparative trials are required to determine when clinicians should consider this approach.",I,6

Fluvoxamine, however, markedly inhibits the metabolism of clozapine, and hazardous side effects may result. This study prospectively investigated the safety and tolerability of an add-on therapy with fluvoxamine to a clozapine monotherapy in schizophrenic patients. Sixteen schizophrenic patients received 50 mg fluvoxamine as a comedication after having reached steady-state conditions under clozapine monotherapy. Patients were monitored for subjective adverse events, laboratory parameters, EEG and ECG recordings, orthostatic hypotension and their psychopathology. Concomitantly, serum concentrations of clozapine and metabolites were measured during monotherapy and after addition of fluvoxamine. In all patients, the serum concentrations of clozapine and metabolites were markedly increased (average: 2-3 fold, up to 5 fold for clozapine) after addition of fluvoxamine. Side effects remained almost unchanged in frequency and severity in spite of the pharmacokinetic interactions. ECG or laboratory parameters and orthostatic tests were similar under monotherapy and comedication. Minimal increases of EEG abnormalities were observed, but they were not associated with clinical impairment. Epileptic activities were always absent. The psychopathology improved which continued after start of the comedication. Though the addition of fluvoxamine to clozapine medication was well tolerated and critical side effects were absent, the combined treatment should be controlled by drug monitoring, as serum concentrations of clozapine increased to unpredictably high levels. Further studies have to find out if the combined treatment could be advantageous to clozapine monotherapy.",5,E

A randomized, double-blind comparison of placebo (N = 53) and olanzapine 10 mg (N = 53) for 3 to 5 days following the abrupt discontinuation of clozapine (< 300 mg/day) was carried out. Subjects were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression Scale of Severity, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Mini-Mental State Evaluation. Subsequently both groups received open-label olanzapine (10-25 mg/day) for an additional 9 weeks. Statistically significantly more placebo-treated (24.5%) than olanzapine-treated (7.5%) patients experienced clozapine discontinuation symptoms (p = 0.017). Core symptoms included delusions, hallucinations, hostility, and paranoid reaction and translated into a significantly higher worsening from baseline on the PANSS total, PANSS General Psychopathology subscale, and MADRS among subjects randomly assigned to receive placebo. After open-label treatment with olanzapine for 9 weeks, both groups were clinically stable, suggesting that the discontinuation symptoms were transient. However, subjects who had been randomly assigned to the 3- to 5-day placebo discontinuation segment achieved somewhat less global clinical improvement. Although a pharmacologic interpretation is speculative, evidence of a clozapine discontinuation syndrome was apparent. In most cases, the direct substitution of a pharmacologically similar agent (olanzapine) prevented the syndrome. Clozapine discontinuation or noncompliance should be considered in the differential assessment of an acutely emergent psychosis. The possibility that subjects who experience a clozapine discontinuation syndrome may take longer or are less likely to clinically restabilize warrants further investigation.",2,E

The core clinical features of autism include impairment in social interaction, impairments in verbal and nonverbal communication, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Autism often has coexisting neuropsychiatric disorders, including seizure disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, affective disorders, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette disorder. No etiology-based treatment modality has been developed to cure individuals with autism. However, comprehensive intervention, including parental counseling, behavior modification, special education in a highly structured environment, sensory integration training, speech therapy, social skill training, and medication, has demonstrated significant treatment effects in many individuals with autism. Findings from preliminary studies of major neurotransmitters and other neurochemical agents strongly suggest that neurochemical factors play a major role in autism. The findings also provide the rationale for psychopharmacotherapy in individuals with autism. This article reviews studies of neurochemical systems and related psychopharmacological research in autism and related neuropsychiatric disorders. Clinical indications for pharmacotherapy are described, and uses of various medications are suggested. This article also discusses new avenues of investigation that may lead to the development of more effective medication treatments in persons with autism.",5,E

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile.,Antipsychotic Agents; Benzodiazepines; Comorbidity; Continental Population Groups; Drug Interactions; Female; Humans; Male; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Pirenzepine; Time Factors,"Callaghan, J T; Bergstrom, R F; Ptak, L R; Beasley, C M","Multicentre trials in patients with schizophrenia confirm that olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic agent with broad efficacy, eliciting a response in both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Compared with traditional antipsychotic agents, olanzapine causes a lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms and minimal perturbation of prolactin levels. Generally, olanzapine is well tolerated. The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are linear and dose-proportional within the approved dosage range. Its mean half-life in healthy individuals was 33 hours, ranging from 21 to 54 hours. The mean apparent plasma clearance was 26 L/h, ranging from 12 to 47 L/h. Smokers and men have a higher clearance of olanzapine than women and nonsmokers. After administering [14C]olanzapine, approximately 60% of the radioactivity was excreted in urine and 30% in faeces. Olanzapine is predominantly bound to albumin (90%) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (77%). Olanzapine is metabolised to its 10- and 4'-N-glucuronides, 4'-N-desmethylolanzapine [cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2] and olanzapine N-oxide (flavin mono-oxygenase 3). Metabolism to 2-hydroxymethylolanzapine via CYP2D6 is a minor pathway. The 10-N-glucuronide is the most abundant metabolite, but formation of 4'-N-desmethylolanzapine is correlated with the clearance of olanzapine. Olanzapine does not inhibit CYP isozymes. No clinically significant metabolic interactions were found between olanzapine and diazepam, alcohol (ethanol), imipramine, R/S-warfarin, aminophylline, biperiden, lithium or fluoxetine. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, increases plasma concentrations of olanzapine; inducers of CYP1A2, including tobacco smoke and carbamazepine, decrease olanzapine concentrations. Orthostatic changes were observed when olanzapine and diazepam or alcohol were coadministered. Pharmacodynamic interactions occurred between olanzapine and alcohol, and olanzapine and imipramine, implying that patients should avoid operating hazardous equipment or driving an automobile while experiencing the short term effects of the combinations. Individual factors with the largest impact on olanzapine pharmacokinetics are gender and smoking status. The plasma clearance of olanzapine generally varies over a 4-fold range, but the variability in the clearance and concentration of olanzapine does not appear to be associated with the severity or duration of adverse effects or the degree of efficacy. Thus, dosage adjustments appear unnecessary for these individual factors. However, dosage modification should be considered for patients characterised by a combination of factors associated with decreased oxidative metabolism, for example, debilitated or elderly women who are nonsmokers.",5,E

The regional metabolic patterns were compared to each other and to the changes previously observed in men. In women, as in men, both clozapine- and fluphenazine-treatment were associated with lower metabolism in the superior prefrontal cortex and higher metabolism in the medial temporal lobe. In both men and women, clozapine treatment led to a greater lowering of inferior prefrontal cortex activity than fluphenazine, which was statistically significant in the larger male cohort. Fluphenazine led to higher metabolic rates in the lateral temporal lobe than clozapine did, but the differences between the two neuroleptics were not statistically significant in either group. The greatest differences in the female as compared to the male responses to fluphenazine and clozapine were in the cingulate and striatum. As compared to controls, the cingulate metabolic rates of women were reduced by 9.1% and 11.4% on clozapine and fluphenazine, respectively; whereas, men have a statistically nonsignificant reduction of 0.1% with clozapine and a 3.2% increase with fluphenazine. In men, fluphenazine was associated with a much greater elevation in basal ganglia metabolic rates than was clozapine, 23.5% as compared to 3.75%; whereas, in women, basal ganglia metabolic rates are nearly equally increased by fluphenazine (21.6%) and clozapine (15.1%).",2,E

Special interest was paid to the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, which might lessen the efficacy of psychotropic comedication. Lithium was superior to carbamazepine in bipolar I patients for various outcome criteria. Analyses in patients without psychotropic comedication indicate that the superiority of lithium is not the result of carbamazepine reducing plasma levels of concomitant drugs.",3,E

Family physicians will care for an increasing number of patients with Alzheimer disease as well as their caregivers and families.; A comprehensive and systematic review of the literature published between 1985 and 1998 about diagnosing and treating Alzheimer disease was conducted, using ""dementia,"" ""Alzheimer's disease,"" and ""treatment"" as search strategy key words. Data and information that reported significant conclusions were critically reviewed. Potentially important new data about new agents that might be of benefit when caring for patients with Alzheimer disease are discussed.; The primary goals when treating Alzheimer disease patients are enhancing autonomy and functional abilities and maintaining quality of life for patients and caregivers. In addition to diagnostic and pharmacologic treatment, primary care physicians will be called upon to provide nonpharmacologic support to assist with behavioral, social, and living environment problems faced by these patients and their families. The most common pharmacologic treatment is cholinesterase inhibition. Two cholinesterase inhibitors, tacrine and donepezil, are effective in treating cognitive and global function. Newer cholinesterase inhibitors should soon be available that might offer safety advantages as well as efficacy in treating behavioral and psychiatric symptoms related to Alzheimer disease. Other agents, including vitamin E, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogen, and Ginkgo biloba, are under investigation. Nonpharmacologic measures are important components in the management of Alzheimer disease.

Patients showing a predefined level of clinical response entered a 46-week maintenance phase.; After acute treatment, BPRS-based clinical improvements were seen in 38 and 27% of olanzapine and haloperidol patients, respectively (p = 0.002). Clinically important improvements on the Quality of Life Scale were achieved during acute treatment in 33% of olanzapine recipients and 25% of haloperidol recipients (p = 0.094). Olanzapine treatment in the acute phase led to significantly lower inpatient ($US5125 vs $US5795, p = 0.038) and outpatient ($US663 vs $US692, p = 0.001) costs, resulting in a significant overall reduction in mean total medical costs of $US388 (p = 0.033). This significant reduction in total costs was found despite olanzapine mean medication costs being significantly greater than haloperidol medication costs ($US326 vs $US15, p < 0.001).

The primary clinical measure was ""clinically important response"" (derived from BPRS total scores). The secondary measure was ""clinically important improvement"" (derived from CGI severity of illness scores). The primary economic measure was mean per diem, per patient total direct medical costs.; A total of 275 French patients where included in the study. Demographics and other baseline differences between olanzapine- and haloperidol-treated patients were not statistically significant. Olanzapine-treated patients (205 +/- 142 days) experienced significantly (p < 0.001) longer evaluation periods than haloperidol-treated patients (132 +/- 129 days). Olanzapine-treated patients (54%) were significantly (p = 0.03) more likely to experience a clinically important response than haloperidol-treated patients (40%). Olanzapine-treated patients (69%) were significantly (p = 0.02) more likely to experience clinically important improvement than haloperidol-treated patients (54%).

The findings indicate that olanzapine is dominant compared to haloperidol for the treatment of schizophrenia, in the context of analysed data. These findings produce increased relevance in France to the existing evidence supporting olanzapine's cost and effectiveness profiles.",2,E

To evaluate their relative effectiveness, and to better understand the advantages and limitations of each neuroleptic during actual clinical use, we compared one directly against the other.; Forty-two subjects with DSM-IV schizophrenia had received open-label treatment with either risperidone or olanzapine. Symptoms, global functioning, and extrapyramidal side effects before and after acute treatment were compared within and across groups. At 6-month follow-up, the relative effectiveness of these 2 atypical neuroleptics on symptoms and quality of life were further evaluated.; Following an average of 4 weeks of acute treatment, both risperidone and olanzapine were effective in reducing negative, psychotic, and disorganized symptoms. Although both neuroleptics were associated with low occurrence of treatment-emergent parkinsonism, risperidone was more likely to induce akathisia. The measures for parkinsonism were no different across treatment groups, even after taking into account the higher rate of anticholinergic use in the risperidone group. Following 6 months of treatment with these 2 atypical neuroleptics, there was a significantly greater reduction in psychotic symptoms among risperidone-treated subjects. Otherwise, risperidone and olanzapine appear to be equally effective in reducing disorganized and negative symptoms and in improving the quality of life.; Risperidone and olanzapine were equally effective as acute treatments. Risperidone was more effective for treatment of psychotic symptoms at 6 months, but otherwise the 2 medications were equally effective in the routine clinical care of patients with schizophrenia. If low (<6 mg/day) doses of risperidone are used, the 2 medications have comparable rates of parkinsonian side effects.",I,2

An overview of research and clinical experience.,"Anticonvulsants; Antidepressive Agents; Antimanic Agents; Bipolar Disorder; Cyclothymic Disorder; Drug Resistance; Drug Therapy, Combination; Electroconvulsive Therapy; Female; Humans; Hypothyroidism; Lithium; Male; Sex Factors","Kilzieh, N; Akiskal, H S","Although many studies of RCBD have been reported over the last 2 decades, knowledge remains limited. Higher incidence in women is the sole clearly replicated finding in most studies. This finding might be mediated by cyclothymia, a temperament that is of higher prevalence in women and that might be considered as a normal variant of RC. Many questions remain unanswered. Review of putative risk factors, such as hypothyroidism and treatment with antidepressants, provides no conclusive answers. There is clinical evidence to implicate both factors. In principle, the thyroid connection can be approached rationally, yet there seems to be no relationship between thyroid status and response to thyroid augmentation. For this reason and given the potential risks of long-term thyroid use, this strategy should not be the first one to be tried in RC. Cumulatively, naturalistic studies over the past 30 years have strongly implicated antidepressants in switching and cycle acceleration, yet the double-blind, controlled, prospective studies that are needed to provide definitive answers are unlikely to be conducted for ethical reasons discussed in this article. Bipolar family history of RC probands appears indistinguishable from non-RC probands, indicating that most likely RCBD does not breed true. Although RC seems to be more lithium resistant with less likelihood of being symptom-free after 2 to 5 years of follow-up, many of these patients nonetheless have resolution of the RC course. There is no marked difference in suicide rates. An association of RC with bipolar type II, D-M-I pattern and those who switch into mania or hypomania on antidepressants is a provocative possibility: Antidepressants might introduce RC by first inducing a switch during a depressive episode, creating a D-M-I pattern, a pattern that is poorly responsive to lithium, which eventually degenerates into RC. Again, this sequence might be mediated by the high prevalence of cyclothymia in bipolar II patients. Thus, data from phenomenology, family history, and long-term outcome do not support RC as a separate entity. RC appears to be a temporary complicated phase in the illness, not a stable feature. This was noted by Kraepelin: I think I am convinced that that kind of classification must of necessity wreck on the irregularity of the disease. The kind and duration of the attacks and the intervals by no means remain the same in the individual case but may frequently change, so that the case must be reckoned always to new forms. Data by Gottschalk et al testify to the chaotic mood swings of contemporary bipolar disorder. Moreover RC is seen in other medical diseases, such as epilepsy, in which patients have phases of increase in frequency of episodes (seizures) that become refractory to treatment. Further longitudinal prospective studies are required to understand the complexity of this intriguing phenomenon and to provide better treatments. Algorithms deriving from tertiary research or university-based clinical experience may not generalize to RC or otherwise treatment-resistant bipolar patients seen in more routine practice. Illness severity in RCBD generally precludes double-blind controlled investigations. Meanwhile, clinicians may rely on discontinuing antidepressants, maintaining patients on combined mood stabilizers--of which valproate is probably the most useful--and making judicious use of atypical neuroleptics. Benzodiazepines and alcohol (which produce withdrawal), caffeine, stimulants, exposure to bright light, and sleep deprivation during excited phases should be avoided. Thyroid and nimodipine augmentation can be considered in those with the most malignant course. These are patients who need the maximal support that their psychiatrist can provide them. Office visits must be arranged as the last appointment of the day.",5,E

Atypical antipsychotics have been shown to enhance frontal dopaminergic activity in animal models. We predicted that substitution of risperidone for typical antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia would be associated with enhanced functional activation of frontal cortex. We measured cerebral blood oxygenation changes during periodic performance of a verbal working memory task, using functional MRI, on two occasions (baseline and 6 weeks later) in two cohorts of schizophrenic patients. One cohort (n = 10) was treated with typical antipsychotic drugs throughout the study. Risperidone was substituted for typical antipsychotics after baseline assessment in the second cohort (n = 10). A matched group of healthy volunteers (n = 10) was also studied on a single occasion. A network comprising bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal and lateral premotor cortex, the supplementary motor area, and posterior parietal cortex was activated by working memory task performance in both the patients and comparison subjects. A two-way analysis of covariance was used to estimate the effect of substituting risperidone for typical antipsychotics on power of functional response in the patient group. Substitution of risperidone increased functional activation in right prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, and posterior parietal cortex at both voxel and regional levels of analysis. This study provides direct evidence for significantly enhanced frontal function in schizophrenic patients after substitution of risperidone for typical antipsychotic drugs, and it indicates the potential value of functional MRI as a tool for longitudinal assessment of psychopharmacological effects on cerebral physiology.",2,E

NE-100, a selective sigma1-receptor antagonist, shows improvement of abnormal behaviors and cognitive dysfunction induced by phencyclidine (PCP). However, NE-100 does not inhibit dopamine agonist-induced behaviors nor induces catalepsy. The mode of action of NE-100 is estimated to be the indirect modulation of the NMDA/PCP-receptor ion channel complex and the modulation of dopamine release from the dopaminergic nerve terminals. The recently reported MS-355/MS-377, which is also a selective sigma1-receptor antagonist, has a similar pharmacological profiles as NE-100, but in addition, MS-355/MS-377 inhibits methamphetamine-induced formation of reversal tolerance and also inhibits apomorphine-induced climbing behavior like dopamine D2-receptor antagonists. The report on clinical trial targeting schizophrenia shows results on rimcazole, remoxipride, BMY 14802, panamesine (EMD 57445) and SL 82.0715. Rimcazole was effective in the open study, but the double blind trial was discontinued due to seizure induction. Remoxipride showed efficacy different from those of dopamine D2-receptor antagonists (less extrapyramidal adverse effects), but the trial was discontinued due to occurrence of aplastic anemia.

We hypothesized that the 5-HT3 receptor subtype may play a role in the light of the moderate-to-high affinity to this receptor of some of the atypical antipsychotic agents which have a low propensity to cause akathisia, as well as our earlier findings with the 5-HT2/5-HT3 antagonist mianserin. In an open-label pilot study, we administered the selective 5-HT3 antagonist granisetron (fixed dose, 2 mg/day) for 4 days to 10 neuroleptic-treated patients with acute NIA. Three patients discontinued granisetron because of a lack of response. The remainder showed no significant change in score on the Barnes Akathisia Scale during the trial. NIA symptoms remained unchanged or worsened in five patients (71.4%) and improved to a certain degree in only two. It seems that the 5-HT3 subtype of serotonergic receptor is not involved in the development of NIA, and 5-HT3 antagonists are ineffective in the serotonin-related pharmacotherapy of NIA.",3,E

Quantitative evaluation of this GFJ-drug interaction is required for the proper clinical management of patients. Methods Using felodipine as a model drug, we constructed a pharmacokinetic model based on irreversible inhibition of intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) by GFJ. We fitted previously published data [5, 6] for felodipine ER (extended release formulation) to the ratio of CLGI,int before and after grapefruit juice ingestion by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis to estimate the reaction rate constant between GFJ and CYP3A4 (K) and the elimination rate constant of CYP3A4 (k ).; The model gave a turnover rate of CYP3A4 of 0.0849 h-1, corresponding to a half-life of 8.16 h, in agreement with reported values. The AUC-time profiles of felodipine ER in the case of different amounts and schedules of GFJ ingestion were simulated using the parameter values estimated from the model.; The modelling leads to the important conclusion that GFJ-felodipine interaction increases with increasing frequency and amount of GFJ ingestion, and that an interval of 2-3 days between GFJ intake and felodipine administration is necessary if GFJ-felodipine interaction is to be avoided.",2,E

This study recorded ERPs from 30 electrode sites while subjects were engaged in a continuous word recognition memory task. Results are reported for 24 patients having a diagnosis of schizophrenia (n = 16) or schizoaffective disorder (n = 8) and 19 age-matched healthy controls.

However, accuracy of word recognition memory was poorer in patients than controls, and patients showed markedly smaller N2 amplitude. Reduced amplitudes of N2 and N2-P3 were associated with poorer performance, with highest correlations over the left inferior parietal (N2) and left medial parietal (N2-P3) region. Moreover, patients failed to show significantly greater left than right hemisphere amplitude of N2-P3 at posterior sites, which was seen for healthy controls.

The present study applied the recurring digit span memory test and the recurring block span memory test (assumed to be an indicator of right-temporohippocampal functioning) to 106 acute schizophrenic patients (DSM-III-R), 49 siblings of these patients without DSM-III-R lifetime diagnoses as well as 53 non-related control subjects without DSM-III-R lifetime diagnoses. Results of our investigation indicate that schizophrenic patients differ from control subjects regarding recurring digit span in a reduced number of correct reproductions of recurring trials. Since performance of schizophrenic patients was only non-significantly different from control subjects regarding recurring block span memory, our findings point to a task-specific memory impairment in schizophrenia and argue against a generalized deficit in this disease. Furthermore, individuals at risk for schizophrenia also differed from control subjects concerning the recurring digit span memory test but not with regard to the recurring block span test. Therefore we conclude that the reduced cumulative learning curve of verbal material (reduced number of correct reproduction of recurring digit trials) in schizophrenic patients and their healthy siblings might represent a marker for the liability to schizophrenia and parallels neuroimaging findings concerning left-sided temporohippocampal abnormalities in this disease, which presumably play a key role in the etiology of schizophrenia.",2,E

Three-quarters of the cohort were prescribed antipsychotic drugs, one-half received benzodiazepines and nearly one-third received antidepressants. The trends in drug use from 1994 to 1997 show that for patients with schizophrenia there has been a decrease in the prescription of typical neuroleptics: the use of haloperidol passed from 56% to 42.4% and that of chlorpromazine dropped from 13.5% to 6.1%; during the same period, an increasing use of the atypical compound risperidone was observed. Among patients suffering from unipolar affective psychosis, the prescriptions of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have not changed in time, while the proportion of patients receiving neuroleptic drugs has increased from 41% to 45.2%. In addition, the use of antiepileptic drugs and lithium increased, irrespective of diagnosis. Almost 40% of the patients on psychotropic drugs received three or more drugs. Finally, a positive association was found between the number of prescribed compounds and the daily dose administered.; These data indicate that in the absence of a rational approach to drug use, a symptomatic approach is generally adopted, by which common sense, experience, information provided by non-independent agencies and other cultural parameters play an important role in the prescription strategy. Pharmacoepidemiology should more often consider the use of drugs as a dependent variable, to be investigated within the context of other clinical, cultural, social and setting-related parameters; this approach would enable a more comprehensive assessment of prescribing practices and strategies in routine clinical care.",2,E

A 1-4-week single drug treatment phase (risperidone 1-3 mg bid or mirtazapine 30 mg nocte) was followed by a 2-4-week combined drug treatment phase at unchanged doses. Twelve patients were enrolled, nine of whom were treated with risperidone in the single drug phase. Results of plasma level measurements are available for six patients and indicate that adding mirtazapine to risperidone does not alter steady-state plasma concentrations of risperidone and its 9-hydroxy metabolite. Data from one patient suggest that adding risperidone to mirtazapine does not result in clinically relevant changes in plasma concentrations of either compound. The combination was well tolerated and no major or relevant adverse events were observed. Adding risperidone to mirtazapine probably does not necessitate a change of the dosage of either drug, but more extensive investigations are needed.",4,E

There is evidence that schizophrenia patients exhibit impairments in this so-called prepulse inhibition. Our study investigated whether prepulse inhibition is affected by neuroleptic drug treatment as is suggested by animal research.; Prepulse inhibition was tested in five unmedicated and 20 medicated inpatients with schizophrenia, and 12 normal controls.; The unmedicated schizophrenia patients showed a strong impairment of sensorimotor gating as indexed by the absence of prepulse inhibition. By contrast, the medicated patients showed a pronounced prepulse inhibition that did not differ from that of the normal controls. There was a substantial covariation between the rated severity of the positive syndrome and the amount of prepulse inhibition--i.e., the patients whose positive symptoms were rated as more severe showed less prepulse inhibition.; These data suggest that the impaired sensorimotor gating of schizophrenia patients is not a stable vulnerability indicator, but may rather be related to the positive syndrome and may be improved by treatments with neuroleptic medication.",3,E

A double-blind trial compared clozapine and haloperidol in patients with schizophrenia who were refractory to conventional antipsychotic medication and were hospitalized for 30 to 364 days at 15 Veteran Affairs medical centers during the year before study entry. Patients in the original study were randomly assigned to haloperidol or clozapine and followed for 12 months, at maximum tolerable doses. Patients who completed a full year of treatment with clozapine (n = 122), or with either haloperidol or another conventional antipsychotic medication (n = 123) and who also completed the 9- or 12-month assessment were included. Response to treatment was defined as 20 percent improvement on standard scales of symptoms and quality of life at the latter of the 9- or 12-month interviews. More patients assigned to clozapine achieved 20 percent improvement in symptoms at each followup. Among patients who did not improve at 6 weeks, 3 months, or 6 months, there were no significant differences between clozapine and comparison patients in outcomes at 1 year. Among patients who did improve, maintenance of that improvement also did not differ between the groups at 1 year on symptom measures. Maintenance of improvement in quality of life at 1 year was significantly greater for clozapine patients who had improved at 6 months (p < 0.04). Significant differential symptom response to clozapine occurred exclusively during the first 6 weeks of treatment.",4,E

At endpoint, 63 percent of risperidone-treated patients and 56 percent of haloperidol-treated patients were clinically improved (> or = 50% reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores). Risperidone was better tolerated than haloperidol: the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was significantly lower in the risperidone-treated patients; significantly fewer risperidone-treated patients required antiparkinsonian medication; and significantly fewer discontinued treatment because of adverse events. A post hoc analysis revealed that low doses of these antipsychotics were efficacious in some patients. Furthermore, the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms and the use of antiparkinsonian medications were significantly lower in patients receiving low doses (maximum, < or = 6 mg/day) than high doses (maximum, > 6 mg/day) of risperidone or haloperidol. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that patients with a first psychotic episode may require low doses of antipsychotic medications. Studies designed specifically to compare low and high doses of antipsychotics are warranted to help optimize treatment for these patients.",I,I

Atypical antipsychotic agents were developed in response to problems with typical agents, including lack of efficacy in some patients, lack of improvement in negative symptoms, and troublesome adverse effects, especially extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSs) and tardive dyskinesia CTD). Atypical antipsychotics differ from typical psychotics in their ""limbic-specific"" dopamine type 2 (D2)-receptor binding and high ratio of serotonin type 2 (5-HT2)-receptor binding to D2 binding. In clinical trials in patients with non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia, risperidone and olanzapine were superior to placebo for positive and negative symptoms. Risperidone and olanzapine were superior to haloperidol on some measures. Quetiapine was better than placebo but was not better than typical antipsychotics. Head-to-head comparisons of atypical antipsychotics in non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia have been inconclusive. Clozapine remains the standard agent for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Atypical agents are substantially more expensive than their typical antipsychotic counterparts. To fully determine the overall efficiency of these drugs, other potential benefits, such as improved quality of life, need to be factored in. Atypical antipsychotics are associated with a decreased capacity to cause EPSs, TD, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. Clozapine carries a risk of agranulocytosis; the white blood cell count must be monitored. Atypical antipsychotics are increasingly being used for indications other than schizophrenia, such as the management of aggression, mania, and depression. Atypical antipsychotics are often considered first-line agents for treating schizophrenia and are promising treatment alternatives for other psychiatric and neurologic conditions.",I,5

In most of the patients, the combined treatment was safe and well tolerated. Adverse reactions occurred in 16.6% of the patients and included prolonged ECT-induced seizures (one case), supraventricular (one case) and sinus tachycardia, and blood pressure elevation. It seems that combined ECT-clozapine treatment is effective and safe. This strategy may be a therapeutic option in treatment-resistant patients.",5,E

We assessed striatal DA D2 receptor occupancy by olanzapine and risperidone in 36 young patients [31 males, 5 females; mean age 21.1 years (16-28)] with first episode schizophrenia, using [123I]iodobenzamide (IBZM) SPECT. The occupancy of DA D2 receptors was not significantly different between olanzapine and risperidone. However, in subgroups of most prescribed doses, DA D2 occupancy was higher in the risperidone 4-mg group (79%) compared to the olanzapine 15-mg group (62%). [123I]IBZM binding ratios decreased with olanzapine dose (r = -0.551; P < 0.01), indicating higher DA D2 receptor occupancy with higher olanzapine dose. Akathisia and positive symptoms were correlated with [123I]IBZM binding ratio (r = -0.442; P < 0.01; and r = -0.360; P < 0.05, respectively). Prolactin (PRL) levels were elevated in the risperidone, but not in the olanzapine group, at comparable D2 receptor occupancy levels. In the olanzapine group, PRL levels were correlated with [123I]IBZM binding ratio (r = -0.551; P < 0.01). In conclusion, both olanzapine and risperidone induce a high striatal D2 receptor occupancy, dependent on dose and group formation. The lower incidence of prolactin elevation with olanzapine, compared to risperidone, may not be attributed to a lower D2 receptor occupancy.",I,6

The patients undertook two sessions of the CPT (undegraded and 25% degraded) twice, one at the end of the washout period and the other at the end of the study. Thirty-eight patients completed the study, 19 in each group. Both groups experienced significant improvements in clinical symptoms, and the risperidone group showed no change in the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms. Despite those improvements, the CPT performance indexes did not change significantly from the beginning to the end of the study.

However, over the last ten years, different reports have clearly demonstrated that agranulocytosis and neutropenia can be easily prevented by means of strict hematologic surveillance. This article reviews the results of the first five years of the Italian Clozapine Monitoring System (ICLOS).; The hematologic parameters of 2,404 patients registered between 1995 and 1999 were collected in a central database, before the patients began clozapine-treatment, weekly for the first 18 weeks, and then monthly throughout the duration of therapy. On the basis of conventional criteria, different risk levels have been identified with total leukocyte <3. 0x10(9)/L and/or an absolute neutrophil count <1.5x10(9)/L leading to immediate discontinuation of the drug.; The analysis shows that 0.9% of the patients developed neutropenia and 0.7% agranulocytosis, mainly during the first 18 weeks of clozapine treatment. Drug discontinuation led to the normalization of hematologic parameters in all cases, and the use of growth factors reduced the risk of infectious complications. Transient leukocytosis and eosinophilia were also observed but these did not have any serious clinical effects.; The ICLOS study confirms that regular hematologic monitoring is highly effective in minimizing the incidence of clozapine-associated blood dyscrasias. The lower than initially expected rates of agranulocytosis and associated deaths are encouraging in view of the benefits of this drug in treatment-resistant schizophrenia and other neurologic disorders.",I,I

In addition, 10 mg of olanzapine suppressed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increased REM sleep latency.; Olanzapine (5 mg and 10 mg) produced substantial (59.1% and 83.3%) and highly significant dose-related increases in SWS in humans probably via blockade of brain 5-HT(2C) receptors. 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonism may account for some of the therapeutic and adverse effects of olanzapine therapy.",5,E

Based on the oestrogen hypothesis, which postulates a synergistic relationship between oestrogen and neuroleptics, it was hypothesized that oestrogen would exacerbate extrapyramidal symptoms.; Twenty-five psychotic women were assessed using the ESRS and blood hormone analysis. Testing was conducted twice, 2 weeks apart, in a randomized cross-over design.; Contrary to expectation the results indicated that high levels of oestrogen reduce hyperkinetic symptoms in women with psychosis, and this effect appears to be further potentiated when both oestrogen and progesterone are high.; On the basis of these findings, and receptor studies in animals, it was concluded that oestrogen has different effects on dopamine dynamics in the mesolimbic and mesostriatal pathways.",3,E

This study was carried out to examine (i) the serum concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), IL-1R antagonist (IL-1RA) and Clara Cell protein (CC16), an endogenous anticytokine, in nonresponders to treatment with typical neuroleptics and (ii) the effects of atypical antipsychotics on the above IRS variables. The above parameters were determined in 17 patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) to treatment with neuroleptics and in seven normal volunteers and 14 schizophrenic patients who had a good response to treatment with antipsychotic agents. Patients with TRS had repeated measurements of the IRS variables before and 2 and 4 months after treatment with atypical antipsychotics. Serum IL-6 was significantly higher in schizophrenic patients, irrespective of their response to typical antipsychotics, than in normal controls. Serum IL-1RA was significantly higher in the TRS patients than in controls, whereas responders took up an intermediate position. The serum concentrations of CC16 were significantly lower after treatment with atypical antipsychotics during 4 months than before treatment. It is concluded that (i) schizophrenia and, in particular, TRS is characterized by an activation of the monocytic arm of cell-mediated immunity and (ii) atypical antipsychotics may decrease the anti-inflammatory capacity of the serum in TRS patients.",2,E

The aim of this study was to examine the profile and the specificity of the executive impairment and its association with memory performance in young patients with unipolar depression. We compared patients with depression to normal control subjects and schizophrenics. Twenty young inpatients with unipolar depression, 14 schizophrenics and 20 age-, education- and IQ-matched control subjects were assessed with a neuropsychological battery including: (1) verbal memory task; (2) frontal tasks (WCST, Cognitive Estimate, Verbal fluency, verbal and visuo-spatial span) and a new complex sorting test (Delis test). Depressed patients and schizophrenics exhibited executive deficits. Unlike schizophrenics, depressed patients did not show memory impairment. Deficits in several 'higher-level' functions combined to produce executive impairments in patients with depression including complex integration for concept formation, spontaneous cognitive flexibility and initiation ability. Impaired functions in schizophrenia and in depressed patients were similar but were differently related to clinical variables. The pattern of memory failure in our schizophrenics is believed to reflect retrieval and encoding deficits. Our findings highlight the heterogeneity of skills grouped under the term 'executive functions' that are vulnerable in depression or schizophrenia.",2,E

Standard measures of clinical and motor syndromes were administered, as well as a comprehensive battery of tests to assess (1) motor skills, (2) attention span, (3) verbal fluency and reasoning, (4) nonverbal fluency and construction, (5) executive skills, and (6) immediate recall at baseline and after 6, 30, and 54 weeks of treatment.; The general cognitive index derived from the 6 domain scores revealed a significantly greater benefit from treatment with olanzapine relative to haloperidol and olanzapine relative to risperidone, but no significant difference was shown between risperidone and haloperidol. The improvement related to olanzapine was apparent after 6 weeks and enhanced after 30 and 54 weeks of treatment. Exploratory within-group analyses of the 6 cognitive domains after a conservative Bonferroni adjustment revealed a significant improvement with olanzapine only on the immediate recall domain, and similar analyses of the 17 individual tests revealed a significant improvement with olanzapine only on the Hooper Visual Organization Test.; These data suggest that olanzapine has some superior cognitive benefits relative to haloperidol and risperidone.

Treatment assignment was stratified by whether patients were taking typical or atypical antipsychotic medications. Negative symptom status was monitored monthly for one year by raters blind to group assignment and measured as a composite of five symptoms using the Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms.; When the analysis controlled for baseline negative symptoms, participants in the multiple-family group experienced significantly reduced negative symptoms compared with those receiving standard care. Taking atypical antipsychotic medication or having a diagnosis of substance abuse was not associated with the severity of negative symptoms. An additional analysis of the five individual negative symptoms indicated small but consistent group differences on all dimensions except inattention. Negative symptoms were significantly correlated with relapse to acute illness but not with outpatient or inpatient service use.; The study demonstrated that a psychoeducational multiple-family group intervention was more effective than standard care in managing negative symptoms over a 12-month period.

The degree of receptor occupancy predicted clinical improvement, hyperprolactinemia, and extrapyramidal side effects. The likelihood of clinical response, hyperprolactinemia, and extrapyramidal side effects increased significantly as D(2) occupancy exceeded 65%, 72%, and 78%, respectively.; The study confirms that D(2) occupancy is an important mediator of response and side effects in antipsychotic treatment. The data are consistent with a ""target and trigger"" hypothesis of antipsychotic action, i.e., that the D(2) receptor specificity of antipsychotics permits them to target discrete neurons and that their antagonist properties trigger within those neurons intracellular changes that ultimately beget antipsychotic response. While limited to haloperidol, the relationship between D(2) occupancy and side effects in this study helps explain many of the observed clinical differences between typical and atypical antipsychotics.",6,E

The goal of this investigation is to further characterize PPI and habituation deficits in schizophrenia, and to examine whether differing subgroups of schizophrenics would show comparable PPI deficits.; PPI was measured in 24 male schizophrenic subjects (9 acutely decompensated inpatients and 15 stable outpatients) and in 20 age-matched normal control subjects. Schizophrenic subjects were rated for positive and negative symptoms at the time of testing.; Schizophrenic subjects showed deficits in prepulse inhibition and habituation as compared to normal subjects. Similar latency facilitation was produced by the prepulse in both groups. Acutely decompensated inpatients and stable outpatients did not differ in percent PPI. PPI did not correlate with severity of positive or negative symptoms.; These results suggest that schizophrenic subjects have impaired central inhibitory mechanisms as measured by PPI, and support the hypothesis that periods of relative clinical remission are not accompanied by normalization of sensorimotor gating.",2,E

This was accompanied by a correction in erythrocyte membranes of abnormalities in both n-3 and n-6 highly unsaturated fatty acids and with reduced neuronal membrane phospholipid turnover, as evidenced by serial 31-phosphorus cerebral magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Using recently developed techniques of image segmentation, subvoxel registration and quantitation, analysis of serial high-resolution 3D cerebral MRI scans showed that, in the year before EPA treatment, cerebral atrophy was taking place and that this atrophy was reversed by six months of EPA treatment. These results demonstrate that EPA can reverse both the phospholipid abnormalities previously described in schizophrenia and cerebral atrophy. They provide strong further evidence in support of the membrane phospholipid model of schizophrenia.",5,E
10756621,"The newer, 'atypical' antipsychotic drugs--their development and current therapeutic use.","Antipsychotic Agents; Humans; Schizophrenia; Technology, Pharmaceutical","Kendrick, T","General practitioners (GPs) need to become more aware of a new generation of antipsychotic drugs that are 'atypical' in that, unlike traditional neuroleptics, they do not cause extrapyramidal side-effects; they may also be more effective against both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia by their actions on various neurotransmitter pathways in the brain. This is a non-systematic review of the development of these new drugs and outlines how they are currently being used. It includes information found from an electronic search of the databases MEDLINE (from 1966 to June 1998) and EMBASE (from 1980 to January 1998) using the combined search terms 'antipsychotic agents', 'atypical', and 'schizophrenia'.",5,E

Trials comparing the atypical antipsychotic clozapine with other antipsychotic drugs were identified in extensive electronic searches. Two independent reviewers extracted data on methodology and primary outcomes, and assessed trial quality by use of three sets of criteria (Cochrane, Delphi, and Jadad). There was no association between trial quality, as measured by any of the criteria sets, and primary measures of outcome. Trials with the best score for randomisation and concealment according to the Delphi scale had a significantly lower relative risk for relapse in clozapine-treated groups, and studies with well reported random order generation according to Jadad criteria tended to have better odds ratios for clinical improvement on clozapine. These findings strengthen the evidence of true clozapine superiority in these aspects. No other quality items correlated to the primary outcomes. Inadequate randomisation techniques may be a source of bias in clozapine studies, but much more research is needed on the connections between trial quality and trial outcome.",2,E

Several genetic mutations in neurotransmitter receptors targeted by antipsychotic drugs have been found to be related to clinical response. Modern molecular genetic techniques will facilitate the identification of those mutations that determine treatment response. Future psychiatric prescription will include the genetic characterization of neurotransmitter receptors for the selection of the most beneficial drug according to the individual's pharmacogenetic profile.,I,5

Presumably, patients in the placebo-controlled studies are more stable, but there are no data available to support such an assumption. The authors tested the hypothesis in a set of randomized trials of neuroleptics in treating schizophrenia by comparing placebo-controlled (PCTs) and comparator-controlled trials (CCTs) in terms of basic patient characteristics. The results, based on a total of 296 studies, showed that the patients in PCTs, compared with those in CCTs, were older (p < 0.002), had a longer duration of illness (p < 0.001), and a lower initial symptom severity (p < 0.02). No difference was found in the number of subjects per treatment arm or in the proportion of female subjects. However, investigation of studies which used same-gender study subjects revealed that female-only populations were more likely to be tested in PCTs (p < 0.03) than in CCTs. To investigate current trends in psychopharmacologic research, the authors tested separately a subset of trials of new atypical antipsychotics. The results indicated a significantly smaller number of females participating in the latest PCTs (p < 0.0003). Moreover, our findings suggest that the characteristics of patients in the current controlled trials are rather uniform; thus, the generalizability of new study findings for certain groups of patients with schizophrenia (e.g., with early or late onset or brief duration of illness) may be compromised.",5,E

In each trimester social support (SSQ), coping strategies (CISS) and pregnancy progress were assessed. Approximately 4-5 weeks following delivery, information on labor, delivery and infant status was collected and the DACL and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were administered. The final sample consisted of 80 women.; Approximately 16% of the women in this sample experienced depressed mood in the postpartum and 25% of the sample reported depressed mood only during pregnancy. Women depressed only during pregnancy and those depressed in the postpartum reported more emotional coping and higher trait and state anxiety during gestation. More hassles during pregnancy was related to prepartum depressed mood, but not postpartum depressed mood. Consistent with the literature, the best predictor of postpartum depressed mood was depressed mood during pregnancy.; The sample size was relatively small and we relied solely on self-reported depressive symptomology.; The findings point to specific psychosocial variables which can be targeted early in pregnancy to reduce the rate of depressed mood in the prepartum and postpartum periods.",5,E

A mirror-image study was conducted. Cases admitted in the first semester of the year (when most of patients were treated with standard neuroleptics) were compared to cases admitted in the second semester of the year, when atypical antipsychotic agents were routinely utilized as first line treatment of patients with psychotic signs. Cases admitted in the first semester received a significantly higher daily dosage of antipsychotic drugs and more frequently received anticholinergics. In the second semester, a significantly higher number of patients received anticonvulsants, in particular valproate and gabapentin. There was no significant difference between the two groups of cases in the number of patients treated with antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, lithium, and carbamazepine and in the mean daily dose of benzodiazepines, lithium, carbamazepine, or valproate on the first day of hospitalization, the day of evaluation, and on discharge. On discharge, similar percentages of patients went home, were transferred to other Psychiatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) or to private clinics, or left our PICU against medical advice. The length of hospitalization was similar in the two groups. There was no significant difference in the rate of aggressive or violent behavior registered in the two groups of cases. The risk of increasing violence rates, lengthening hospitalization, and facilitating patients' non-compliance should not be major concerns for physicians prescribing second-generation antipsychotics in the emergency care setting. Since these drugs have been shown to have at least similar efficacy (or greater efficacy in the case of clozapine) in the treatment of psychotic disorders as typical neuroleptics and to have a better side-effects profile, they should become first line treatment for patients with psychotic signs admitted to emergency care psychiatric facilities.",4,E

A randomized, open, parallel, multicenter design was used. One hundred eighty-four subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive either RP or a CN, and 165 of them completed the follow-up. Outcome measures were taken at 3, 6, and 12 months and included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. Within this 12-month follow-up, RP was found to be superior to CNs in terms of both the average change in score from baseline on the PANSS (p = 0.006) and the proportion of good responders (as defined by a 20% decrease in total PANSS scores;p = 0.03). For positive symptoms, the effectiveness of the RP treatment tended to increase over time. At 12 months, the percentage of good responders in the RP group was twice as large as that in the CN group (30% vs. 15%;p = 0.03). The superiority of RP over CNs was constant over the three dose categories. In both the RP and the CN groups, the maximum decrease in psychopathology was achieved with the lowest dose range. A worsening of akathisia was less frequent in subjects receiving RP than in those receiving CNs (p = 0.02). In conclusion, this study showed that, compared with CNs, RP is beneficial in the treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia and that some of these benefits may appear only after longer-term treatment.",I,I

Risperidone, a 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine D2 antagonist, is an atypical antipsychotic and was a candidate medication for the treatment of cocaine dependence. One hundred ninety-three cocaine-dependent subjects were enrolled in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects initially received either placebo or 4 or 8 mg of risperidone, with a subsequent change to active doses of 2 mg and 4 mg. Subjects attended the clinic twice each week, provided urine samples, obtained medication, and underwent one behavioral therapy session per week. The study was terminated at the interim analysis. Retention was worse for the 4- and 8-mg active medication groups. Side effects were primarily associated with the 8-mg dose, although neither 2 mg nor 4 mg was well accepted by subjects. There was no reduction in cocaine use associated with risperidone. The results suggest that although antagonists might be a useful treatment approach, such as in the treatment of opiate dependence, risperidone is unlikely to find broad acceptance with the treatment-seeking population.",4,E

The authors present a review of sudden deaths that occurred at Sha'ar Menashe Mental Health Center between January 1991 and August 1997. The number of cases of deceased inpatients was retrieved from the hospital's computerized database and divided into three groups: sudden death, suicide, and disease-related death. Copies of mandatory reports of sudden death filed with the Ministry of Health were obtained, and the corresponding patient records were reviewed. The rates of sudden death, suicide, and disease-related deaths were calculated for clozapine-treated patients (CTPs) during and after treatment and for patients treated with other psychiatric agents (non-CTPs). Among 561 CTPs, there were 4 sudden deaths during treatment, 2 sudden deaths after treatment, 2 suicides during treatment, and 2 disease-related deaths during treatment. Among 4918 non-CTPs, there were 14 sudden deaths, 5 suicides, and 86 disease-related deaths, all of which occurred during treatment with other psychiatric agents. CTPs who experienced sudden death were 10.37 years younger and healthier than non-CTPs who experienced sudden death. The sudden death rate was 3.8 times higher for CTPs than for non-CTPs, whereas the rate of disease-related death was 5 times higher for non-CTPs than for CTPs. Contrary to expectations, the rate of suicide among patients currently receiving clozapine in this sample was 3.6 times higher than among non-CTPs. Because CTPs who experienced sudden death were also younger and healthier, it seems that treatment with clozapine may present a greater risk for sudden death than treatment with other psychiatric medications. The limited number of sudden death cases and deaths from other causes should be noted so that these findings are considered with caution.",I,I

Dosage regimens were flexible (amisulpride 200-800 mg/day, haloperidol 5-20 mg/day). Improvement in mean Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score was significantly greater for amisulpride than haloperidol (17.0 versus 12.8, P = 0.01). Positive symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] positive) improved in a similar way in each group but amisulpride caused a significantly better improvement in negative symptoms (PANSS negative) (7.1 versus 3.7, P < 0.0001).

As such, relatively little has been published regarding its in vivo effects at the dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2a (5-HT2a) receptor systems. The following study was undertaken to explore these effects across the clinical dose range and relate this information to its clinical profile.; Twelve patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to doses of 150 to 600 mg/d (n=3, at 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg/d) of quetiapine. After 3 weeks of treatment, D2 and 5-HT2a occupancy were measured using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, 12 to 14 hours after the last dose. Clinical efficacy and adverse effect ratings were obtained at baseline, at the time of PET scanning, and at 12 weeks. Two additional patients were included to examine the effects of the drug 2 to 3 hours after last dose.; Quetiapine was an effective antipsychotic and improved the extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin level elevation noted at baseline. It achieved these results with minimal (0%-27%) D2 occupancy 12 hours after the last dose. Study of the additional subjects revealed that quetiapine does give rise to transiently high (58%-64%) D2 occupancy 2 to 3 hours after a single dose that then decreases to minimal levels in 12 hours.; Quetiapine shows a transiently high D2 occupancy, which decreases to very low levels by the end of the dosing interval. Quetiapine's low D2 occupancy can explain its freedom from extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin level elevation. The data suggest that transient D2 occupancy may be sufficient for its antipsychotic effect. Future studies controlling for nonpharmacological effects as well as activities on other receptors will be necessary to confirm this suggestion.",6,E

Supplementary complex statistical analyses substantiate that the increased efficacy of the atypical neuroleptics in treating negative symptoms can only partially be explained by indirect effects of better extrapyramidal tolerability, better effects on productive psychotic symptoms, etc. Instead, it is due largely to the stronger direct effect of these atypical neuroleptics. Clinical studies to evaluate their efficacy in chronic schizophrenic patients with stable, predominantly negative symptoms are still mostly lacking.

Improvement was assessed by the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale.; All patients showed significant improvement 24 months from intake (p < .001). Such an improvement was significantly greater among patients with schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder than in patients with schizophrenia (p < .05). The presence of suicidal ideation at intake predicted greater improvement at endpoint.; Clozapine appears to be effective and relatively well tolerated in acute and long-term treatment of patients with psychotic bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder who have not responded to conventional pharmacotherapies.",I,2

Treatment assignment was based on purely clinical criteria, as the study did not include any experimental intervention. Safety was evaluated through the collection of spontaneous adverse events and a specific questionnaire for extrapyramidal symptoms. Global clinical status was measured through the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scales.; From the 2967 patients included, 2128 patients were treated with olanzapine as monotherapy or combined with other drugs (olanzapine group), and 821 were treated with other antipsychotic drugs as monotherapy or combined with other drugs (control group). There were no statistical differences between treatment groups at baseline regarding age, gender, disease duration, or severity of symptoms. Olanzapine was well tolerated and effective in this study. Overall incidence of adverse events was significantly lower in the olanzapine group compared with the control group (p < .001). Somnolence and weight gain were significantly more frequent in the olanzapine group, and akathisia, dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, and tremor were significantly higher in the control group. Clinical improvement at endpoint, measured through the mean change in the CGI-S and the GAF, was significantly higher in the olanzapine group compared with the control group (p = .004).; These results show that olanzapine is safe and effective in nonselected schizophrenic outpatients and are consistent with the efficacy and safety profile that olanzapine has shown in previous controlled clinical trials.",I,I

Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the relationship of baseline characteristics and measures of clinical change to continuation for the entire sample and for patients assigned to each medication.; Patients assigned to clozapine continued taking the study drug for a mean of 35.5 weeks as compared with only 27.2 among patients assigned to haloperidol (F = 4.45, df = 1,422; p = .0001). No differences were found between the groups in the proportion of prescribed pills that were returned at any timepoint. Among patients assigned to haloperidol, poorer continuation was associated with being older and greater continuation with receiving public support. Among patients on clozapine treatment, continuation was poorer among African American patients and greater among patients who showed reduced clinical symptoms and akathisia. Continuation with clozapine was greater even after adjusting for these factors.; Continuation with medication is greater with clozapine than haloperidol and is partly explained by greater symptom improvement and reduced side effects.

Olanzapine, a new antipsychotic drug, shares many pharmacological and clinical properties with clozapine. However, in patients treated with olanzapine, no case of seizure induction has been reported so far, and the EEG has not been studied systematically. We examined the EEGs of patients with schizophrenia treated with either olanzapine (N = 9) or clozapine (N = 9) prior to medication and 3 to 7 weeks afterwards. Clozapine induced significant EEG slowing present in 78% of the patients, and definite epileptiform activity appeared in 33%. Olanzapine also induced significant EEG slowing, but less frequently (in 44% of the patients) and less pronounced than clozapine. Olanzapine had no significant effect an epileptiform activity, but in one patient, an isolated sharp/slow-wave complex was observed. These preliminary data suggest that olanzapine induces EEG slowing to a lower extent than clozapine. Olanzapine's possible effect an the seizure threshold deserves further attention.",2,E

Patients' clinical symptom profile, subjective responses and attitudes toward drugs, prevalence of dysphoria, akathisia, abnormal involuntary movements and Parkinsonian symptoms, and quality of life were ascertained using standardized rating scales. Between-group differences were examined with analysis of variance and chi-square tests. Patients receiving novel antipsychotic drugs experienced fewer side-effects, reported positive subjective responses and favourable attitudes toward their treatment, and revealed a lower prevalence of neuroleptic dysphoria. The differences were statistically significant (p<0.05) with the risperidone, olanzepine and quetiapine groups. Self-rated quality of life, measured with the sickness impact profile, was also significantly better among patients receiving novel antipsychotic drugs. These perceived benefits, however, were not reflected in the clinician rated (objective) measures of psychosocial functioning and quality of life. These findings substantiate the general notion that novel antipsychotic medications are uniformly better tolerated as indicated by the measures of subjective responses, side-effects and self rated quality of life.",I,5

A simple one-step solvent extraction with 15% methylene chloride in pentane was used to isolate the compounds from plasma. The compounds were eluted from a phenyl-hexyl column and detected with a Perkin-Elmer SCIEX API2000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer using positive ion atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization and multiple reaction monitoring. The assay was linear over the range 0.1-100 ng ml(-1) when 0.5 ml of plasma was used in the extraction. The overall intra- (within-day) and inter- (between days) assay variations were < 11%. The variations in the concentrations of two long-term quality control samples from pooled patient plasma samples analyzed over a period of 6 months were approximately 10%. The analysis time for each sample was 4 min and more than 100 samples could be analyzed in one day by running the system overnight. The assay is simple, highly sensitive, selective, precise and fast. This method is being used for the therapeutic drug monitoring of schizophrenic patients treated with RSP and to study the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of RSP and 9-OH-RSP in rats.",6,E

To date, no clinical studies have evaluated the effect of quetiapine in patients who only partially respond to conventional antipsychotics, yet this type of patient is most frequently seen by psychiatrists. Therefore, this international, multicentre, double-blind study was conducted to compare the efficacy and tolerability of 8 weeks' treatment of quetiapine 600 mg/day with haloperidol 20 mg/day in 288 patients who had a history of partial response to conventional antipsychotics and displayed a partial or no response to 1 month of fluphenazine (20 mg/day) treatment. Patients on quetiapine tended to have greater improvement than those on haloperidol in the primary efficacy measure, mean Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) score, after 4 weeks' treatment (-9.05, -5.82, respectively, P = 0.061) and at study end (-11.50, -8.87, respectively, P = 0.234). Similarly, there was a trend towards patients on quetiapine demonstrating greater improvements in the secondary efficacy measures (Clinical Global Impression, PANSS subscale and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores) [week 4 (baseline) to week 12 (end)], but the difference between treatments did not reach significance. Significantly more patients on quetiapine than on haloperidol showed a clinical response-patient response rates, defined as > 20% reduction in PANSS total score between weeks 4 and 12, were 52.2% for quetiapine and 38.0% for haloperidol (P = 0.043). Patients receiving quetiapine required less anticholinergic medication (P < 0.011), had greater reduction in extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) (P = 0.005) and fewer treatment-emergent EPS-related adverse events compared to those on haloperidol (P < 0.001). Serum prolactin concentrations were elevated at the end of fluphenazine treatment in 73% of patients. Between weeks 4 and 12, elevated serum prolactin concentrations significantly decreased in quetiapine-treated patients compared to those receiving haloperidol (P < 0.001). At the end of quetiapine treatment, 83% of patients had normal prolactin levels while only 21% of patients receiving haloperidol were within the normal range. These results suggest that quetiapine may make a valuable contribution to the management of patients with a history of partial response to conventional antipsychotics.",I,I

One strategy in treating these refractory patients is to augment clozapine with other somatic treatments. This article reviews the efficacy and safety of the combination of clozapine with other somatic treatments. A total of 70 articles were obtained from a manual, as well as computerized (Medline), search of the English language literature from 1978 to March 1998. Few controlled studies exist; most were case reports/series. From these data, the greatest risk of adverse effects seems to be associated with clozapine combined with benzodiazepines, valproate, or lithium, but no currently evaluated combination is absolutely unsafe. In terms of efficacy, the data suggest a number of potential augmentation strategies, although controlled data are few. Combination therapies with clozapine are common in clinical practice, despite a lack of empirical data, and the benefits and risks of these combinations need to be systematically reviewed.",I,5

Among 151 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and co-occurring substance use disorder who were studied in a dual-disorder treatment program, 36 received clozapine during the study for standard clinical indications. All participants were assessed prospectively at baseline and every 6 months over 3 years for psychiatric symptoms and substance use. Alcohol-abusing patients taking clozapine experienced significant reductions in severity of alcohol abuse and days of alcohol use while on clozapine. For example, they averaged 54.1 drinking days during 6-month intervals while off clozapine and 12.5 drinking days while on clozapine. They also improved more than patients who did not receive clozapine. At the end of the study, 79.0 percent of the patients on clozapine were in remission from alcohol use disorder for 6 months or longer, while only 33.7 percent of those not taking clozapine were remitted. Findings related to other drugs in relation to clozapine were also positive but less clear because of the small number of patients with drug use disorders. This study was limited by the naturalistic design and the lack of prospective, standardized measures of clozapine use. The use of clozapine by patients with co-occurring substance disorders deserves further study in randomized clinical trials.",I,2

A retrospective chart review was conducted to identify ECG abnormalities and cardiovascular side effects.; The prevalence of ECG abnormalities in patients who had been using antipsychotics other than clozapine was 13.6% at baseline, which increased significantly to 31.1% after commencement of clozapine treatment. Among the 53 patients without baseline ECG abnormalities, 13 showed new-onset ECG abnormalities after using clozapine. Normal ECG under previous antipsychotic medication reduced the risk of new-onset ECG abnormalities, whereas increased age was found to increase the risk. The occurrence of orthostatic hypotension or tachycardia was not related to the development of ECG abnormalities. Most of the newly developed abnormalities had little clinical significance, and they tended to occur during the initial phase of treatment. In 10 patients, ECGs normalized despite the continued use of clozapine. Clozapine increased corrected QT interval (QTc) in a dose-dependent fashion; however, the clinical significance of this observation is uncertain. Pathologic prolongation of QTc was found to be rare.; Although a substantial portion of patients treated with clozapine developed ECG abnormalities, most of the abnormalities were benign and did not hinder further treatment.",I,6

Several psychoactive medications have shown efficacy for selected symptoms of autistic disorder and can be used to augment critical educational and behavioral interventions that are the mainstays of treatment. A comprehensive review of medication trials conducted in individuals with autistic disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders is presented. The typical antipsychotic haloperidol is the best-studied medication in autistic disorder but is associated with a high rate of dyskinesias. Investigations to date suggest that the atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone have efficacy for certain symptoms of autistic disorder and may be better tolerated than typical antipsychotics. Preliminary results from trials with serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are favorable, although efficacy has not been demonstrated in younger age groups. Recent controlled studies of nalfrexone suggest that the drug has minimal efficacy. In two small controlled investigations, clonidine was more effective than placebo for a variety of symptoms, including hyperactivity and irritability; in one of these studies, however, the majority of patients relapsed within several months. Psychostimulants reduced hyperactivity and irritability in one small double-blind crossover study in children with autistic disorder, although these agents are frequently reported to exacerbate irritability, insomnia, and aggression in clinical populations. Recent controlled trials of secretin have not shown efficacy compared to placebo. Several other medications, including buspirone, mood stabilizers, and beta-blockers, have produced symptom reduction in some open-label studies and may warrant controlled investigation.",5,E

An estimate of [123I]epidepride 'specific binding' to D2/D3 receptors was obtained in patients and age-matched healthy volunteers. A summary measure was generated representing striatal and temporal cortical relative %D2/D3 receptor occupancy by antipsychotic drugs. Occupancy data were compared with previously studied groups of patients receiving typical antipsychotic drugs (n=12) and clozapine (n=10).; Mean striatal and temporal cortical %D2/D3 receptor occupancy in olanzapine-treated patients was 41.3% (SD 17.9) and 82.8% (SD 4.2), respectively. Unexpectedly low levels of striatal relative %D2/D3 receptor occupancy were seen in two patients with typical antipsychotic-drug-induced movement disorder prior to switching to olanzapine. In the temporal cortex, mean D2/D3 dopamine receptor occupancy levels above 80% were seen for all antipsychotic drugs studied.; The atypical antipsychotic drugs olanzapine and sertindole, in common with clozapine, demonstrate higher occupancy of temporal cortical than striatal D2/D3 dopamine receptors in vivo at clinically useful doses. This could help mediate their atypical clinical profile of therapeutic efficacy with few extrapyramidal side effects. Limbic selective blockade of D2/D3 dopamine receptors could be a common action of atypical antipsychotic drugs.",2,E

Behavioral ratings, including the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, were obtained at baseline and throughout the trial. Placebo-treated patients subsequently received an identical open-label trial of risperidone addition.; For study completers, 9 (50%) of 18 risperidone-treated patients were responders (mean daily dose, 2.2 +/-0.7 mg/d) compared with 0 of 15 in the placebo addition group (P<. 005). Seven (50%) of 14 patients who received open-label risperidone addition responded. Risperidone addition was superior to placebo in reducing OCD (P<.001), depressive (P<.001), and anxiety (P =.003) symptoms. There was no difference in response between OCD patients with and without comorbid diagnoses of chronic tic disorder or schizotypal personalty disorder. Other than mild, transient sedation, risperidone was well tolerated.; These results suggest that OCD patients with and without comorbid chronic tic disorders or schizotypal personality disorder may respond to the addition of low-dose risperidone to ongoing SRI therapy.",4,E

This retrospective study examined the relative efficacy of these drugs in chronically institutionalized patients refractory to conventional antipsychotic agents.; A total of 24 patients who at different time periods had received adequate trials of both clozapine and risperidone and met our inclusion criteria for minimum dose and duration of each trial were included; for clozapine, a minimum dose of 300 mg/day had to be maintained for at least 12 weeks, and for risperidone, a minimum dose of 6 mg/day for at least 6 weeks. Information obtained from systematic retrospective chart review was blindly rated by 2 psychiatrists using the 7-point Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale on overall clinical state and along specific symptom domains of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and aggressive behavior.; The mean +/- SD dose was 520+/-94 mg/day for clozapine and 7.5+/-2.2 mg/day for risperidone. Fourteen patients (58%) were classified as responders to clozapine, while 6 (25%) responded to risperidone (CGI-I score of 1 or 2); on specific symptom domains, response rates to clozapine were 38% (9/24) on positive symptoms, 29% (7/24) on negative symptoms, and 71% (12/17) on aggressive behavior. For risperidone, response rates were 17% (4/24) on positive symptoms, 8% (2/24) on negative symptoms, and 41% (7/17) on aggressive behavior.; The results of this study support the utility of first giving a risperidone trial in a treatment algorithm for refractory patients because of its better risk/benefit profile compared with clozapine. Clozapine, however, remains our gold standard in the management of these patients.",2,E

Furthermore, these studies have demonstrated tolerability and a favourable side-effect profile. In contrast to classical antipsychotics, sertindole was not associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). We report drug surveillance data in 34 comorbid and comedicated sertindole treated patients suffering from different psychotic disorders. The drug surveillance consisted of two distinct phases: inpatient treatment and outpatient follow-up. Clinical global impression (severity and improvement of illness), psychotic symptoms, side-effects, and blood parameters have been carefully documented. With special respect to cardiac safety electrocardiograms (ECGs) have been recorded twice (during sertindole treatment and during treatment with an antipsychotic different from sertindole). Recommended ECG-parameters for assessment of the proarrhythmic risk of a drug have been calculated (QTc-, QTc2-interval; QT-, QTc-dispersion). The majority of patients (n = 29) have been treated previously with several typical and/or atypical antipsychotics. We observed a clinical response to sertindole treatment in 29 patients (85%). Both positive and negative symptoms improved with sertindole and no severe side-effects have been documented. EPS occurred at placebo level. A mean QTc-interval prolongation of 19.7 ms (4.7%) has been detected. None of the patients developed clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of cardiac dysrhythmia during sertindole treatment, or other clinical evidence of cardiac abnormalities. In summary, sertindole did show efficacy for positive and negative symptoms together with a favourable side-effect profile. No evidence for an increased proarrhythmic risk has been found.",3,E

The atypical antipsychotic quetiapine ('Seroquel') provides equivalent efficacy to the typical antipsychotics chlorpromazine and haloperidol in the short-term treatment of schizophrenia. Moreover, the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms associated with quetiapine treatment is equivalent to that observed with placebo treatment, which may lead to increased patient compliance with quetiapine compared with typical antipsychotics. 2. This report presents the results from two small studies aimed at determining the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine in nonpsychotic subjects with renal or hepatic impairment. Equal numbers of impaired subjects and healthy control subjects were administered a single, 25 mg dose of quetiapine, and plasma concentrations were determined up to 48 hr after dosing. 3. No clinically significant differences were found when the pharmacokinetic parameters for subjects with renal or hepatic impairment were compared with those for healthy control subjects. The results indicate that dosage adjustment of quetiapine may be unnecessary in psychotic patients with decreased renal function. 4. In subjects with hepatic impairment related to alcoholic cirrhosis, the results suggest that no change is needed in the recommended quetiapine starting dose (25 mg). However, because of a noted inter-subject variability in the clearance of quetiapine in the cirrhotic group, it is recommended that dose escalation be performed with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 5. The single dose of quetiapine 25 mg generally was well tolerated in nonpsychotic subjects in good health or with either renal or hepatic impairments. Quetiapine also had no effect on the endogenous creatinine clearance of renally impaired or healthy control subjects.",6,E

The Committee on Safety of Medicines and Medicines Control Agency 'yellow card' post-marketing surveillance data were analysed for reports of haemopoietic disorders with the 16 antipsychotics in common use. Corrections for relative risk were made in three separate ways: (i) control for degree of use, using Northern Ireland prescribing data for 1995; (ii) percentage of total reports from 1963 to 1996; and (iii) examination of the first 5 years' post-marketing data only. After clozapine and remoxipride the highest risks of haemopoietic reactions appeared to be associated with the aliphatic phenothiazine derivatives thioridazine and chlorpromazine. There is therefore no evidence of any increased risk with high-potency drugs such as haloperidol or pimozide or with the newer drugs such as sulpiride or risperidone. Continued vigilance, however, is necessary as more new atypicals become available and begin to be widely prescribed.",I,I

Its incidence in the western world is estimated at 4-7 cases/10,000/year. A method of shortening hospitalization and improving level of functioning is the use of unique medication, including clozapine, which has been in use in Israel for the past 6 years. We report 327 patients who participated in a community rehabilitation program and were treated with clozapine. They were compared with 417 patients who corresponded to the guidelines of the Director of Mental Health Services for treatment with clozapine, but were not treated with it for reasons not defined in the guidelines. The study included those 25-44 and 45-64 years of age and according to the division of the population of patients hospitalized in both government and private hospitals. The project demonstrates the savings from use of clozapine as opposed to the alternative of hospitalizing these patients. It also shows the complexity and difficulty in assimilating new technologies, in relation to the influence of social considerations and supplier/insurer accounting on the patterns of technological assimilation.",5,E

Four hundred and twenty-three inpatients with schizophrenia participating in a clinical trial comparing clozapine and haloperidol (VA Cooperative Study in Health Services #17) were evaluated using multiple measures of health-related quality of life (Lehman Quality of Life Interview; Heinrichs-Carpenter-Hanlon Quality of Life Scale; Strauss-Carpenter Level of Function scale, and clinical response.) The Quality of Life Interview showed less sensitivity to change and treatment effect, as well as lower correlations with all other measures than the Quality of Life Scale and the Level of Function scale. The latter scales showed high sensitivity to both change and treatment effect, and moderate-high correlations with other measures and with each other. The Quality of Life Scale and the Level of Function scale rater assessments appeared to be substantially more sensitive to subtle change and treatment effects than the patient-reported Quality of Life Interview for clinical trials.

Although clozapine is known to be an effective antipsychotic agent that does not significantly exacerbate parkinsonism, its use requires frequent blood count assessment. Olanzapine is another novel antipsychotic that is not associated with blood dyscrasia, and if equally effective could become the preferred drug for treating hallucinations in subjects with PD.; A randomized, double-blind, parallel comparison of olanzapine and clozapine in patients with PD with chronic hallucinations was conducted. The primary outcome measure was the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) for psychotic symptoms. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor subscale was used as a secondary outcome measure and as a safety monitoring tool.; After 15 patients had completed the study, safety stopping rules were invoked because of exacerbated parkinsonism in olanzapine-treated subjects. UPDRS motor impairment scores from baseline to study end significantly increased with olanzapine treatment, and change scores between the olanzapine and clozapine groups significantly differed. The primary clinical domains responsible for the motor decline were gait and bradykinesia. Even with a smaller patient number than originally anticipated, clozapine significantly improved hallucinations and overall behavioral assessment, whereas olanzapine had no effect.; At the doses studied, olanzapine aggravates parkinsonism in comparison with clozapine and should not be regularly used in the management of hallucinations in patients with PD.",I,4

The therapeutic effect of i.v. and i.m. biperiden was studied in an open clinical trial in twenty-three (12 male and 11 female) patients who developed antipsychotic-induced acute akathisia as defined by the research criteria of the DSM-IV. Following the development of akathisia, 5 mg of biperiden was intravenously injected in seventeen patients and intramuscularly in six patients. The therapeutic effect of biperiden on akathisia was clinically assessed by using the rating scale of Barnes.; Following i.v. administration on biperiden, the mean time to onset and maximum effect occurred 1.6 (SD = 1.9) and 9.2 minutes (SD = 6.0), respectively. Furthermore, at the time of maximal effect, akathisia was completely ameliorated in all patients. The side effects reported were mild and transient. Following i.m. administration, the mean time to onset and maximum effect were 30.5 (SD = 5.9) and 50 minutes (SD = 7.4), respectively.

We interviewed study participants every 4 months for 2 years to assess psychiatric symptoms and functional status, and we collected continuous measures of prescribed medications, service utilization, and other costs. We used both parametric and nonparametric techniques to examine changes in cost and parametric analyses to examine changes in effectiveness. We used bootstrap techniques to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and create cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.; Both groups incurred similar costs during the 2-year study period, with a trend for clozapine to be less costly than usual care in the second study year. Clozapine was more effective than usual care on many but not all measures. With the use of effectiveness measures that favored clozapine (extrapyramidal side effects, disruptiveness), bootstrap techniques indicated that, even when a payer is unwilling to incur any additional cost for gains in effectiveness, the probability that clozapine is more cost-effective than usual care is at least 0.80. These findings were not as evident when outcomes where clozapine was not clearly superior (psychotic symptoms, weight gain) were examined.; Clozapine demonstrated cost-effectiveness on some but not all measures of effectiveness when the alternative was a range of conventional antipsychotic medications.",6,E

Information about agents with established antimanic properties is increasing, and more agents with putative antimanic properties are being identified. We first review the controlled studies supporting the efficacy of the established antimanic agents lithium, valproate, and carbamazepine and standard antipsychotics. We then review available research on two important classes of drugs that are emerging as potential treatments for acute mania: the novel antipsychotics, which include clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone, and the new antiepileptics, which include gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, topiramate, and zonisamide. We conclude that although controlled data are accumulating to support the efficacy of several atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of acute bipolar mania, particularly olanzapine, ziprasidone, and risperidone, the novel antiepileptics need more extensive study before it can be concluded that any of them possess specific antimanic properties.

We review literature pertaining to key questions related to use of pharmacotherapy in the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder. The few double-blind trials with a reasonable sample size are restricted to bipolar I patients and address a modest range of questions mostly related to use of lithium. One rigorous multicenter trial found valproate to have prophylactic benefit. Other studies with valproate alone and in combination suggest efficacy equivalent to lithium and perhaps greater than carbamazepine. Data available for combination treatment are sparse but moderately encouraging. Maintenance treatment with standard antidepressant medications appears destabilizing for some bipolar patients, particularly following a mixed episode. Although some bipolar patients may benefit from combined treatment with a mood stabilizer and a standard antidepressant medication, current knowledge does not allow confident selection of the bipolar patients who might benefit. Clozapine and perhaps other atypical antipsychotics are promising options for maintenance treatment but have not been evaluated in double-blind trials. The numerous other agents used in maintenance treatment are primarily adjuncts to lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine, and information about them is largely anecdotal and uncontrolled. Study design for maintenance trials remains an imperfect art. Conclusions must be drawn cautiously, given the limited generalizability of study designs that accession samples enriched with presumed treatment responders, randomize patients after brief periods of partial remission, abruptly taper prior treatment, make no attempt to distinguish relapse from recurrence, use no formal outcome assessments, or report hospitalization as the only outcome criterion.",5,E

Nonresponsiveness needs to be approached as a multidimensional syndrome by specifying which symptoms in the spectrum of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, excitement/hostility, cognitive symptoms, and anxiety/depression are failing to respond to treatment. This review presents some of the clinical, demographic and biological correlates of nonresponse, in addition to compliance issues, psychosocial factors or side effects and as-yet-untreated comorbidities as a source for nonresponse. The effects of the atypicals clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine as compared to typicals are reviewed using available double-blind studies in this treatment refractory group of schizophrenia patients. The limited number of reports on the comparison of atypical compounds amongst each other are critically presented. Given that a subset of patients still do not respond to these agents, clinicians are using various augmentation strategies. We review studies with augmentation strategies which remain difficult to interpret given the open label and uncontrolled nature of most of these studies.",5,E

Among family members, clozapine was associated with significantly (p = .048) greater reduction in feelings of dissatisfaction related to providing support to the patient, but not in objective measures of support, amount of worry the patient engendered, or days of missed employment or household activity. Although clozapine reduces symptoms, thus lowering family burden, it also increases days living in the community, which tends to increase family burden, perhaps canceling out the benefit to families of reduced symptoms.; Clozapine has a small but significant effect on the experience of families of patients. This is the first study to demonstrate that effective pharmacotherapy may be of some benefit to families as well as to patients.",2,E

The primary efficacy measure was change in the total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from baseline to end point. Secondary efficacy measures were the total score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); the PANSS positive, negative, general psychopathology, and mood subscores; and the Clinical Global Impression improvement score. Also recorded were spontaneously reported adverse events; extrapyramidal symptoms (assessed by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, Simpson-Angus Scale, and Barnes Akathisia Scale); vital signs; and clinical laboratory test results.; Forty-eight patients were treated with olanzapine; of these, 45 were assessable over the full 18-week study period. Total scores on the PANSS and BPRS were reduced from baseline by an average of 17.7 (14.2%) and 9.8 points (20.2%), respectively. Eighteen patients (40.0%) experienced a treatment response, defined as a reduction in PANSS total score of > or = 20%. A total of 25 patients (55.6%) achieved a similar reduction in BPRS total score. Significant reductions were seen in both the positive and negative symptom scores on the PANSS (P < 0.001). Olanzapine was well tolerated, with minimal treatment-emergent adverse events or clinically relevant changes in vital signs or clinical laboratory test results. No clinically significant blood dyscrasias were observed in olanzapine-treated patients, including those who had discontinued clozapine because of treatment-associated leukopenia or neutropenia.; The results of this study suggest that olanzapine may be of benefit in patients who are refractory to or unable to tolerate clozapine.",I,6

Previous studies of quetiapine use in elderly patients with schizophrenia and other psychoses examined short-term administration (< or = 12 weeks). Given the growing elderly population, the commensurate increase in elderly patients with psychoses, and the expected increase in disease treatment-years, the effect of long-term quetiapine administration in older patients is of considerable interest.; This study assesses the long-term tolerability, safety, and clinical benefit of quetiapine in elderly patients with psychosis.; Elderly patients (> or = 65 years of age) with psychotic disorders, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, participated in this 52-week, open-label, multicenter trial. Investigators increased (and later adjusted) daily doses of quetiapine on the basis of clinical response and tolerability, and assessed safety and efficacy. Efficacy assessments were made using the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), Simpson-Angus Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). For patients who withdrew before week 52, analyses were performed using observed data and the last observation carried forward.; One hundred eighty-four patients with psychotic disorders (98 women and 86 men) with a mean age of 76.1 years entered the trial. Seventy-two percent had psychotic disorders due to general medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, and 28% had other psychotic disorders, most commonly schizophrenia. Overall, 89 (48%) patients completed treatment through 52 weeks. Median total daily dose was 137.5 mg. Reasons, for withdrawal included lack of efficacy (19%), adverse events or intercurrent illness (15%), failure to return for follow-up (13%), protocol noncompliance (3%), and diminished need for treatment (2%). Somnolence (31%), dizziness (17%), and postural hypotension (15%) were common adverse events, but they rarely resulted in withdrawal from therapy. EPS-related adverse events occurred in 13% of patients. At end point (week 52), mean total score on the Simpson-Angus Scale had decreased from baseline by 1.8 points, whereas changes in AIMS scores were negligible. No clinically important effects were reported relative to mean changes in hematologic, thyroid function, or hepatic function variables. Quetiapine treatment appeared to have no associated cardiovascular adverse outcomes despite cardiovascular comorbidities and unrestricted use of concomitant cardiovascular medications. Significant decreases in BPRS total score (n = 170, P < 0.001) and CGI Severity of Illness item score (n = 177, P < 0.002) were seen at end point (observed data and last observation carried forward). Decreases of > or = 20% in mean BPRS total score were observed in 83 (49%) patients.; These results provide preliminary information to clinicians regarding tolerability, safety, and clinical improvement with quetiapine in elderly patients with psychotic symptoms, and support controlled studies of quetiapine in this patient population.",I,I

Magnitude of response, dose dependency, time course, effects of sex and age, and response to switching from haloperidol to olanzapine are assessed.; The effects of olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol on PRL were assessed in patients with schizophrenia or related psychoses participating in 3 double-blind clinical trials: (1) a 6-week acute trial comparing olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 1,336) and haloperidol 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 660), with a 1-year, open-label olanzapine extension for responders; (2) a 54-week study comparing olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 21), risperidone 4 to 10 mg/d (n = 21), and haloperidol 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 23) in early illness; and (3) a 28-week study comparing olanzapine 10 to 20 mg/d (n = 172) and risperidone 4 to 12 mg/d (n = 167).; PRL elevations were significantly greater with risperidone than with either olanzapine or haloperidol in study 2. and significantly greater than with olanzapine in study 3 (all, P < 0.001). PRL elevations were significantly greater with haloperidol than with olanzapine in study 1 (P < 0.001 ). A dose-response relationship was not consistently confirmed with any of the drug treatments. Risperidone-associated PRL elevations peaked relatively early in treatment. In haloperidol- and risperidone-treated patients, the mean change in PRL was greater in women than in men. PRL decreased significantly when treatment was switched from haloperidol to olanzapine.; This side-by-side analysis of 3 independent studies suggests that with the 3 antipsychotic drugs studied, PRL is elevated moderately by olanzapine (mean change, 1-4 ng/mL), intermediately by haloperidol (mean change, approximately 17 ng/mL), and strongly by risperidone (mean change, 45-80 ng/mL). No consistent dose-response relationship was observed, and the time course and sex-dependency of the response differed between the 3 agents. Patients with haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia may benefit from a switch to olanzapine. Long-term studies examining the health consequences of chronic hyperprolactinemia during antipsychotic treatment are needed.",5,E

The authors compared the outcomes of two group psychotherapy programs for smoking cessation in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were also treated with the nicotine transdermal patch and with either atypical or typical antipsychotic medications.; Forty-five subjects were randomly assigned to 1) the group therapy program of the American Lung Association (N=17) or 2) a specialized group therapy program for smokers with schizophrenia (N=28) that emphasized motivational enhancement, relapse prevention, social skills training, and psychoeducation. All subjects participated in 10 weeks of treatment with the nicotine transdermal patch (21 mg/day) and 10 weekly group therapy sessions and continued to receive their prestudy atypical (N=18) or typical (N=27) antipsychotic medications. Outcome variables included treatment retention, rate of smoking abstinence, and expired-breath carbon monoxide level.; Smoking abstinence rates did not differ in the two group therapy programs. However, atypical antipsychotic agents, in combination with the nicotine transdermal patch, significantly enhanced the rate of smoking cessation (55.6% in the atypical agent group versus 22.2% in the typical group), which was reflected by a significant effect of atypical versus typical agents on carbon monoxide levels. Risperidone and olanzapine were associated with the highest quit rates.; The results suggest that 1) smoking cessation rates with the nicotine transdermal patch are modest in schizophrenia, 2) specialized group therapy for schizophrenic patients is not significantly different from American Lung Association group therapy in its effect on smoking cessation, and 3) atypical agents may be superior to typical agents in combination with the nicotine transdermal patch for smoking cessation in schizophrenia.",2,E

We compared risk of current and recent use of antipsychotic drugs with non-use before the index date in cases and controls.; Current exposure to conventional antipsychotic drugs was associated with a significantly increased risk of idiopathic venous thromboembolism compared with non-use (adjusted odds ratio 7.1 [95% CI 2.3-21.97]). Although we found no difference between phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, or other conventional antipsychotic drugs, low potency antipsychotic drugs drugs such as chlorpromazine and thioridazine were more strongly associated with venous thromboembolism (odds ratio 24.1 [3.3-172.7]) than were high potency antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol (3.3 [0.8-13.2]).

In order to investigate the efficacy of the two drugs in clearly defined subsamples, a series of subgroup analyses was carried out. First, patients with a bipolar I disorder (n = 114) were analyzed separately. In these patients, lithium was superior to carbamazepine. In contrast, carbamazepine was at least equally as efficacious as lithium in the subsample of patients with bipolar II disorder or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified (n = 57). In a second analysis on differential efficacy, the whole sample was subdivided into a classical subgroup (bipolar I patients without mood-incongruent delusions and without comorbidity; n = 67) and a nonclassical subgroup including all other patients (n = 104). Classical bipolar patients had a significantly lower hospitalization rate under lithium than under carbamazepine prophylaxis (26 vs. 62%, p = 0.012). For the nonclassical group, a tendency in favor of carbamazepine was found. In a third step, we analyzed the impact of episode sequence on differential efficacy. In a global view, the episode sequence prior to the index episode was not correlated to differential efficacy. Our results might, however, indicate that patients with an episode sequence of mania-depression-free interval responded better to lithium. Besides differential efficacy, suicidal behavior and patients' satisfaction with treatment were investigated. Regarding suicidal behavior, a trend in favor of lithium was found. The data on patients' satisfaction were significantly in favor of carbamazepine. In conclusion, lithium appears to be superior to carbamazepine in classical bipolar cases and might have additional impact on proneness to suicide. The distinctly larger group of patients with nonclassical features might profit more from carbamazepine which seems to be well accepted by the patients. Hence, treatment alternatives to lithium are desirable for the majority of bipolar patients.",3,E
11093363,An assessment of iloperidone for the treatment of schizophrenia.,Animals; Antipsychotic Agents; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Isoxazoles; Piperidines; Schizophrenia,"Jain, K K","Iloperidone (Novartis' Zomariltrade mark) is an atypical antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia. Current trends in the treatment of schizophrenia indicate that some atypical antipsychotics are being recommended as first-line therapy. Atypical antipsychotics, in addition to being dopamine (D) receptor antagonists, are all relatively potent serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonists and are less likely than conventional dopamine antagonists to induce movement disorders. However, all of these agents differ in their receptor profiles and clinical profiles. Iloperidone, a benzisoxazole, is a mixed 5-HT(2A)/D(2)antagonist. Iloperidone was found to be more potent than its analogues when compared with haloperidol in antagonising climbing behaviour in mice. Iloperidone is extensively metabolised and the main circulating metabolite is reduced iloperidone. In patients treated with iloperidone, a low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms and weight gain has been shown. Data from Phase II trials demonstrated efficacy in patients at doses of 8 mg/day and tolerability was good up to 32 mg/day. Phase III prospective, double-blind, randomised trials with iloperidone are in progress under the ZEUS (Zomariltrade mark Efficacy Utility and Safety) programme involving 3300 patients. Iloperidone, with a balance of activity at the dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors, has obvious advantages over clozapine and olanzapine, both of which have a similar receptor profile as they favour serotonergic over dopamine receptors. Iloperidone is likely to reach the market in 2001 and has favourable prospects in the atypical antipsychotic market for schizophrenia, which is expanding from US$ 1.5 billion in 2000 to US$ 3 billion in 2005.",5,E

Although some previous studies have suggested that patients with schizophrenia may have altered ""normal"" values, only limited data were available. It is now believed that biological values do not usually follow a normal distribution; therefore, reference ranges are frequently used when interpreting laboratory tests in clinical practice and in research. However, it may be important to use disease-specific hematologic reference ranges when evaluating laboratory test results for patients with schizophrenia. In this study, data taken from patients with schizophrenia prior to treatment in previous phase II and phase III pharmaceutical studies were analyzed to produce reference ranges for a variety of hematologic parameters. An increased variability was shown in the reference ranges for all white blood cell indices between patients with schizophrenia and the population without schizophrenia. Certain reference values also showed heterogeneity for gender, age, and racial descent. This study suggests that abnormal hematologic findings in patients with schizophrenia should be assessed in the context of a valid reference range.

Caudate nucleus volume and TD were assessed before discontinuing typical antipsychotics and after 24 weeks of treatment with clozapine. After discontinuing typical antipsychotics, symptoms were assessed in a 3 days drug-free period and subsequently once a month. Treatment with clozapine resulted in a decrease in caudate volume, improvement in symptoms and amelioration of TD. However, no difference in caudate volume changes was found between responders and non-responders to clozapine and no correlations were found between caudate volume changes and reduction of TD. In conclusion, this study replicates earlier findings that clozapine decreases caudate volume in patients previously treated with typical antipsychotics and suggests that this effect is unrelated to treatment response or to amelioration of TD.",5,E

Symptoms indicating mania were assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) excitement and grandiosity items and by the excited cluster (excitement, hostility, uncooperativeness, and poor impulse control); anxious / depressive symptoms were assessed by the PANSS anxious / depressive cluster (somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feelings, and depression). Mean change scores from baseline to endpoint were compared in patients receiving risperidone, haloperidol or placebo by analysis of variance with factors for trial and baseline score included in the model. In all patients, change scores on excitement and grandiosity items and excited and anxious / depressive clusters were significantly greater for risperidone than for haloperidol or placebo. Dropouts due to inefficacy were less frequent with risperidone (5 of 59; 8%) than with haloperidol (7 of 38; 18%) or placebo (8 of 10; 80%). In patients with anxious / depressive symptoms at baseline (anxiety / depression cluster score > or = the median), anxiety / depression scores decreased significantly more with risperidone than with haloperidol, and symptom reduction occurred faster with risperidone. These results are consistent with previous reports and suggest that risperidone is more efficacious than haloperidol for affective symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.",I,6

Because improved motor functioning may enable better performance on some components of cognitive test batteries, and because the advantages of the novel antipsychotics on cognitive performance are not very large, it is sometimes difficult to discern if improvement in a given cognitive task is due to a direct effect of the novel antipsychotic drug, or is secondary to the novel drug's decreased propensity to induce EPS. In an attempt to distinguish between these two possibilities, the present study examined the ability of patients suffering from schizophrenia receiving classic, versus novel antipsychotics, to perform a computerized visuo-motor test (VMT). VMT assesses planning capabilities, attention and executive functions known to be impaired in schizophrenia, which are suggested to be affected by novel antipsychotics.; Seventy-six patients suffering from schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder, receiving haloperidol (23 patients, mean dose 10.01+/-6.1mg/day), olanzapine (26 patients, mean dose 10.56 +/- 4.9 mg/day) or risperidone (27 patients, mean dose 4.35 +/- 1.7 mg/day) were assessed for EPS using the parkinsonian subscale of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Subscale (ESRS), and with the VMT.; Cognitive functioning as measured by the VMT was better for patients receiving risperidone or olanzapine, compared with those receiving haloperidol (F=6.636, df=2,67, P=0. 002), while the patients receiving haloperidol or risperidone suffered from more severe EPS compared with the patients receiving olanzapine (F=3.996, df=2,71, P=0.023).; Although the patients receiving risperidone suffered from EPS similar in severity to the EPS of the patients receiving haloperidol, their performance on a task involving visuo-motor and attentional skills was similar to that of the patients receiving olanzapine. This finding implies that there is a dissociation between the antipsychotic drug's ability to affect cognitive functioning, and EPS. This dissociation indirectly suggests that the advantages offered by novel antipsychotics on cognitive performance are a direct effect, rather than being entirely mediated by improved movement abilities.",I,5

Additional objectives of this trial were comparing the antipsychotic effectiveness of the two treatments and the use of antiparkinsonian medication.; Effects of flexible doses of risperidone and haloperidol were compared in 77 psychotic patients (83% with chronic schizophrenia) with disturbing neuroleptic-induced EPS (risperidone 40 patients, haloperidol 37). The trial was completed by 47 patients: 25 in the risperidone group (12 women, 13 men), and 22 in the haloperidol group (10 women, 12 men).; An adequate antipsychotic effect was obtained in most patients by both treatments. The primary aim of this trial was comparing parkinsonism measured with the extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale (ESRS) during treatment with risperidone and haloperidol. Two primary parameters were selected: the change from baseline to the worst score during treatment of ESRS II (parkinsonism) and ESRS VI (clinical global impression of severity of parkinsonism). The CGI of severity of parkinsonism was better with risperidone (P=0.025), while the parkinsonism total score tended to be better with risperidone (P<0. 10). Before the double-blind treatment, 34 (of the 77) had used antiparkinson medication (risperidone 18, haloperidol 16). During the double-blind treatment phase, 21 patients had used antiparkinson medication (risperidone 11, haloperidol 10). The larger reduction of parkinsonism in the risperidone group was not due to a difference in the use of anti-parkinsonian medication.; In this group of schizophrenic patients with disturbing EPS during previous neuroleptic treatment, a stronger reduction of parkinsonism was observed with risperidone than with haloperidol.",I,I

Novel antipsychotic treatment has been reported to improve certain cognitive skills in schizophrenic patients, but no information is yet available about the effect of newer medications on skill learning.; Clinically stable patients with schizophrenia (n=16) and chronically hospitalized inpatients (n=8) were recruited while receiving conventional antipsychotic treatment. Subjects were tested at baseline on a visual continuous performance test (CPT), performed alone and simultaneously with an auditory CPT. Normal controls (n=8) were also tested at baseline. The inpatients and half of the outpatients were switched to treatment with risperidone. All patients then performed the visual CPT on a daily basis and performed the dual tasks once per week, for 4weeks.; Patients who remained on conventional medications did not improve in their performance despite the extensive practice on the test. Both chronic and stable patients receiving risperidone treatment manifested a statistically significant (P<0.05) improvement from baseline on both single and dual-task visual CPT. Stable outpatients performed significantly better at the end of the protocol than the normal controls performance at baseline (P<0.05).; These results suggest that practice-related improvements in the performance of information processing tests are enhanced by novel antipsychotic medications. Although the specific biological mechanism of this effect is not yet known, the results may suggest that use of newer medications will enhance skill development and perhaps facilitate rehabilitation of patients with schizophrenia.",2,E

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups: olanzapine plus placebo, fluoxetine plus placebo, or olanzapine plus fluoxetine.; Fluoxetine monotherapy produced minimal improvement on various scales that rate severity of depression. The benefits of olanzapine monotherapy were modest. Olanzapine plus fluoxetine produced significantly greater improvement than either monotherapy on one measure and significantly greater improvement than olanzapine monotherapy on the other measures after 1 week. There were no significant differences between treatment groups on extrapyramidal measures nor significant adverse drug interactions.; Olanzapine plus fluoxetine demonstrated superior efficacy for treating resistant depression compared to either agent alone.",4,E

A mirror-image design was used with duration to a maximum of 1 year before and 1 year after initiation of risperidone. The hospital population that did not receive either risperidone or clozapine during the same time period was used for comparison of trends of seclusion and restraint.; Seventy-four patients (most with schizophrenia) met the inclusion criteria of the risperidone group. There were statistically significant decreases in the number of seclusion hours (2.2 [SD 5.5] to 0.26 [SD 0.06]) and of events (0.23 [SD 0.59] to 0.05 [SD 0.14]) per person per month during risperidone treatment, compared with the prerisperidone treatment period (P = 0.01). The comparison group also evidenced decreases on these measures during the same time period, but the risperidone-treated cohort achieved a proportionally greater reduction. There were similar trends toward reduction in the restraint measures during risperidone treatment compared with prerisperidone, but these did not achieve statistical significance. The comparison group also showed slightly decreased use of restraints over the study period.; Risperidone appears to have had a positive impact on seclusion in this state-hospital psychiatric population. These data support the positive impact of risperidone on violence found in other studies. Violence and aggression are major factors that affect morale among psychiatric patients and staff. So, any benefit in this regard as a result of antipsychotic drug treatment is salutary for patients, families, and health care providers.",I,4

Some drug-induced agranulocytoses such as clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CA) may be regarded as an idiosyncratic drug reaction because of its preclinical and clinical characteristics. To study some aspects of the genetic background of CA further, polymorphisms of specific metabolizing enzyme systems of clozapine were examined. Thirty-one schizophrenic patients with CA and 77 schizophrenic comparison subjects without this adverse effect underwent genotyping of a recently discovered G(-463)A polymorphism of myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene and cytochrome P4502D6. Neither the MPO mutation nor specific genotypes of cytochrome P4502D6 were associated with CA. Both were equally distributed among CA patients and controls. Thus, our data suggest lack of evidence of an association of CA and genetically variable activity of these specific drug metabolizing enzymes; however, this may be due to statistical reasons only. Thus, further studies with greater CA samples are necessary to draw final conclusions about these genetically based hypotheses.",5,E

Seven schizophrenic inpatients volunteered to receive, in addition to their previous drug regimen, either 250 mg ciprofloxacin or placebo twice daily (b.i.d.) for 7 days. The phases were separated by a 7-day wash-out period. Serum concentrations of clozapine and its main metabolite N-desmethylclozapine were measured during both phases before the first dose on day 1 and on days 3 and 8.; Ciprofloxacin increased mean serum concentration of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine by 29% (P < 0.01) and 31% (P < 0.05), respectively. There was a significant positive correlation (r = 0.90, P < 0.01) between the individual concentrations of serum ciprofloxacin and the increase in concentrations of clozapine plus N-desmethylclozapine. The increase in serum clozapine concentrations correlated significantly (r = 0.89, P < 0.01) with the ratios of N-desmethylclozapine to clozapine concentrations.; Even a low dose of ciprofloxacin can moderately increase serum concentrations of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine. A probable mechanism of interaction is an inhibition of CYP1A2 enzyme by ciprofloxacin. The possibility of clinically significant interaction should be considered, especially when higher doses of ciprofloxacin are used concomitantly with clozapine.",4,E

The authors reviewed the charts of these patients to determine several variables, including whether and when they had received clozapine. A Poisson regression model was used to regress arrest rates against the variables of age, sex, onset of illness, birth cohort, and clozapine treatment. Risk ratios (i.e., percent change in arrest rates) were then calculated by computing the exponential of the Poisson regression coefficients.; The 165 patients included in the analysis had a total of 1,126 arrests. The mean number of arrests was 6.8. Differences were found between the 65 patients who received clozapine and the 100 patients who did not in number of arrests, sex, and onset of illness. The regression revealed significantly higher arrest rate estimates associated with more recent birth cohort (4.8%) and with onset of illness (64.6%) and lower arrest rate estimates associated with higher levels of education (11.6%), receiving clozapine (32.6%), and receiving clozapine during specific periods of time (68.9%).; Clozapine's effect on arrest rates in this group of patients is large enough to warrant further investigation.

The incidence and prevalence of drug-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia (TD) are significantly greater in the older patient than in the younger patient whereas akathisia seems to occur evenly across the age spectrum and dystonia is uncommon among older patients. The literature on risk factors associated with treatment-emergent movement disorders is highly variable. Treatment practices vary across the age range and the interaction between age and antipsychotic dosage confounds our understanding of the relative importance of treatment-related risk factors. However, there is general agreement that pre-existing extrapyramidal signs (EPS) increase the vulnerability of the patient to developing significant drug-induced movement disorders. Elderly patients with dementia are at greater risk than patients without dementia for persistent drug-induced EPS. Management of drug-induced movement disorders in the older patient requires careful consideration of the contraindications imposed by such agents as anticholinergics and beta-blockers. At present, well-controlled double-blind studies of second-generation antipsychotics such as clozapine, risperidone. olanzapine or quetiapine for reducing the risk of treatment-emergent movement disorders in the elderly have not been published. However, open-label studies of atypical antipsychotics demonstrate a markedly lower incidence of both EPS and TD compared with conventional antipsychotic treatment in the elderly. There is emerging literature in support of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of existing drug-induced movement disorders. More controversial is the use of adjunctive antioxidants in newly treated patients who are vulnerable to drug-induced movement disorders. While the evidence is mixed in support of antioxidants for the treatment of TD, the possibility remains that prophylactic use of antioxidants may help reduce the incidence of TD. The development of a drug-induced movement disorder often reduces the quality of life in an elderly patient. Effective pharmacological management requires cooperation from the patient and family, which can be fostered early in the patient's care through proper informed consent. The risks and benefits of antipsychotic treatment in the elderly patient need to be communicated to the patient and family. At the present time, there is no consistently effective treatment for patients with TD once it develops. Therefore, attention should focus on its prevention and close monitoring.",I,E

Although much of the data is anecdotal or in the form of open studies, there is now emerging a small number of well controlled investigations supporting efficacy for mania, dementia, behavioural disturbance in mental retardation and conduct disorder. Conventional antipsychotics have long been used, either in a primary capacity or as an adjunct to treat these disorders; however, they have limited benefit, pose significant risks of extrapyramidal side-effects, and may cause the potentially life-threatening neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

For 10 years, clozapine has been the standard treatment in this condition and is recognized unequivocally as being effective. However, clozapine is sometimes poorly tolerated and has the potential for severe toxicity. Partly as a result of this, other atypicals have recently been evaluated as treatments for refractory schizophrenia. In order to evaluate the evidence base relating to the drug treatment of refractory schizophrenia, we developed a refractoriness rating based on previous work. Using this rating, we assessed all trials of atypicals in schizophrenia unresponsive to at least one drug. Overall, clozapine was consistently shown to be effective in refractory schizophrenia, even when stringently defined. Data relating to olanzapine and risperidone are equivocal at best, and there is some evidence to suggest that they are less effective than clozapine. There is essentially no cogent evidence to support the use of any other atypical in refractory schizophrenia. Clozapine remains the drug of choice in this condition.",I,I

Olanzapine plasma concentrations > or = 9.3 ng/mL (24 hours postdose) have been identified as a predictor of clinical response in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia. The authors report a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of 12-hour olanzapine concentrations and treatment response from the North American Double-Blind Olanzapine Trial. After a 4- to 7-day placebo lead-in, patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine, haloperidol, or placebo. Patients who were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine were given daily doses ranging from 2.5 to 17.5 mg/day for up to 6 weeks. Blood samples for the determination of olanzapine plasma concentrations were obtained between 10 and 16 hours (11.7 +/- 1.7 hours) after the last dose was administered. Therapeutic response data and olanzapine concentrations used for analysis were obtained from the endpoint visit for each patient if the patient had been receiving a fixed olanzapine dose for at least the last 2 weeks of the study. Plasma concentrations from previous visits were used if endpoint concentrations were invalid. Response was defined as a > or = 20% reduction in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores and a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity scale score of < or = 3 or a final BPRS score of < or = 35. The final ROC analysis included data from 84 patients and suggested an olanzapine concentration > or = 23.2 ng/mL to be a predictor of therapeutic response. Fifty-two percent of patients with 12-hour olanzapine concentrations > or = 23.2 ng/mL responded, whereas only 25% of patients with concentrations < 23.2 ng/mL responded. Furthermore, an olanzapine concentration > or = 23.2 ng/mL was a predictor of response in the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (> or = 20% decrease and endpoint CGI < or = 3). Olanzapine concentrations were found to be a function of olanzapine dose (in milligrams per day) and gender such that prospective olanzapine dosing is feasible. A 12-hour olanzapine plasma concentration of > 23.2 ng/mL was a predictor of therapeutic response in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia. Males required a higher olanzapine dose to reach this threshold concentration than their female counterparts.",2,2

Data were taken from subsets of patients with schizoaffective disorder, derived from two separate double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter studies. A total of 115 hospitalized patients with an acute episode of schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to receive either fixed oral doses of ziprasidone 40 mg/day (N = 16), 80 mg/day (N = 18), 120 mg/day (N = 22), 160 mg/day (N = 25), or placebo (N = 34) for 4 to 6 weeks. Mean baseline-to-endpoint changes in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total, BPRS Core, Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale (CGI-S), BPRS Depressive, BPRS Manic, and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total scores were compared between the placebo and ziprasidone groups. Neurological (Simpson-Angus, Barnes Akathisia, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale [AIMS]) and other side effects were also assessed. Significant dose-related improvements on all primary efficacy variables (BPRS total, BPRS Core, CGI-S) and for BPRS Manic items were observed with ziprasidone treatment in a combined analysis of data from both studies (p < or = 0.01). Ziprasidone 160 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo in improving mean BPRS total, BPRS Core, BPRS Manic, and CGI-S scores (p < 0.05). At 120 mg/day, ziprasidone was significantly more effective than placebo in improving mean CGI-S scores (p < 0.05). The incidence of individual adverse events was generally low in all treatment groups and was not dose-related. In addition, no significant differences were observed between baseline-to-endpoint mean changes in Simpson-Angus and AIMS scores with placebo or ziprasidone 40 to 160 mg/day. These results suggest that ziprasidone may have efficacy in the treatment of affective as well as psychotic symptoms of schizoaffective disorder, with a low side-effect burden.",4,E

This study demonstrated that the potent cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducer phenytoin did indeed have a marked effect on the metabolism of quetiapine, resulting in a 5-fold increase in clearance when administered concomitantly to patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder.

Patients with a concurrent DSM-IV axis I diagnosis were excluded. Symptoms, mood and cognitive function were evaluated following ATD or ingestion of a control drink.; The depleting drink significantly reduced plasma total and free tryptophan. Tryptophan/LNAA ratios did not alter with the administration of the control drink, but differed significantly with ATD; however there was no significant change in tyrosine/LNAA ratio. ATD led to impairment in executive function that was dependent upon the order of administration. Tests of sustained attention, speed of processing, and everyday memory were not affected. No effects were observed on subjective mood ratings, movement disorders or PANSS scores.; Acute tryptophan depletion selectively alters cognition in schizophrenia, but has no effect on symptoms, mood ratings or movement disorders.",3,E

This extension examined the chronic safety and efficacy of clozapine in the treatment of drug-induced psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD).; Psychosis is a serious late complication of PD and may be a harbinger to increased mortality. Clozapine, the first atypical antipsychotic, was shown in several small open label studies to improve psychosis without worsening of motor symptoms. This was recently confirmed in the double-blind PSYCLOPS trial.; The 53 patients who completed the double-blind portion of PSYCLOPS were evaluated on their original randomized treatment (clozapine or placebo), then had study medication stopped. All were started on clozapine. The patients from both treatment groups were evaluated every 4 weeks over a 12-week period using standardized measures for psychosis and PD.; The mean dose of clozapine was 28.78 mg/day. Those originally treated with placebo improved significantly in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and clinical global scores for psychosis to the same degree as the group originally randomized to clozapine in the double-blind study. Both groups maintained their response to week 16 (end of the combined double-blind and open label portions). There was no worsening of motor features as measured by the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale. Eighteen patients were either hospitalized or died during the trial. The most common reasons were pulmonary.; Low-dose clozapine is effective in treating drug-induced psychosis without worsening motor features of PD, and the response is maintained for at least 4 months. Patients with psychosis and PD were previously described as a group with high risk for morbidity and mortality. The high risk continues despite antipsychotic therapy.",I,4

Compared with conventional antipsychotics, it has greater affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A than for dopamine D2 receptors. In large, well controlled trials in patients with schizophrenia or related psychoses, olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day was significantly superior to haloperidol 5 to 20 mg/day in overall improvements in psychopathology rating scales and in the treatment of depressive and negative symptoms, and was comparable in effects on positive psychotic symptoms. The 1-year risk of relapse (rehospitalisation) was significantly lower with olanzapine than with haloperidol treatment. In the first double-blind comparative study (28-week) of olanzapine and risperidone, olanzapine 10 to 20 mg/day proved to be significantly more effective than risperidone 4 to 12 mg/day in the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms but not on overall psychopathology symptoms. In contrast, preliminary results from an 8-week controlled study suggested risperidone 2 to 6 mg/day was superior to olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day against positive and anxiety/depressive symptoms (p < 0.05), although consistent with the first study, both agents demonstrated similar efficacy on measures of overall psychopathology. Improvements in general cognitive function seen with olanzapine treatment in a 1-year controlled study of patients with early-phase schizophrenia, were significantly greater than changes seen with either risperidone or haloperidol. However, preliminary results from an 8-week trial showed comparable cognitive enhancing effects of olanzapine and risperidone treatment in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Several studies indicate that olanzapine has benefits against symptoms of aggression and agitation, while other studies strongly support the effectiveness of olanzapine in the treatment of depressive symptomatology. Olanzapine is associated with significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms than haloperidol and risperidone. In addition, olanzapine is not associated with a risk of agranulocytosis as seen with clozapine or clinically significant hyperprolactinaemia as seen with risperidone or prolongation of the QT interval. The most common adverse effects reported with olanzapine are bodyweight gain, somnolence, dizziness, anticholinergic effects (constipation and dry mouth) and transient asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations. In comparison with haloperidol, the adverse events reported significantly more frequently with olanzapine in > or = 3.5% of patients were dry mouth, bodyweight gain and increased appetite and compared with risperidone, only bodyweight gain occurred significantly more frequently with olanzapine. The high acquisition cost of olanzapine is offset by reductions in other treatment costs (inpatient and/or outpatient services) of schizophrenia. Pharmacoeconomic analyses indicate that olanzapine does not significantly increase, and may even decrease, the overall direct treatment costs of schizophrenia, compared with haloperidol. Compared with risperidone, olanzapine has also been reported to decrease overall treatment costs, despite the several-fold higher daily acquisition cost of the drug. Olanzapine treatment improves quality of life in patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses to a greater extent than haloperidol, and to broadly the same extent as risperidone.; Olanzapine demonstrated superior antipsychotic efficacy compared with haloperidol in the treatment of acute phase schizophrenia, and in the treatment of some patients with first-episode or treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The reduced risk of adverse events and therapeutic superiority compared with haloperidol and risperidone in the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms support the choice of olanzapine as a first-line option in the management of schizophrenia in the acute phase and for the maintenance of treatment response.",I,5

Furthermore, they induce less extrapyramidal effects. However, following clinical use, marked bodyweight gain has been frequently observed with some of the atypical antipsychotic drugs. In order to examine and compare the frequency, amount and conditions of bodyweight gain during treatment with atypical antipsychotics, studies concerning bodyweight gain with these agents were identified through a MEDLINE search from 1966 to March 2000. Although comparison is limited by the different designs and recruitment procedures of the reviewed studies, the available data support the notion that the frequency as well as the amount of bodyweight gain is high in patients treated with olanzapine (average bodyweight gain 2.3 kg/month), clozapine (1.7 kg/month), quetiapine (1.8 kg/month), and possibly also zotepine (2.3 kg/month). Moderate changes in bodyweight have been observed in the treatment with risperidone (average bodyweight gain 1.0 kg/month). Ziprasidone seems to induce only slight bodyweight changes (0.8 kg/month). Bodyweight gain most frequently occurs in the first 12 weeks of treatment. Patients who were underweight at the beginning of treatment are at highest risk of gaining bodyweight. The underlying pathomechanism still remains largely unclear. The relative receptor affinities of the atypical antipsychotics for histamine H1 receptors as well as the ratio of their affinity for serotonin 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptors appear to be the most robust correlate of bodyweight gain. Furthermore, the induction of leptin secretion may have an important impact on bodyweight gain in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Although many questions concerning the pathogenesis of bodyweight gain remain unresolved, this adverse effect has to be taken into consideration when prescribing the atypical antipsychotics, particularly in view its affect on compliance during long term treatment and the long term effects of obesity on mortality and morbidity.",I,5

To facilitate economic comparisons, our sample was restricted to patients enrolled in US sites. 150 patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or schizophreniform disorder were randomised to therapy with either olanzapine 10 to 20 mg/day (n = 75) or risperidone 4 to 12 mg/day (n = 75) for a maximum of 28 weeks. In addition to tolerability and efficacy assessments, use of health services was assessed at baseline and prospectively, at 8-week intervals and at study completion. Clinically important response, defined as a 40% improvement in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score, maintenance of response and rates of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms were compared between groups. Direct medical costs were estimated by assigning standardised prices to resource units. Median total, inpatient/outpatient service and medication acquisition costs were compared between treatment groups.; The mean modal dosages for the olanzapine and risperidone treatment groups were 17.7 +/- 3.4 mg/day and 7.9 +/- 3.2 mg/day, respectively. Olanzapine-treated patients were more likely to maintain response compared with risperidone-treated patients (p = 0.048). In addition, a smaller proportion of olanzapine-treated patients required anticholinergic therapy compared with risperidone-treated patients (25.3 vs 45.3%; p = 0.016). Total per patient medical costs over the study interval were $US2843 (1997 values) [36%] lower in the olanzapine treatment group than in the risperidone treatment group (p = 0.342). Medication costs were significantly higher for olanzapine-treated patients ($US2513 vs $US1581; p < 0.001), but this difference was offset by a reduction of $US3774 (52%) in inpatient/outpatient service costs for olanzapine-treated patients in comparison with risperidone-treated patients ($US3516 vs $US7291, p = 0.083). Median cost findings were consistent with results observed using other robust measures of central tendency and provide conservative estimates of potential savings that may be obtained from olanzapine therapy.; In this study, olanzapine-treated patients experienced clinical improvements that translated into savings in costs of care for both inpatient and outpatient services. These savings offset the difference in medication acquisition cost between olanzapine and risperidone.",I,I

We sought to examine the efficacy of augmentation of antipsychotic treatment with pindolol in the amelioration of aggression. Thirty male inpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, aged 20-65 years involved in four or more aggressive incidents in the two previous months, were enrolled in a double-blind crossover study. Aggression was evaluated per incident, with the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS). Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was administered at baseline, crossover and at endpoint. Patients received either pindolol or placebo augmentation 5 mg x three times a day until crossover, then switched.

The findings of pharmacoeconomic studies assist psychiatrists and mental healthcare decision-makers in identifying therapies that provide the greatest benefit to patients at the most acceptable cost. The cost-effectiveness of the newer atypical antipsychotics has been examined using non-controlled cohort studies (either retrospective or prospective), modelling studies or randomised clinical trials. The evidence, from a variety of studies, indicates that clozapine is a cost-effective treatment for neuroleptic refractory schizophrenia. Risperidone and olanzapine may be cost neutral, or at best slightly cost saving, compared with conventional antipsychotics, although they do improve patient clinical effectiveness and quality of life outcomes. There is too little data on pharmacoeconomic outcomes for sertindole and quetiapine to make any conclusions about their cost-effectiveness in treating schizophrenia.",5,E

Research on surrogate endpoints has received substantial attention lately, but most investigations have focused on the validity of using a single biomarker as a surrogate. Our paper studies whether the use of multiple markers can improve inferences about a treatment's effects on a clinical endpoint. We propose a joint model for a time to clinical event and for repeated measures over time on multiple biomarkers that are potential surrogates. This model extends the formulation of Xu and Zeger (2001, in press) and Fawcett and Thomas (1996, Statistics in Medicine 15, 1663-1685). We propose two complementary measures of the relative benefit of multiple surrogates as opposed to a single one. Markov chain Monte Carlo is implemented to estimate model parameters. The methodology is illustrated with an analysis of data from a schizophrenia clinical trial.",5,E

The Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS), Clinical Global Impression, and Hamilton Depression ratings were administered weekly. Lorazepam as rescue medication was permitted for the first 10 days.; Five subjects were randomized to placebo and one to olanzapine. Two subjects (40%) with psychotic mania (who also had their first-illness episode) were assigned to placebo and responded with greater than 50% reduction in the Y-MRS score and also remitted in 3 weeks. Another placebo-assigned subject had a 46% reduction in the Y-MRS scores, and two placebo-assigned subjects worsened. The olanzapine-assigned subject had a 44% reduction in the Y-MRS score. In contrast, 34 of 69 (48.6%) multiple-episode olanzapine subjects responded and 14 of 61 (23.0%) of placebo-treated subjects did.; This preliminary data set suggest there may be differences in treatment response between first-illness episode versus multi-episode bipolar manic subjects. Larger numbers of subjects with these illness characteristics are needed to either confirm or refute this suggestion.",I,I

The studies that are available have significant methodologic problems, including the mixing of early- and late-onset patients, inadequate outcome criteria, and the lack of control groups. Studies of conventional neuroleptics suggest that older patients have a moderate therapeutic response but are likely to develop side effects. The few studies of atypical antipsychotics now available suggest efficacy for treatment of behavioral disturbance in the elderly and a more favorable side-effect profile. The usefulness of all neuroleptics for the treatment of the core symptoms of late-life schizophrenia may depend on the duration and severity of the symptoms, with a poor response associated with greater severity and duration. It appears that patients with later-onset symptoms may respond better to all neuroleptics.",5,E

These advances have high per-unit direct costs that may have a profound effect on drug budgets of systems caring for persons with schizophrenia. The objective of this study was to describe the changes in utilization and cost for antipsychotic prescriptions by atypical, clozapine, decanoate products, and traditional neuroleptics in a large naturalistic setting, i.e. the Georgia Medicaid population. Secondly, this study forecasted the categorized antipsychotic prescription utilization through the year 2002. Administrative claims data spanning 1990-1997 for Medicaid eligible persons suffering from schizophrenia in the state of Georgia were supplemented with psychiatric institutional data obtained from the Georgia Department of Human Resources. A total of 16227 Medicaid-eligible recipients had a code indicative of schizophrenia (ICD-9-CM=295.(**)) and were at least 16 years of age at the time of their first diagnosis. The mean recipient prescription use and expenditures were tallied for each month of the study and stratified by prescription category (atypical, clozapine, decanoate, and traditional antipsychotic). ARIMA time series models were identified and estimated using these monthly PMPM utilization and expenditures estimates to forecast 5 years beyond the last month of the study. The total use of antipsychotics increased modestly throughout the study period, and the use of atypicals, clozapine, and decanoate products increased substantially, while a decrease was observed for traditional antipsychotics. In 1995 dollars, antipsychotic expenditures increased from a mean of approximately $10 PMPM in 1990 to $95 projected for the year 2002. This transition from traditional oral antipsychotics to atypicals and decanoate products has a profound effect on drug expenditures for systems paying for the care of persons with schizophrenia. Further studies to determine the value of the transitions of therapy described in this study need to be evaluated using a system-wide- or Medicaid perspective.",2,E

Baseline, 3month and 6month psychopathological and cognitive evaluations were made. Thirty-eight partially responsive outpatients with DSM-IV chronic schizophrenia diagnosis were included in the study. On the indication of their attending psychiatrists, 21 patients initiated treatment with olanzapine, and 17 remained on their previous treatment with other antipsychotic drugs. Cognitive assessments were blind to medication and psychopathological status. The olanzapine group presented a significantly greater improvement in negative symptomatology and verbal memory than the comparison group in repeated-measures of MANOVAs between baseline, 3month and 6month assessments. These differences remained statistically significant after covarying out gender, treatment with other atypical antipsychotics, biperidene doses and changes in positive and negative symptoms. In order to match previous differences between groups, cognitive baseline scores for each test were introduced as covariates, resulting in a significant improvement for the olanzapine group in negative symptomatology and the interference task of the Stroop test.We then re-analyzed the data, dividing the comparison group into two groups: risperidone-treated patients (n=9) and patients receiving conventional antipsychotic drugs (n=8). Post-hoc analyses between groups were carried out with baseline cognitive assessment as covariate. The olanzapine group improved significantly more than the risperidone group in negative symptomatology and in the interference task of Stroop test. The improvement in the number of categories of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test was higher in risperidone patients than in those receiving olanzapine or conventional antipsychotic treatment. Conventional antipsychotic drugs did not present a significant improvement over atypical antipsychotic drugs in any cognitive function. In summary, in patients suffering from chronic schizophrenia, atypical antipsychotic agents were associated with slight differential improvements over time in attentional, verbal memory and executive functions compared with conventional neuroleptic drugs. No differential improvements were found in social functioning, verbal fluency, non-verbal domains of memory or visuo-motor abilities.",I,I

A double blind, 28 day, placebo-controlled study was conducted with three groups of women of child-bearing age (N=12 in each group) who received standardized antipsychotic medication plus 50mcg transdermal estradiol or 100mcg transdermal estradiol or transdermal placebo. Analyses show that women receiving 100mcg of estradiol made greater improvements in the symptoms of schizophrenia than both the 50mcg estradiol and placebo groups. Women receiving 50mcg estradiol had more improvement in their symptoms compared with the placebo group. The 100mcg estradiol group had significantly lower mean lutenizing hormone (LH) and higher mean prolactin levels across the study period compared with both the 50mcg and placebo groups. The addition of 100mcg adjunctive transdermal estrogen significantly enhanced the treatment of acute, severe psychotic symptoms in women with schizophrenia. The differential response of adding 50mcg versus 100mcg estradiol on the types of symptom affected may be related to the estrogen effect on LH and prolactin. The positive impact of estrogen treatment on psychotic symptoms by a direct effect on dopamine and serotonin systems or via an indirect prolactin-mediated effect may be very useful in the overall treatment of women with schizophrenia.",5,E

For the seven studies that compared clozapine to a typical antipsychotic, a meta-analysis was performed to examine clozapine's effects on overall psychopathology, response rate, extrapyramidal symptoms, and tardive dyskinesia.; The meta-analysis confirmed that treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients have more favorable outcomes when treated with clozapine rather than a typical antipsychotic, as reflected by Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score, categorical response rate, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms score, Simpson-Angus Rating Scale score, and compliance rate. Clozapine also conferred benefits on the sickest treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients. Patients treated with olanzapine also had more favorable outcomes with regard to categorical response and compliance rates.; In the aggregate, the results of a meta-analysis indicated that clozapine exhibits superiority over typical antipsychotics in terms of both efficacy (as measured by improvement in overall psychopathology) and safety (in terms of reduced extrapyramidal side effects). However, the magnitude of the clozapine treatment effect was not consistently robust. Efficacy data for other second-generation antipsychotics in the treatment of patients with refractory schizophrenia were inconclusive. There is, therefore, a growing need to consider new and different treatment strategies, whether they be adjunctive or monotherapeutic, for schizophrenia that continues to be resistant or only partially responsive to treatment.",I,6

These volumes did not differ between the first-episode patients and healthy comparison subjects. Basal ganglia volumes were unchanged after 1 year of exposure to risperidone in the first-episode subjects. Extrapyramidal movement disorders were present in the majority of chronically treated patients and more than one-third of the never-medicated first-episode patients at baseline.; This group of first-episode patients did not exhibit abnormalities of basal ganglia volumes, nor were basal ganglia volumes affected by exposure to risperidone.

We surveyed relevant practice guidelines, review articles, and individual studies and developed summary statements regarding evidence-supported procedures for short-term inpatient stabilization. If the patient requires parenteral treatment, the combination of intramuscular haloperidol 2-5 mg and lorazepam has the earliest effect. For initial oral treatment, monotherapy with one of the new ""atypical"" antipsychotics is favored. Some evidence suggests that risperidone may have an earlier onset of action. Olanzapine seems to have a relatively more rapid effect when started at a daily dose of 15 mg, rather than 5 or 10 mg. The role of quetiapine is somewhat unclear. In the event of nonresponse to the initial antipsychotic after 3-7 days, alternatives may include increasing the dose, switching to a different antipsychotic, or adding a mood stabilizer.",5,E

Four measures were used to rate tolerability to T4 treatment. Subjective response was graded on a scale ranging from -33 (maximal negative response) to +33 (maximal positive response). Positive and negative effects were assessed on a structured questionnaire.

The objective of this study was to determine the relative efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral risperidone versus intramuscular haloperidol, both in combination with lorazepam, for the emergency treatment of psychotic agitation in patients who are able to accept oral medications.; A convenience sample of psychotic patients admitted to a large psychiatric emergency service who required emergency medication for the control of agitation and/or violence was offered risperidone (2 mg liquid concentrate) and oral lorazepam (2 mg) as an alternative to standard care at the institution, haloperidol (5 mg i.m.) and lorazepam (2 mg i.m.). Subjects who refused the oral medications were given the intramuscular treatment as a component of routine care.; Thirty patients were enrolled in each treatment group. Although men were significantly more likely to choose oral medication (chi2 = 5.165, p < .023), other demographic characteristics did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment groups. Both groups showed similar improvement in agitation as measured by 5 agitation subscales of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale, and time to sedation. No patients receiving risperidone demonstrated any side effects or adverse events, while 1 patient receiving intramuscular treatment with haloperidol developed acute dystonia. One subject receiving risperidone required subsequent treatment with haloperidol for ongoing agitation.; Oral treatment with risperidone and lorazepam appears to be a tolerable and comparable alternative to intramuscular haloperidol and lorazepam for short-term treatment of agitated psychosis in patients who accept oral medications.",I,4

The present study examines the relative effectiveness of risperidone and typical antipsychotics in patients being treated for their first episode of schizophrenia.; From a cohort of 126 patients, 2 groups of 19 first-episode DSM-III-R/DSM-IV schizophrenia patients matched for age, gender, length of illness, and length of treatment and treated with either a typical antipsychotic or risperidone for a minimum of 1 year were compared on a number of outcome dimensions during their course of treatment and at follow-up. Treatment allocation was not random, and patients were judged to be compliant with medication. Patients treated with typical antipsychotics were followed up for a statistically nonsignificantly longer time (mean = 2.7 vs. 1.9 years).; Six patients (31.6%) from the typical antipsychotic group were admitted to the hospital within the first year following the index admission compared with 1 patient (5.3%) in the risperidone group (admitted at month 14). Patients in the risperidone group showed a statistically significantly lower length of first hospitalization (p < .01), utilization of inpatient beds during the course of treatment (p < .001), and use of anticholinergic medication (p < .05). There were no statistically significant differences in symptom levels, either during the course of treatment or at follow-up; in the use of antidepressant, antianxiety, or mood-stabilizing drugs; or in changes in living circumstances or employment.; These findings confirm at least equal long-term efficacy of typical antipsychotics and risperidone, but a possible advantage for risperidone in decreased service utilization and decreased use of anticholinergic drugs.",I,I

These analyses were conducted to characterize any change in QTc temporally associated with olanzapine, compared with placebo, haloperidol, and risperidone, in acutely psychotic patients (DSM-III-R and DSM-IV) and to characterize variability and temporal course of the QTc in this patient population. Changes from baseline to minimum and maximum QTc were tested for significance, and baseline to acute-phase endpoint change in mean QTc was tested for significance within treatments and for differences between olanzapine and comparators. The possibility of a linear relationship between dose of olanzapine and mean change in QTc, as well as incidence of treatment-emergent prolongation of QTc (change from < 430 msec at baseline to > or =430 msec at endpoint), was tested.; The incidence of maximum QTc > or = 450 msec during treatment was approximately equal to the incidence of QTc > or =450 msec at baseline.; Results of these analyses suggest that olanzapine, as therapeutically administered to patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses, does not contribute to QTc prolongation resulting in potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias.",5,E

The severity of schizophrenic symptoms during treatment as well as subjective evaluation of first effects of the drug did not differ among subjects treated with classic or atypical drugs. Depressive symptoms decreased significantly during treatment with atypicals but not with classic drugs. Also a significant decrease of depression was found under olanzapine treatment. The severity of neuroleptic-induced side-effects did not differ in both groups. Neurological side effects were more prominent in subjects after 4 weeks of therapy with risperidone, in comparison to patients receiving olanzapine. Forty-seven per-cent of patients showed a dysphoric reaction to the first dose of medication. After treatment with atypical drugs, better subjective evaluation of pharmacotherapy correlated with less severe general and depressive schizophrenia symptoms. Patients' better evaluation of olanzapine treatment correlated with less severe schizophrenic general symptomatology. The subjective evaluation of treatment was better in patients with less severe neurological side-effects of atypical drugs (including olanzapine but not risperidone) and less severe autonomic side-effects of classic drugs. The evaluation of pharmacotherapy made by patients' family members did not correlate with subjects' opinions after distribution of the first dose of the drugs, but correlated significantly with patients' opinion after 8-weeks of treatment. The treatment received by the patients was judged better by the family members if less severe neurological side-effects were present.",4,E

Pharmacological treatment studies in PBD have lagged far behind those in adults. Children are currently treated with pharmacological agents, most of which have proven efficacy in adults. However, PBD is distinct from adult forms of bipolar disorder (BD) and may present unique treatment challenges. PBD often presents with rapid cycling and mixed manic states and a high co-morbidity with behavioural and attention disorders. Early onset depression may also be an early sign of PBD. Due to developmental considerations, the diagnosis of BD may be difficult to make in children without semi-structured interviews. This report discusses the special issues that should be considered when treating PBD and reviews the current literature regarding pharmacotherapy of this population. Mood stabilisers have been studied mostly in an open, uncontrolled fashion but there is growing evidence that lithium, divalproex and carbamazepine are effective in treating PBD. More recent treatment options include atypical antipsychotics and newer anticonvulsants. Other novel agents are currently being investigated in adult BD and may prove applicable to the paediatric form. Finally, based on the available data, a treatment algorithm for PBD is proposed.",4,E

Although the mechanism is not yet known, it has been hypothesized that perhaps damage to the pancreatic islet cells, weight gain, dysregulation of the sympathetic system, and insulin resistance are contributing factors.; Diabetes mellitus secondary to olanzapine use seems to be a rare occurrence. However, certain risk factors such as obesity, family history, and concomitant medications may predispose an individual to development of diabetes mellitus while taking olanzapine. An increased awareness of this reaction is essential in the treatment of patients at risk. Periodic serum glucose monitoring in these individuals may be warranted.",I,6

However, it is yet unresolved whether atypical neuroleptics differ regarding subjective side-effects. A self-report instrument has been constructed to evaluate 'subjective well-being under neuroleptics' (SWN). The primary aims of the present study were to develop a short form of the SWN and to investigate the extent to which the atypical antipsychotic improves the patient's subjective well-being. The short form of the SWN was constructed following an item analysis based on data from 212 schizophrenic patients medicated with either typical or atypical antipsychotics. The short form of the SWN showed sufficient internal consistency and good construct validity. The SWN was only moderately correlated with positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) scores or changes in psychopathology (r=-0.20 to -0.37). SWN-ratings in patients receiving olanzapine were superior compared to those of patients medicated with either clozapine or risperidone on three of five domains of well-being.

A short-acting IM formulation of the novel antipsychotic, ziprasidone, which may offer advantages over conventional agents, has been developed.; To compare ziprasidone IM 2 mg (n=38) and 20 mg (n=41) in the acute control and short-term management of agitated psychotic patients.; A prospective, randomized, double-blind, 24-h study assessed efficacy using the Behavioral Activity Rating Scale (BARS) and the PANSS. The BARS is a validated rating scale for the assessment of treatment response in acute agitation associated with psychosis. Following the initial dose, three more doses could be given 4 h apart if needed during the 24-h period.; The mean BARS score had decreased 15 min after the first 20 mg IM dose and was statistically significantly lower than the 2 mg group at 30 min post-dose. The improvement with the 20 mg dose increased until 2 h, and was maintained until at least 4 h post-dose (P<0.001). Two hours after the first injection, almost all of the patients receiving ziprasidone 20 mg were BARS responders compared with just one-third of those receiving 2 mg ziprasidone (P<0.001). The calming effect of ziprasidone was also evident by the significant reduction in PANSS agitation items (P<0.05) and CGI-severity at 4 h (P=0.008). Both ziprasidone doses were very well tolerated. Ziprasidone IM 20 mg was not associated with EPS, dystonia, akathisia, respiratory depression or with excessive sedation.; Ziprasidone IM 20 mg substantially and significantly reduced the symptoms of acute agitation in patients with psychotic disorders. Ziprasidone 20 mg IM was very well tolerated and produced no dystonia or akathisia.",I,3

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of olanzapine and haloperidol on PRL secretion in male schizophrenic patients. Twenty-nine male schizophrenic inpatients were included in the study. Fifteen of them were given olanzapine in a fixed dose of 10 mg/day PO and 14 of them were given haloperidol in a fixed dose of 10 mg/day PO for 6 weeks after a 2-week drug washout period. Fifteen age-matched healthy control subjects were used as control group. PRL levels were measured both before and after the 6-week treatment period in the patients. At the end of the 6th week, the PRL values observed with olanzapine treatment were significantly less than those observed with haloperidol, but not different from those of the controls. There was a significant positive correlation between the PRL values and the severity of extrapyramidal side effects in only the haloperidol group after the six week's treatment period. Our data indicate that short-term olanzapine treatment at doses of 10 mg/day PO causes minimal elevations in PRL secretion in male schizophrenic patients in contrast to haloperidol. This finding is consistent with the previous reports and may be attributed to olanzapine's differential effects on dopamine neurotransmission.",2,E

This paper summarizes the consensus of a broad range of professionals after long-term commercialization in France of an atypical antipsychotic, amisulpride. Participants were from psychiatric hospitals, private clinics, out-patients settings and research; all were experienced with the drug. Discussions focused on the practical use of amisulpride, as, in addition to the double-blind trials information, it may be useful for psychiatrists of other countries to intuitively understand the therapeutic properties of amisulpride. The topics selected include acute psychotic episodes, short- and long-term follow-up, feasibility of treating the initial phase, the elderly and switching treatments. The French experience emphasizes the central role of amisulpride as a first-line treatment of schizophrenia.",5,E

Many risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia have been identified, the most important of which are previous suicide attempts, depression, hopelessness, substance abuse, and male gender. Insight into having a serious mental illness and less severe cognitive impairment are also associated with increased risk for suicide in schizophrenia, most likely when accompanied by feelings of hopelessness. Typical neuroleptic drugs have not been shown to reduce the risk of suicide. However, several types of evidence suggest that clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, appreciably reduces the suicide attempt and completion rates in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, perhaps by as much as 75-85%. Other atypical antipsychotic drugs may have a similar effect, but direct evidence is lacking. Improvement in positive and negative symptoms, reduced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), a direct antidepressant action, improved cognitive function, and improved compliance may contribute to reduced suicidality. The International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT) is a large prospective, randomized study intended to compare the effectiveness of clozapine with that of olanzapine in reducing suicide and suicide-related events in schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients. Some information about suicidality in the patient sample is reported here.",5,E

Faster onset is desirable to reduce the anguish caused by delusions and hallucinations and to protect patients and others from the consequences of poor judgment associated with psychotic exacerbation. Although sufficient studies have demonstrated that novel antipsychotics have advantages over clinically employed doses of classic drugs in terms of tolerability and aspects of efficacy, less is known about differences in speed of onset of therapeutic effect. This report consists of a post hoc subanalysis of data from a large double-blind, randomized pivotal trial in which we compared onset of therapeutic effect between risperidone and haloperidol.; During an 8-week period, 227 patients with DSM-III chronic schizophrenia received 4 mg/day of risperidone and 226 patients received 10 mg/day of haloperidol. Symptoms were assessed 6 times (days 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56) using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S). Data were analyzed using analysis of variance for multiple dependent variables and repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance.; The analyses revealed that patients receiving risperidone improved more rapidly than those receiving haloperidol as measured by PANSS total and CGI-S scores. Differences were most pronounced during the first week of treatment.; Results suggest that risperidone offers a more rapid response than haloperidol, particularly during the active phase of illness when time to response can be crucial.",I,I

Despite these concerns and the availability of mood stabilizing agents, the treatment of bipolar disorder with typical antipsychotic agents appears to be widespread.; A Medline search identified 16 publications that outlined medication use among 2378 bipolar disorder patients. Meta-analysis was used to estimate a weighted average of the relative proportions of the treatment use, where the weights were the reciprocals of the estimated variances for each study.; Overall, 84.7% of bipolar patients received typical antipsychotic agents, with a loading toward a greater in-patient (90.7%) relative to out-patient (65.3%) use. Monotherapy accounted for 53.8% of typical antipsychotic use, and typical antipsychotic/mood stabilizer combination therapy accounted for 47.4%. In four studies where length of treatment data were available, the median of minimum typical antipsychotic use was 2.5 months, with 96.0% of the patients receiving typical antipsychotic agents.; The meta-analytic technique employed in this analysis is limited by the possible inclusion of studies with unreliable study designs or biased treatment practices, publication bias in which some studies may not have been reported, and possible lack of identification of all relevant studies.; Typical antipsychotic agents are commonly used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, possibly due to dissatisfaction with mood stabilizer monotherapy especially in psychotic mania, the high prevalence of psychotic symptoms in acute mania, inappropriate continuation of typical antipsychotic agents after initial stabilization, and/or unavailability or unfamiliarity with new treatments. These findings also suggest that typical antipsychotics may have not only antipsychotic effects in mania but perhaps also antimanic properties.",5,E

Beyond efforts to maintain residual tissue or organ function, important physician roles include promoting general well-being and helping patients and their caregivers adjust to disease-related limitations. Physicians provide essential information to patients and their families about the disease, its social and legal ramifications, and community resources to facilitate care. Therefore, physicians must be knowledgeable about broadly intersecting medical, legal, financial, and ethical issues surrounding the long-term management of AD and other dementias. The many challenges faced by patients with dementia and their caregivers over time underscore the need for an ongoing diagnostic and therapeutic alliance with primary care physicians.

The reported causes of death, their frequency, prolongation of the rate corrected QT interval (QTc) and cardiac dysrhythmias in patients prescribed sertindole were compared with those for patients treated with two other atypical antipsychotics. All patients in England, prescribed atypical antipsychotics by general practitioners during each drug's immediate post-marketing period, were identified using an observational cohort technique, prescription-event monitoring. Mortality rates in the sertindole cohort were compared with those in a comparator cohort using standardized mortality ratios and incidence rate ratios. Cardiovascular events were reviewed and followed up to identify cases of prolongation of QTc interval. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality rates between sertindole and the comparator cohort, although confidence intervals (CI) were wide due to small numbers in the sertindole cohort. A much smaller number of patients were prescribed sertindole than the other antipsychotics. Six cases of prolongation of QTc interval were identified in 462 patients (1.3%, 95% CI 0.5-2.8) treated with sertindole and one with unspecified electrocardiogram changes in the comparator cohort of 16,542 patients. This study contributes to the understanding of the occurrence of prolongation of QTc interval during clinical use of sertindole, the incidence of which was similar to that in clinical trials.

RODOS consisted of retrospective chart reviews performed in patients who had been admitted to hospital and treated in 61 centres in nine countries. The analysed population consisted of 1901 patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The mean (SD) daily doses of risperidone and olanzapine were 5.3 (2.6) mg/day and 14.5 (5.1) mg/day, respectively. Patients treated with risperidone stayed an average of 3.8 days less in hospital compared to those receiving olanzapine (time to discharge was 43.6 days versus 47.4 days, respectively; P = 0.004). Risperidone was rated as effective in significantly more patients than olanzapine (84% versus 79%; P = 0.01). The time to onset of efficacy was significantly shorter with risperidone than with olanzapine (P < 0.001). The numbers of adverse events in the two treatment groups were not significantly different (13% risperidone, 11% olanzapine; P = 0.1). Correcting for small but statistically significant baseline differences between the two treatment groups did not produce a substantive change in the magnitude or significance of any outcome parameter. In conclusion, the clinical outcomes reported by RODOS suggest that risperidone may be more effective as a first-line therapy drug for schizophrenia than olanzapine.",2,E

The onset of action of the drug was about 2 weeks. Perospirone was effective against positive, negative and general symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, as assessed with standard rating scales (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Symptom Scale). Compared with haloperidol 2 to 12 mg/day, perospirone 8 to 48 mg/day was significantly more effective against negative symptoms and tended to be more effective against general symptoms and most positive symptoms in a trial in 145 patients with schizophrenia. Perospirone had efficacy similar to that of mosapramine 50 to 300 mg/day in a comparative phase III trial in 159 patients. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) tended to occur less often and were generally milder with perospirone than with haloperidol or mosapramine.",5,E

In order to find the electroencephalographic (EEG) parameters that reflect the effect of clozapine in schizophrenic patients, the authors applied various non-linear analyses on multi-channel EEG data drawn from patients before and after a therapeutic trial of clozapine. 2. The correlation dimension was difficult to extract from our limited time series EEG data and the authors did not find a meaningful association with clozapine use. The primary Lyapunov exponent could be reliably calculated but also did not reflect the effect of clozapine. 3. However, the mutual cross-prediction (MCP) algorithm showed potentially meaningful results. The driving system was shifted to the frontal channels after a 4-week trial with clozapine. Moreover, MCP might have a value as a predictor of treatment response. 4. Although preliminary in nature, the MCP might have greater power for interpreting complex changes from channel to channel in EEG induced by clozapine.",2,E

Sixty-two patients (29 depressed type; 33 bipolar type) entered a three-site, randomized, double-blind, 6-week trial of risperidone (up to 10 mg/day) or haloperidol (up to 20 mg/day). Trained raters assessed baseline, weekly, and end-of-study levels of psychopathology with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-24) and the Clinician-Administered Rating Scale for Mania (CARS-M). The authors were unable to statistically distinguish between risperidone and haloperidol in the amelioration of psychotic and manic symptoms. In addition, there was no difference in worsening of mania between the two agents in either subgroup (i.e., depressed or bipolar subgroups). For the total PANSS, risperidone produced a mean decrease of 16 points from baseline compared with a 14-point decrease with haloperidol. For the total CARS-M scale, risperidone and haloperidol produced mean change scores of 5 and 8 points, respectively, and for the CARS-M Mania subscale, 3 and 7 points, respectively. Additionally, risperidone produced a mean decrease of 13 points from the baseline 24-item HAM-D, compared with an 8-point decrease with haloperidol. In those patients who had more severe depressive symptoms (i.e., HAM-D baseline score >20), risperidone produced at least a 50% mean improvement in 12 (75%) of 16 patients in comparison to 8 (38%) of 21 patients receiving haloperidol. Haloperidol produced significantly more extrapyramidal side effects and resulted in more dropouts caused by any side effect. There was no difference between risperidone and haloperidol in reducing both psychotic and manic symptoms in this group of patients with schizoaffective disorder. Risperidone did not demonstrate a propensity to precipitate mania and was better tolerated than haloperidol. In those subjects with higher baseline HAM-D scores (i.e., >20), risperidone produced a greater improvement in depressive symptoms than haloperidol.",I,I

In this study, 201 agitated patients with bipolar mania were randomly assigned to receive one to three injections of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (10 mg, first two injections; 5 mg, third injection), the benzodiazepine lorazepam (2 mg, first two injections; 1 mg, third injection), or placebo (placebo, first two injections; olanzapine, 10 mg, third injection) within a 24-hour period. Agitation was measured at baseline, every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours, and at 24 hours after the first injection using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component subscale and two additional agitation scales. At 2 hours after the first injection, patients treated with olanzapine showed a significantly greater reduction in scores on all agitation scales compared with patients treated with either placebo or lorazepam. At 24 hours after the first injection, olanzapine remained statistically superior to placebo in reducing agitation in patients with acute mania, whereas patients treated with lorazepam were not significantly different from those treated with placebo or olanzapine. Furthermore, no significant differences among the three treatment groups were observed in safety measures, including treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms, the incidence of acute dystonia, or QTc interval changes. These findings suggest that intramuscular olanzapine is a safe and effective treatment for reducing acute agitation in patients with bipolar mania.",3,E

Polypharmacology is a necessary condition for the optimal treatment of many patients with comorbid psychiatric and medical illness. One concern raised by the widespread use of multiple concurrent pharmacotherapies is the potential for drug-drug interactions to adversely affect patient outcome. Accordingly, the biomedical literature was reviewed for reports of drug interactions involving risperidone, and the clinical significance of each report was evaluated. Additionally, the potential for risperidone to participate in drug interactions was evaluated by considering the drug's pharmacokinetic properties. Controlled studies and case reports indicate that risperidone has a low potential for metabolic drug interactions. Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 or induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may alter risperidone plasma concentrations, but the clinical significance of such interactions seems to be minimal. Adherence to a few guidelines for the design of dosage regimens should limit the effect of drug-drug interactions on patient status and contribute to optimal pharmacotherapy with risperidone.",5,E

This article presents an open-label, prospective, 14-week trial with olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder selected for unambiguous resistance to either clozapine or risperidone and to typical antipsychotics. Forty-three inpatients (mean age, 41.6 years; mean duration of illness, 21.7 years) were enrolled and treated after cross-titration from their previous antipsychotic treatment with olanzapine 10 to 40 mg daily without any concomitant antipsychotic medication. Patients were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impressions Scale, and the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. The change with olanzapine treatment was associated with a PANSS total score improvement of 3.7 (SD = 15.6; not significant). There was a significant improvement for the PANSS cognitive and depression/anxiety factors, whereas the PANSS excitement factor worsened. The improvement rate was superior in patients receiving olanzapine doses higher than 20 mg. A total of 16.7% of patients reached response criteria set forth by a previous study. There was a significant decrease in extrapyramidal side effects (t = 2.04; p < 0.05) and statistically significant, yet modest, weight gain. These results indicate that olanzapine is only modestly effective in these severely treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia. However, a trial with olanzapine can be recommended in these patients before moving to augmentation strategies, given the lack of proven alternatives and the observation that 16.7% of patients reached the response criteria.",I,4

The nature of this evidence, its implications, its shortcomings, and its effect upon the ethics of treating schizophrenia are elaborated and discussed. It is concluded that clinical psychiatry is currently in a state of ""equipoise"" or genuine uncertainty about the comparative merits of early treatment, a state which endorses early intervention research, including intervention in the prodromal phase.",5,E

The purpose of this naturalistic study was to determine the long-term effectiveness and tolerability of olanzapine as add-on therapy in psychotic mood disorders.; Hospital records were reviewed for 125 inpatients at the state psychiatric hospital in Buffalo, N.Y., who received at least 6 weeks of add-on olanzapine treatment for psychotic mood disorders (schizoaffective disorders [bipolar and depressive type], bipolar disorders [I, II, and NOS], and major depressive disorder). A group of schizophrenic patients served as a control group (N = 50). Baseline measures, including age, gender, number of hospitalizations in the 2 years prior to olanzapine treatment, concomitant medications, the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI), and the Global Assessment of Functioning-Equivalent (GAF-EQ) and Kennedy Axis V psychological impairment, violence, social skills, and activities of daily living subscale scores, were obtained. Follow-up information was obtained from the patients at least 6 months after initiation of olanzapine or by chart review and discussion with the treating psychiatrist. Patients with a diagnosis of psychotic mood disorders were compared with patients with the non-affective psychotic disorder (schizophrenia) on a variety of outcome measures.; Follow-up information was available on 102 patients (82%). Mean follow-up was 15 months; 50 (49%) of the 102 patients remained on olanzapine treatment at follow-up (32 psychotic mood disorder, 18 schizophrenic). The primary reason for discontinuation in both groups was lack of response. Both the psychotic mood disorder and schizophrenic groups had comparable outcomes on the CGI and GAF-EQ. Improvement on the Kennedy Axis V psychological impairment and social skills subscales was seen only in the psychotic mood disorders group (p < .01); both groups showed significant (p < .02) improvement in the violence subscale. Sustained mood-stabilizing effect was evident in only 7/27 (26%) of the psychotic mood disorders patients continuing on add-on olanzapine treatment at follow-up.; Lack of response was the primary reason for discontinuation of add-on olanzapine in both groups.

Depot use varied significantly with treatment site; African Americans were more likely to receive depot antipsychotics and less likely to receive atypical antipsychotics than white patients. Patients on depot and oral agents had similar levels of psychiatric symptoms, but patients on depot antipsychotics were more likely to receive high doses and complain of side effects.; Clinicians prescribed depot antipsychotics relatively infrequently, despite high rates of noncompliance and high levels of inpatient use. Variation in use with treatment site and ethnic group suggests barriers to implementing research-based recommendations for depot use in noncompliant patients.

The relationships of striatal D2 receptor occupancy with clinical efficacy and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were also assessed. Twenty-seven inpatients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder were included in a 4-week prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel and comparative clinical trial. Thirteen patients were treated with haloperidol (10 mg/day) and 14 with olanzapine (10 mg/day). Ratings of clinical status and EPS were obtained weekly. The percentage of D2 receptor occupancy was estimated by using basal ganglia (striatum)/frontal cortex IBZM uptake ratios obtained from each patient before and after 4 weeks of maintained antipsychotic treatment. Olanzapine led to a mean striatal D2 receptor occupancy of 49% (range 28-69%), which was significantly lower than that induced by haloperidol (mean 64%, range 46-90%). The baseline-endpoint SPECT design used in this study revealed lower antipsychotic D2 occupancy percentage values than those reported in the literature, using other approaches. The degree of striatal D2 receptor occupancy correlated to the EPS, which predominantly appeared in patients on haloperidol. No relationship was found between the striatal D2 receptor occupancy and clinical improvement. Olanzapine induced a lower striatal D2 occupancy than haloperidol. This low striatal D2 occupancy, together with the lower incidence of EPS in olanzapine-treated patients, contributed to confirm the atypical behavior of this new antipsychotic drug. Nevertheless, conclusions based on SPECT-estimated percentages of antipsychotic D2 occupancy should be cautious, since the SPECT design could influence the results. In this regard, SPECT studies including baseline and endpoint examinations should be encouraged.",2,E

Studies in molecular genetics, receptor binding, peripheral monoamines and pharmacological challenges have investigated the neurochemical basis of personality. Substantial evidence now exists to support a psychobiological model but the specificity of Cloninger's theory has not always been confirmed. Clinical studies have shown both temperament and character dimensions to improve with pharmacological treatment especially in treatment responders. Some personality changes are found to be independent of clinical effects and even to occur in normal subjects. Models of personality can help in predicting treatment outcome but individual dimensions may not be useful. It is hypothesised that social adaptation is related to the character dimensions and different sources of evidence link these to serotonergic actions. However, recent clinical studies have shown a specific effect of noradrenaline on self-perception and social motivation. Drugs with specific actions on different neurotransmitters may exert a distinctive pattern of effects on personality and social behaviour.",I,9

We estimated relative risks between risperidone and commonly used low-potency and high-potency APDs using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for age, gender, dose and other potential confounders.; In 4094 patients who had been newly prescribed antipsychotic drugs, the overall incidence rate of anticholinergic drug therapy was 556 per 1000 person-years, which was dose dependent. Prescribed doses of all antipsychotics were low. While, in accordance with previous trials, risperidone showed a lower risk of EPS than the high potency APDs such as haloperidol (RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.10-0.64), we did not observe a lower EPS rate than low-potency APDs (risperidone vs thioridazine RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.49-6.13; risperidone vs pipamperone RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.78-8.04).; The reduced EPS rates observed when comparing risperidone with high-potency antipsychotics such as haloperidol may not apply to comparisons with low-potency drugs.",I,2

Patients received risperidone (n = 1056) or other antipsychotics (n = 703). Haloperidol (n = 473) was the most frequently prescribed other antipsychotic. Efficacy assessments include the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, subscale (positive symptoms, negative symptoms and general psychopathology), cluster (cognitive and affective symptoms) and item (anxiety and hostility) scores. At endpoint, the mean decrease from baseline in PANSS total scores was significantly greater for patients receiving risperidone (-20.9) than other antipsychotics (-16.2; P < 0.001), or the subset receiving haloperidol (-14.3; P < 0.001). Risperidone-treated patients showed a significantly greater decrease in the positive (P < 0.01), negative (P < 0.05) and general psychopathology (P < 0.001) scores than patients receiving other antipsychotics or haloperidol. Scores for cognition, affective symptoms, anxiety and hostility each improved significantly (P < 0.05) more for patients receiving risperidone than those receiving other antipsychotics or haloperidol. Efficacy data on patients with an acute exacerbation were available from seven trials (risperidone n = 372, other antipsychotics n = 285, including haloperidol n = 120). At endpoint, the mean decrease from baseline in PANSS total scores was significantly greater for patients receiving risperidone (-24.7) than other antipsychotics (-19.8, P < 0.01) including haloperidol (-19.8, P < 0.05). Risperidone-treated patients also showed a greater decrease in positive symptom scores (-7.8) than those receiving other antipsychotics (-6.3; P < 0.01) or haloperidol (-7.1). A > or = 20% reduction in PANSS total score with risperidone, haloperidol and other antipsychotics was achieved by 65.9%, 54.3% and 54.9%, respectively; a > or = 30% PANSS reduction by 54.0%, 46.6% and 46.5% of patients, respectively; and a > or = 40% reduction by 43.8%, 33.7% and 34.4% of patients, respectively. These findings are consistent with earlier findings that show risperidone is more efficacious than haloperidol for reducing the symptoms of schizophrenia.",I,6

A total of 1864 patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder were identified from a large cohort of hospitalized patients. Patient characteristics were assessed at hospital admission and medication usage, at discharge. The medication analysis focused on the 1471 individuals with bipolar I mania or bipolar I depression (with or without psychotic features), representing 54% and 25% of admitted bipolar patients, respectively.; At admission, the typical bipolar patient (mean age 57) had experienced a relatively severe and chronic course of illness. The array of psychotropic agents used was broad, with no single prescribing pattern predominant. Only one in three bipolar I (manic or depressed) patients with psychotic features was discharged on medications recommended by expert guidelines as preferred or alternate recommended treatment. Absent psychotic features, this dropped to one in six patients. Surprising was the relatively high use of antidepressants for patients with mania, particularly those without psychotic symptoms.; Results suggest that a substantial proportion of patients with bipolar I disorder are discharged from hospitals on medications not generally recommended by current practice guidelines.",5,E

Risperidone, in general, is well tolerated when administered as monotherapy, but has been linked to a persistent elevation of serum prolactin and associated symptoms. The goal of this study was to determine whether the addition of risperidone to clozapine results in an elevation of serum prolactin levels in patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.; Twenty patients on clozapine-risperidone combination therapy were matched for age and gender with 20 patients treated with clozapine monotherapy. Demographic information was gathered along with clozapine and risperidone dose and the length of time on risperidone. Serum prolactin levels were measured from a single blood sample.; The 2 groups did not differ in age, race, gender, diagnosis, age at clozapine initiation, age at onset, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores, or clozapine dose. The mean +/- SD serum prolactin level was 8.42+/-4.17 ng/mL for clozapine monotherapy patients and 35.76+/-17.43 ng/mL for combination therapy patients. The 2 medication categories showed a significant difference in log prolactin values (t = -7.97, df = 38, p < or = .0001). Sixteen combination therapy patients (80%) exhibited elevated prolactin levels (range for entire group, 9.7-69.8 ng/mL) while only 2 clozapine monotherapy patients (10%) exhibited prolactin elevation levels (range for entire group, 2.4-20.2 ng/mL; df = 1, p < .0001).; The combination of risperidone and clozapine appears to result in a moderate elevation of serum prolactin levels.

This study examined its efficacy in partially responsive, community-based patients, compared clozapine with moderate-dose haloperidol, and extended treatment to 6 months.; Randomized, double-blind, 29-week trial comparing clozapine (n = 37) with haloperidol (n = 34). Subjects with schizophrenia who were being treated in community settings at 3 collaborating clinical facilities were enrolled.; Subjects treated with haloperidol were significantly more likely to discontinue treatment for lack of efficacy (51%) than were those treated with clozapine (12%). A higher proportion of clozapine-treated subjects met an a priori criterion of improvement (57%) compared with haloperidol-treated subjects (25%). Significantly greater improvement was seen in symptoms of psychosis, hostile-suspiciousness, anxiety-depression, thought disturbance, and total score measured on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. No differences were detected in negative symptoms using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale or the Schedule for Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Subjects treated with clozapine experienced more excess salivation, dizziness, and sweating and less dry mouth and decreased appetite than those treated with haloperidol.; Compared with a first-generation antipsychotic given in a moderate dose, clozapine offers substantial clinical benefits to treatment-refractory subjects who can be treated in the community.

Sequential assessments were conducted throughout the study.; Forty-four patients (51.2%) fulfilled McElroy's criteria for dysphoric mania. Fourteen of these dysphoric patients were treated with olanzapine in combination with mood-stabilizers. All patients improved in manic symptoms but patients treated with olanzapine improved significantly more than those treated with other antipsychotics in depressive symptoms.; The lack of randomization is a methodological limitation of this study, so these findings should be considered as preliminary.; Dysphoric symptoms are common in this population of manic patients. Olanzapine in combination with mood-stabilizers may be effective in these patients. Additional controlled studies are needed to replicate these results.",6,E

The older antidepressants and antipsychotics do not seem to be effective and often cause many adverse effects. Therefore, we wanted to try the new psychotropic drugs in Finnish patients with JNCL. We also wanted to determine the profile of these drugs in this patient group. Fourteen Finnish patients with JNCL receiving psychotropic drug treatment with citalopram, risperidone, olanzapine or quetiapine, were included. The mean age at initiation of the new psychotropic drugs was 13.8 years. Indications for treatment were psychotic symptoms, affective symptoms, anxiety and an inadequate response to other psychotropic drugs, or even adverse reactions. Information on psychiatric symptoms and current treatment was gathered from interviews and from the medical records. Indications and the clinical outcome of the treatment were determined by a consensus of the assessments by parents and physicians. The psychotropic drugs most commonly used in Finnish patients with JNCL are citalopram and risperidone. The clinical outcome was good or satisfactory in 70%. The adverse effects most commonly reported were fatigue, weight gain and aggravation of extrapyramidal symptoms. Little research has been done in this area and there are no good guidelines for treatment of psychiatric symptoms in patients with JNCL. Therefore, every patient should be treated with the safest and most commonly used drugs in the lowest possible doses.",4,E

All of them had experienced frequent relapses, residual subsyndromal symptoms, and inadequate responses to other drugs, such as lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine. While maintaining other drugs, they all received open-label, increasing doses of olanzapine, until achieving clinical response. Other drugs were maintained. The patients were assessed several consecutive times from baseline to the endpoint with the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale for use in bipolar illness. Records of recurrences, hospitalizations, and side effects were also collected.

Clinical symptomatology, based on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms ratings, markedly improved after treatment with both haloperidol and clozapine. The beneficial effects of clozapine were statistically significantly greater than the effects from the haloperidol treatment. Regarding neurocognition, both agents proved efficacious in improving performance on nearly all measures compared with placebo. In addition, as compared with haloperidol, clozapine significantly improved performance on Trails B, Verbal Fluency, and measures of delayed verbal memory, and it tended to increase performance on most measures. Additional analyses indicated that the improvement on neurocognitive measures was not because of symptom amelioration; rather, neurocognitive deficits seem to be an intrinsic enduring feature of schizophrenia.

Antipsychotic agents are the mainstay of treatment but response is often inadequate. Negative symptoms (disturbances in volition, social interaction and affective functions) are particularly difficult to treat and form a major obstacle to rehabilitation. A promising approach to improve response of negative symptoms has been to add a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant to antipsychotic treatment. This review examines evidence pertaining to the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the SSRI fluvoxamine, combined with antipsychotic agents, in the treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Important methodological issues, such as differentiating primary and secondary negative symptoms, are discussed. The balance of available evidence indicates that fluvoxamine can improve primary negative symptoms in chronic schizophrenia patients treated with typical antipsychotics and suggests that it may also do so in some patients treated with clozapine. This combination is generally safe and well tolerated although, as antipsychotic drug concentrations may be elevated, attention to dose and drug monitoring should be considered appropriately. Combination with clozapine may require particular caution because of potential toxicity if serum clozapine levels rise steeply. The fluvoxamine doses effective in augmentation are lower than those usually used to treat depression. Evidence regarding the use of fluvoxamine augmentation to treat phenomena, such as obsessions and aggression, which may be associated with schizophrenia, is also examined. An important goal of future studies will be to define which patient groups can benefit from combined treatment.",5,E

Clozapine is a dibenzodiazepine neuroleptic which presents the advantage of not having undesirable neurological side-effects. Its efficacy for the treatment of the symptoms of schizophrenia is known, but the use of clozapine is limited to treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients as it induces agranulocytosis with a higher incidence than that of other neuroleptic drugs. 2. The present study was designed in order to evaluate the benefit/risk of chronic treatment. The analysis was performed using the files of schizophrenic patients. These patients were not stabilized by a classical neuroleptic treatment and/or presented individual secondary effects. 3. Clozapine induced neutropenia and 1 case of agranulocytosis in 3 females. Analysis of leukocyte expression highlighted some premonitory symptoms in patients who presented neutropenia. The observation of 2 to 3 early successive peaks in leukocyte expression (between the third and tenth week of treatment) could be predictive of neutropenia in the 3 to 4 months of treatment. 4. The patients who presented a lower leukocyte base-line following a peak had a higher risk, of developing neutropenia. This might explain some late accidents beyond the first six months of treatment. 5. The present study confirmed the advantages of clozapine treatment and demonstrated that the risk of neutropenia may be diminished by the detection of premonitory symptoms and the early monitoring of patients at risk i.e. female patients and subjects with a lower leukocyte base-line.",I,4

Patients were evaluated with psychopathology rating scales and a battery of neuropsychological tests at baseline, end of double-blind and end of open-label phases of the study. At the end of the double-blind phase there were no significant differences between olanzapine and haloperidol, except for a trend for improvement on the Wisconsin Card Sort Test on olanzapine, which was significant at traditional but not corrected significance levels. After an additional 3 months of treatment with olanzapine doses of 20-40 mg/d, our statistical analysis showed significant improvement on overall neuropsychological test performance and specific cognitive tasks assessing verbal memory. However, these open-label results are difficult to interpret definitively because of the lack of a comparison drug group and the olanzapine dose escalation over time. Neurocognitive changes were not correlated with changes in psychopathology as assessed by PANSS or SANS scores.",4,E

The trial was divided into two periods: eight weeks during which the dosage was escalated and then fixed, and six weeks during which variable dosages were used. The hostility item of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was the principal outcome measure. Covariates included the items that reflect positive symptoms of schizophrenia (delusions, suspiciousness or feelings of persecution, grandiosity, unusual thought content, conceptual disorganization, and hallucinations) and the sedation item of the Nurses Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE).; Patients differed in their treatment response as measured by the hostility item of the PANSS. The scores of patients taking clozapine indicated significantly greater improvement than those of patients taking haloperidol or risperidone. The effect on hostility appeared to be independent of the antipsychotic effect of clozapine on other PANSS items that reflect delusional thinking, a formal thought disorder, or hallucinations and independent of sedation as measured by the NOSIE. Neither risperidone nor olanzapine showed superiority to haloperidol.; Clozapine has a relative advantage over other antipsychotics as a specific antihostility agent.",I,4

They review the evidence linking QTc interval prolongation, potassium channels, and torsade de pointes from both the long QT syndrome and drugs. They examine the risk for torsade de pointes from antipsychotic drugs and estimate the frequency of sudden death on the basis of epidemiological data in normal and schizophrenic populations.; All drugs that cause torsade de pointes prolong the QTc interval and bind to the potassium rectifier channel, but the relationships are not precise. Prediction of torsade de pointes and sudden death can be improved by examining dose dependency, the percent of QTc intervals higher than 500 msec, and the risk of drug-drug interactions. Although sudden unexpected death occurs almost twice as often in populations treated with antipsychotics as in normal populations, there are still only 10-15 such events in 10,000 person-years of observation.; Although pimozide, sertindole, droperidol, and haloperidol have been documented to cause torsade de pointes and sudden death, the most marked risk is with thioridazine. There is no association with olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone. Ziprasidone does prolong the QT interval, but there is no evidence to suggest that this leads to torsade de pointes or sudden death. Only widespread use will prove if ziprasidone is entirely safe. To date, all antipsychotic drugs have the potential for serious adverse events. Balancing these risks with the positive effects of treatment poses a challenge for psychiatry.",I,8

Participants initially entered a 24-week, double-blind crossover trial in which fluphenazine and placebo were administered for 12 weeks each. For those who did not experience symptom exacerbation or relapse during this period, fluphenazine was openly withdrawn; participants were then followed for up to 18 additional months.; When a low threshold for defining symptom reemergence was used, 78% (N=39 of 50) of the patients experienced an exacerbation or relapse within 1 year; 96% (N=48 of 50) did so within 2 years. Mean time to exacerbation or relapse was 235 days. When hospitalization was used as a relapse criterion, only six of 45 of individuals (13%) experiencing an exacerbation or relapse who continued in treatment in the clinic were hospitalized, demonstrating the sensitivity of the psychotic exacerbation criterion.; The vast majority of clinically stable individuals with recent-onset schizophrenia will experience an exacerbation or relapse after antipsychotic discontinuation, even after more than a year of maintenance medication. However, clinical monitoring and a low threshold for reinstating medications can prevent hospitalization for the majority of these patients.",I,3

11700151,Olanzapine: a review of its use in the treatment of bipolar I disorder.,Animals; Benzodiazepines; Bipolar Disorder; Humans; Pirenzepine; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors,"Bhana, N; Perry, C M","Olanzapine, a thienobenzodiazepine derivative, is a psychotropic agent that has shown efficacy in the treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder. Olanzapine has a multireceptorial binding profile including a greater affinity for serotonin 5-HT(2A) than for dopamine D(2) receptors. Olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day demonstrated significantly greater antimanic efficacy than placebo in two double-blind, randomised 3- or 4-week trials of patients with bipolar I disorder of either manic or mixed episodes, with or without psychotic features. Additionally, in one of these trials, improvements in cognitive function and hostility were superior with olanzapine. In cohorts of severely depressed and rapid cycling patients, improvements in manic and depressive symptoms and in manic symptoms only, were superior with olanzapine compared with placebo. Significant improvements from baseline in symptoms of mania, depression, cognitive functioning and hostility were seen with olanzapine in a 49-week extension phase study. In double-blind trials, olanzapine 10 mg/day appeared to have similar antimanic efficacy to oral lithium 400mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with pure mania (4-week small study). In patients with acute manic or mixed episodes olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day appeared to be more effective than oral valproate semisodium (divalproex sodium) 500 to 2500 mg/day (3-week study) and at least as effective as oral haloperidol 3 to 15 mg/day (12-week study). Preliminary results from a large 6-week placebo-controlled study suggest that olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day in combination with mood stabilisers (lithium or valproate semisodium) provides effective augmentation of antimanic treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder, with benefits seen in the first week. Adverse events reported significantly more often with olanzapine than with placebo were somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness and bodyweight gain, and in comparison with valproate semisodium were somnolence, dry mouth, increased appetite and bodyweight gain. Olanzapine was generally well tolerated with no clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory tests, vital signs or electrocardiogram results.; Olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy compared with placebo in the short-term treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes, with or without psychotic features, and was generally well tolerated. According to preliminary data the antimanic efficacy of olanzapine appears similar to that of haloperidol and better than that of valproate semisodium in patients with bipolar I disorder experiencing a manic or mixed episode; among nonpsychotic patients with manic or mixed episodes olanzapine appears to be superior to haloperidol. Available data support the choice of olanzapine as an option in the short-term management of mania in patients with bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes, with or without psychotic features.",I,5

To test the hypothesis that 5-HT(1A) receptor responsivity is significantly different in patients with SCH compared to normal control subjects, the neuroendocrine study was performed using ipsapirone (IPS), a 5-HT(1A) partial agonist, as a probe.; Ipsapirone 0.5 mg/kg, p.o. or placebo were administered, in random order, to patients with SCH (n = 43; 32 male) and normal controls (n = 33; 21 male). Blood samples for plasma cortisol and body temperature were obtained from 30 min before to 180 min after administration of IPS or placebo.; Female normal control subjects had markedly greater increases in plasma cortisol following IPS than did male control subjects. The placebo response-corrected plasma cortisol response to IPS was significantly blunted in female SCH compared to female normal control subjects (p =.0001). The IPS-stimulated plasma cortisol response in male SCH did not differ from that of male normal control subjects or female SCH. There were no significant differences in the IPS-induced hypothermia in men and women or between patients with SCH and normal control subjects. Behavioral responses to IPS, including nausea, dizziness, irritability, and feeling less well, did not differ between groups.; These results suggest that the post-synaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor mediated endocrine response is diminished in female SCH compared to female normal control subjects, possibly secondary to an abnormality in intracellular signal transduction mechanism.",3,E

After treatment of DKA and discontinuation of clozapine, glucose tolerance and concurrent serum insulin concentrations reverted to normal as measured by two OGTT performed 60 and 320 days after resolution of DKA.; Antiislet-cell antibodies, antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, and human insulin antibody were negative on two separate occasions. Euglycemic clamp study demonstrated insulin resistance manifested by a glucose disposal rate of approximately 55% of mean normal values. IVGTT demonstrated a low rate of glucose disappearance (KG = 0.95) and diminished first-phase insulin response when OGTT was normal, indicating impairment in insulin sensitivity and reduction in beta cell function 323 days after discontinuance of clozapine. This adverse reaction is considered probable according to the Naranjo probability scale.; The occurrence of cases of DKA and new or worsening diabetes mellitus in patients using clozapine suggests a causal relationship. We hypothesize that the mechanism by which clozapine may produce glucose intolerance may require a preexisting latent defect in insulin secretion and insulin action. With the administration of clozapine, some of these patients may develop worsening insulin resistance and may fail to mount an appropriate compensatory beta cell insulin secretion for the degree of insulin resistance. As a consequence, hyperglycemia develops and its persistence results in glucose toxicity, further suppressing beta cell insulin secretion. Such combined defects in insulin secretion and sensitivity are known to be synergistic, leading to the development of abnormal glucose tolerance, which can be clinically manifested as a spectrum ranging from impaired glucose tolerance through severe hyperglycemia to DKA. Patients being started on clozapine should be carefully followed for the development or worsening of diabetes mellitus, regardless of the dose of the drug.",2,E

Aims of the present study were to elucidate the comparative efficacy of prodrome-based neuroleptic intervention in first vs multiple episode (ME) schizophrenia. As to the methods, three randomly assigned open neuroleptic treatment strategies were compared over 2 years in 363 schizophrenic outpatients (115 FE, 248 ME; ICD-9, RDC): maintenance medication vs two intermittent medication strategies (prodrome-based intervention and crisis intervention). Concerning relapse prevention, the results demonstrate that ME patients seemed to profit most from maintenance medication compared to both intermittent treatments, whereas FE patients did equally well under maintenance medication and prodrome-based intervention treatment. Psychopathology, social adjustment, subjective well-being, and side-effects after two years did not differ significantly between the FE and ME patients irrespective of treatment strategy. Concerning treatment adherence, FE patients complied better with prodrome-based intervention than with maintenance medication. Cumulative neuroleptic dosage was lowest in FE patients under intermittent treatment. In conclusion, maintenance medication is the best strategy for relapse prevention in ME patients. In FE patients, prodrome-based intermittent intervention seems to be equivalent or even better with respect to compliance and dosage applied.",3,E

At low doses, it enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission by preferentially blocking presynaptic dopamine D2/D3 autoreceptors. At higher doses, amisupride antagonises postsynaptic dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, preferentially in the limbic system rather than the striatum, thereby reducing dopaminergic transmission. In patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia, the recommended dosage of amisulpride is 400 to 800 mg/day, although dosages < or =1200 mg/day may be administered. In comparative trials, amisulpride administered within this range (400 to 1200 mg/day) was as effective as haloperidol 5 to 40 mg/day, flupenthixol 25 mg/day and risperidone 8 mg/day in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia with predominantly positive symptoms. Amisulpride was more effective than haloperidol but equally effective as risperidone in controlling negative symptoms. Amisulpride 400 to 800 mg/day was more effective than haloperidol, risperidone and flupenthixol in controlling affective symptoms in these patients. In randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia, amisulpride 50 to 300 mg/day was more effective than placebo. Amisulpride is effective as maintenance therapy in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Long-term treatment with amisulpride was associated with improvements in quality of life and social functioning. Amisulpride is generally well tolerated. In well-controlled trials, the neurological tolerability profile (including ratings on extrapyramidal symptom scales) of amisulpride 400 to 1200 mg/day was superior to that of the conventional antipsychotics (haloperidol or flupenthixol), but was similar to that of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. At low dosages of amisulpride (< or =300 mg/day), the incidence of adverse events (including extrapyramidal symptoms) reported with amisulpride was similar to that with placebo.; In comparative trials, amisulpride 400 to 1200 mg/day showed efficacy in reducing overall symptomatology and positive symptoms similar to that of conventional antipsychotics and newer atypical antipsychotics in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. Moreover, its effective alleviation of negative and affective symptoms, its lower association with extrapyramidal symptoms and loss of cognitive function than conventional antipsychotics and its long-term efficacy justifies consideration of the use of higher dosages of amisulpride in this group of patients. Consequently, the dosage of amisulpride that is recommended in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia is 400 to 800 mg/day, although dosages < or =1200 mg/day may be administered. Lower dosages of amisulpride (50 to 300 mg/day) should be considered for the management of patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Amisulpride is a first-line treatment option in the management of schizophrenia in the acute phase and for the maintenance of treatment response.",5,E

Logistic regression was used to compare incidence rates adjusting for age, sex, and duration of available follow-up.; No significant differences in overall incidence rates for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or hypertension were observed in patients receiving clozapine vs conventional antipsychotics.

This finding requires confirmation in other settings and patient populations and with the other atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine fumarate).

In the present study, arithmetic abilities and working memory functions were investigated in schizophrenic patients (n=24) and healthy control subjects (n=24). Arithmetic fact retrieval was assessed in single-digit multiplication and corresponding division problems using a result verification task which minimized working memory demands. Problem size and the disparity of the proposed result were manipulated. The storage component of working memory was tested with a digit span forward task and the executive control component with a digit span backward as well as with verbal fluency tasks. Schizophrenic patients performed worse than controls only in the executive tasks. Digit span forward was preserved. In the arithmetic tasks, groups did not differ from each other, and a similar pattern of task manipulations was obtained. Hence, despite the executive control deficit retrieval of arithmetic facts is preserved in schizophrenia. Moreover, the same underlying cognitive processes as in control subjects are involved.",I,2

The current study compared the effects of quetiapine and haloperidol on measures of executive function, memory and attention. Subjects were 58 stable outpatients with schizophrenia (DSM III-R) who received a battery of cognitive tests as part of a randomized, double-blind, multi-site clinical efficacy study conducted by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals. Cognitive assessments were conducted prior to randomization when patients were receiving < or =30 mg haloperidol or equivalent (mean: 9.2mg/day haloperidol equivalents), and again after 24 weeks of fixed-dose treatment with either quetiapine 600 or 300 mg/day or haloperidol 12 mg/day. Analyses of covariance with planned comparisons were used to compare scores on cognitive measures at the end of 24 weeks by treatment group with baseline cognitive function scores used as covariates. Patients receiving quetiapine 600 mg/day improved to a greater extent than patients receiving haloperidol on overall cognitive function (p<0.02). Specific differences were found for executive function (Verbal Fluency Test, p<0.04), attention (Stroop Color Word Test, p<.03) and verbal memory (Paragraph Recall Test, p<0.02). Treatment group differences were not solely due to benztropine use, medication side effects, or changes in symptomatology. Treatment with quetiapine at higher doses (600 mg/day) relative to haloperidol appears to have a positive impact on important domains of cognitive performance that have been found to predict role function and community outcomes in patients with schizophrenia.",I,I

An economic analysis of clozapine consisted of a meta-analysis and a cost-utility analysis. Clozapine was compared with haloperidol and chlorpromazine. An incidence-based deterministic decision analysis was used to model the management of chronic schizophrenia over one year. Probabilities of clinical outcomes were obtained from a random effects, single arm meta-analysis. Utility weights were evaluated in a cohort of patients by using a standard gamble methodology. A government payer perspective was adopted for this analysis. Clozapine was the dominant therapy in this analysis because it was associated with the lowest overall expected cost and highest expected number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Compared with chlorpromazine, clozapine might save $38,879/year while producing 0.04 more QALYs. This analysis was limited in that studies were of short duration, the sample size for health utility analysis was small and the analysis was based on a model. Clozapine appears to be a very cost effective therapy in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia compared with haloperidol and chlorpromazine.",5,E

Several published reports of diabetes mellitus occurring with clozapine therapy have appeared during the past 5 years. Because the risk and characteristics of clozapine-associated diabetes mellitus remain unclear, we conducted a descriptive epidemiologic study of spontaneous adverse event reports of hyperglycemia occurring in clozapine-treated patients. The Food and Drug Administration MedWatch surveillance program was queried (January 1990 through February 2001), and the results were pooled with published cases. Parameters assessed included documentation of diabetes, clinical severity, new-onset diabetes versus exacerbation of preexisting disease, demographic characteristics of patients, time to onset of hyperglycemia, and effect of drug discontinuation and rechallenge. We identified 384 reports. Of these, new-onset diabetes was diagnosed definitively in 242 patients, and 54 patients had exacerbation of preexisting disease. The mean (+/- SD) age was 40 +/- 12 years (range, 13 to 77). The male:female ratio was 2:0. Most cases appeared within 6 months of initiating clozapine therapy. One patient developed diabetes following a single 500-mg dose. There were 80 cases of metabolic acidosis or ketosis. Twenty-five patients died during hyperglycemic episodes. Forty-six patients had improved glycemic control after discontinuation or dose reduction of the drug.A causal relationship between clozapine and diabetes is suggested by the number of reports, the temporal relation to clozapine initiation, the relatively young age of the affected patients, and the prompt reversibility on withdrawal of the drug in some patients. The severity of reported cases ranged from mild glucose intolerance to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma.",I,6

They were randomly assigned to receive flexible doses (0.5 to 2 mg/day) of haloperidol or risperidone. Clinical response was evaluated using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), Simpson-Angus Scale, Functional Assessment Staging and Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination.; The mean doses at the last week were 0.90 mg/day of haloperidol and 0.85 mg/day of risperidone. Both haloperidol and risperidone significantly reduced the severity of BPSD (scores on CMAI and BEHAVE-AD), with no significant between-group differences. Haloperidol-treated patients showed a worsening on Simpson-Angus scale while there was no significant change in this measure in risperidone-treated patients.; Low-dose haloperidol and risperidone were well tolerated and associated with reductions in the severity and frequency of behavioural symptoms in subjects with dementia.

Furthermore, aspects of the longitudinal course of the illness, like rapid cycling (RC), are reflected as well. Rapid cycling is defined as four or more affective episodes within one year of the illness. It has been postulated that rapid cycling is related with a poor response to lithium, to the same extent as mixed episodes or an atypical onset (depressive episode first) of the disease. Here, the current status of alternative pharmacological and supportive therapy of rapid cycling is presented and discussed.

Besides blocking dopamine, atypical antipsychotics also block 5-HT receptors. The clinical efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine is associated with the 5-HT antagonistic action of the drug and a high serotonergic tone before treatment. The atypical antipsychotic olanzapine has a receptor-binding profile similar to that of clozapine. The present study investigated whether treatment with olanzapine blocks hormone release induced by the 5-HT2c agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) and, if so, whether this 5-HT antagonistic effect is related to treatment response. Eighteen male schizophrenic patients participated in this study. All patients were challenged with m-CPP (0.5 mg/kg orally) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design after a drug-free period of at least 2 weeks. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and prolactin plasma levels were measured every 30 minutes up to 210 minutes after challenge. Patients were treated for 6 weeks with 10 mg olanzapine daily in an open design, after which the challenge tests were repeated. Olanzapine significantly blocked m-CPP-induced ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin release, suggesting that it is a potent 5-HT2c antagonist in vivo. This 5-HT antagonistic effect of olanzapine was not significantly correlated with treatment response. Also, no significant correlation was found between m-CPP-induced hormone release before treatment and clinical response after treatment with olanzapine. These findings suggest that olanzapine is a potent 5-HT2c antagonist in vivo but that this is unrelated to its clinical efficacy in this nonrefractory sample of schizophrenic patients.",2,E

Twenty patients with clozapine-induced hypersalivation underwent a random-order, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial which lasted 8 weeks each for the pirenzepine and placebo investigations, with a 4-week washout period in between. The severity of hypersalivation was assessed using an objective measure: saliva production monitored through the diameter of wetted surface on tissue paper placed over the patient's pillow. Our study showed that pirenzepine had no significant therapeutic effect on hypersalivation compared with placebo, suggesting that hypersalivation induced by clozapine might have a neurobiological basis other than the M4-muscarinic receptor.",3,E

Patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive quetiapine or risperidone. Doses were adjusted to maximize efficacy and to minimize adverse events. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were assessed with an EPS checklist; adverse events were recorded. Efficacy was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D).; A total of 728 patients were randomized, 553 to quetiapine and 175 to risperidone. Mean prescribed doses over the study period were 253.9 mg/d quetiapine and 4.4 mg/d risperidone. At the end of 4 months, EPS declined in both treatment groups, but quetiapine-treated patients were significantly less likely to require dose adjustment or concurrent anti-EPS medication (P < 0.001). The most common adverse events in the quetiapine and risperidone groups were somnolence (31.3% and 15.4%, respectively), dry mouth (14.5% and 6.9%), and dizziness (12.7% and 6.9%). Overall, tolerance to side effects with the 2 drugs, measured by dropout rates, was comparable. At each visit, a higher percentage of quetiapine-treated patients showed improvement on the CGI scale, but there were no significant between-group differences on the PANSS. At end point, quetiapine-treated patients had significantly lower HAM-D scores (P = 0.028).; The results of this study suggest that quetiapine is as effective as risperidone for the treatment of psychotic symptoms, is more effective for depressive symptoms, may have a more favorable EPS profile, and has comparable overall tolerability.",I,I

Convergent validity and divergent validity were assessed with baseline data from Studies 1 and 2 in subjects with acute agitation. To investigate convergent validity, we sought Pearson and Spearman correlation of BARS scores with scores on the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) Scale and a predefined cluster of agitation-related items from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). For divergent validity, we sought Pearson and Spearman correlation between BARS scores and a predefined cluster of PANSS items measuring negative symptoms. Discriminant validity was investigated with the help of subjects with moderate psychopathology (Study 3). Wilcoxon rank-sum and two-sample t tests determined whether mean (or median) BARS scores differed between subjects with acute agitation (Studies 1 and 2) and moderate psychopathology (Study 3).

Patients were subdivided according to prior use of antipsychotic and antiparkinsonian drugs.; We identified 424 patients starting treatment with haloperidol, 243 with risperidone, and 181 with olanzapine. Prior use of antipsychotic plus antiparkinsonian medication was significantly more frequent among users of risperidone and olanzapine than in those using haloperidol (36.2%, 40.3%, and 4.5%, respectively; p < 0.001). Within most subgroups of comparable treatment history, patients using risperidone and olanzapine showed reduced risks of EPS compared with haloperidol, although some of these findings did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.03-0.22). However, this was not observed for patients using risperidone who had experienced EPS in the past (RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.24 to 7.18).; In general, we observed reduced risks of EPS for risperidone and olanzapine compared with haloperidol within subgroups of patients with a similar treatment history. However, the added value of risperidone in patients who have experienced EPS in the past needs further study.",I,2

Twenty-four patients were randomly assigned to treatment with risperidone in doses of 0.5 to 6.0 mg/day, and 24 were assigned to placebo. The dosage of medication was increased in fixed increments during the first week of double-blind treatment and thereafter in a flexible dose regimen according to clinical response. Risperidone, at a median dose of 2.5 mg/day (range, 1 to 6 mg/day), was found to be significantly ( p < 0.05) superior to placebo on the Global Severity Rating of the Tourette Syndrome Severity Scale. The proportion of patients who improved by at least one point on this seven-point scale was 60.8% in the risperidone group and 26.1% in the placebo group. Treatment with risperidone was accompanied by an improvement in global functioning in patients with average to above-average impairment at baseline as measured by the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. With respect to extrapyramidal symptom scores measured on the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, hypokinesia and tremor increased in the risperidone group, but the effect on tremor was largely confined to subjects with higher baseline tremor scores. There were no significant differences in dystonic reactions, dyskinetic movements, subjective parkinsonism, or akathisia. Risperidone did not increase obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

The aim of this study was to investigate further the role of sedation using the Remember-Know procedure and a physiological measure of sedation based on pupillography in addition to standard measures of sedation and attention (digit-symbol substitution task, symbol cancellation task, self-rated sedation). Twelve subjects were tested after the intake of placebo, lorazepam 0.026 mg/kg and lorazepam 0.038 mg/kg, administered in a randomized order, with a minimum interval of 8 days between each administration. On a recognition memory task, they were asked to give 'Remember', 'Know' or 'Guess' responses to items that were recognized on the basis of conscious recollection, familiarity, or guessing, respectively. Lorazepam selectively impaired recognition based on 'Remember' responses. This impairment was greater in the lorazepam 0.038 mg/kg than in the lorazepam 0.026 mg/kg groups. Measures of sedation were not correlated with the proportion of 'Remember' responses. These results suggest that sedation alone cannot account for the impairment of conscious recollection induced by lorazepam.",5,E

Amisulpride improved positive symptoms consistently, and changes were more pronounced than with haloperidol, flupenthixol and risperidone; amisulpride showed a more rapid onset of action compared to haloperidol, and improvement in negative symptoms was more effective than with any comparator. An optimum response was obtained with amisulpride doses 400-800 mg/day. The long-term study confirmed the usefulness of amisulpride for maintenance treatment in schizophrenia, with a clear advantage over haloperidol, leading to better functioning and quality of life.

Not only is this distressing for the patients and their family and friends, but it also results in high indirect costs. Reintegration back into society, one of the most important aspects of quality life for schizophrenic patients and their physicians, must therefore take into account a patient's social functioning and employability, as well as improvement in symptoms. Although the typical antipsychotics are effective in managing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, they may not alleviate other aspects of the disorder. They are also associated with extrapyramidal symptoms and other severe adverse events that have significant consequences for quality of life and compliance. The atypical antipsychotic, amisulpride, has an improved safety and tolerability profile and has been shown to be significantly more effective than placebo and haloperidol on a number of quality of life and social functioning scales, including the Global Assessment of Functioning, the Quality of Life Scale, the Functional Status Questionnaire and the Psychosocial Aptitude Rating Scale. In conclusion, amisulpride, in addition to its proven clinical efficacy, may help reintegration of the schizophrenic patient back into society.",5,E

In this study, melperone was administered, in an open trial design of 6 weeks' duration, to 44 patients with chronic neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenia. The Global Assessment Scale (GAS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and measures of extrapyramidal symptoms and other clinical variables were assessed at baseline and 6 weeks. Thirty-seven patients completed the 6-week trial. Melperone significantly improved overall psychiatric status as measured by GAS score for all evaluable subjects [last value carried forward (LVCF) and a completers analysis]. No significant effects on BPRS measures of psychopathology scores were found in the LVCF or completers analysis.

Olanzapine induced a response at a rate equal to that induced by haloperidol in the first few weeks, but by the end of the study produced a greater percentage of responders. Compared with haloperidol, olanzapine produced a somewhat greater response on symptoms responsive to haloperidol, but a markedly better response on symptoms unresponsive to haloperidol. This difference favoring olanzapine occurred to an equal degree in all subgroups examined. The incidence of parkinsonism or akathisia following olanzapine treatment was extremely low and not statistically distinguishable from placebo.; Olanzapine produced a greater improvement than haloperidol particularly by benefiting a much larger number of items or factors.

The purpose of this article was to compare the atypical profile of amisulpride with that of the 5-HT(2)/D(2) antagonists.; Randomized controlled trials that compared amisulpride with conventional antipsychotics or placebo for patients with schizophrenia were identified and included in a meta-analysis. The mean effect sizes found for amisulpride were compared with those of an updated meta-analysis of the 5-HT(2)/D(2) antagonists.; Eighteen randomized controlled trials of amisulpride (N=2,214) were found. In 11 studies of acutely ill patients it proved to be consistently more effective than conventional antipsychotics for global schizophrenic symptoms (measured with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) and negative symptoms. Amisulpride is to date the only atypical antipsychotic for which several studies of patients suffering predominantly from negative symptoms have been published. In four such studies amisulpride was significantly more effective than placebo. Three small studies with conventional antipsychotics as comparators showed only a trend in favor of amisulpride in this regard. Amisulpride was associated with clearly lower use of antiparkinsonian medication and with fewer dropouts due to adverse events than conventional antipsychotics.; These results cast some doubt on the notion that combined 5-HT(2)/D(2) antagonism is the reason that the newer antipsychotic medications are effective for negative symptoms and have fewer extrapyramidal side effects.",5,E

The phenothiazines were followed by the butyrophenones, particularly haloperidol. With all the movement disorder side effects of these medications (extrapyramidal syndrome, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia), the pharmaceutical industry has gradually released atypical antipsychotics. This class includes clozapine (released in the USA in 1990), risperidone (1994), olanzapine (1996), quetiapine (1998) and ziprasidone (2001). However, the rate of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia appeared to increase with the availability of this class of medications. In reviewing rate and degree of changes in weight, glucose control and lipid levels induced by typical and atypical antipsychotics, it was found that in contrast to case reports, there is a dearth of retrospective, open and controlled studies. However, in studies as early as 1964, significant weight increases were found to be associated with use of chlorpromazine. While the phenothiazines may have some effect on patients with chemical diabetes, there is little evidence of the typical antipsychotics producing diabetes mellitus de novo, or worsening diabetes that is already been discovered. Ziprasidone appears to be the antipsychotic with the most beneficial combination of effects: no weight gain, no change in glucose utilisation and reductions in cholesterol and serum triglycerides (TGs).",5,E

There is a large variation in the stated prevalence of BSP, with crude estimates ranging from 16 to 133 per million in different studies. A large proportion of this variability may be the result of differences in physician education on BSP. Age and female gender may increase the risk of developing BSP. The few case-control studies focusing on adult dystonias including BSP showed an increased risk in association with family history of dystonia and/or postural tremor, prior head and face trauma, and prior eye disease (e.g., blepharitis and keratoconjunctivitis), and a decreased risk associated with cigarette smoking. No association was found with age-related medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, family history of parkinsonism, and a history of anxiety or depression. Broocks et al. [Am J Psychiatry, 1998;155:555-557] found a significantly higher frequency of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in BSP than hemifacial spasm despite the clinical similarity. Among putative risk factors for BSP, age at onset, female gender, and prior head or face trauma may affect spread of dystonia to adjacent body regions.

The information concerning the effects of antipsychotics on cytokine profiles are limited and often controversial in particular regarding novel antipsychotics. The authors first investigated the production of various cytokines [interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-10, interferon (INF)-gamma] in drug-free (n = 12) and drug-naive (n = 3) schizophrenic patients and in healthy controls (n = 33) and then the modifications of cytokines values during a 3-month period of treatment with risperidone. In the baseline condition, the production of IL-2 and INF-gamma was significantly higher (P = .023 and .026, respectively) in patients than in controls. In the same patients, the use of risperidone was associated with augmented IL-10 (a suppressor of Type I cytokines) and decreased INF-gamma production. This modification suggests that clinical improvement is associated with a reduction in the inflammatory-like situation present in not currently treated schizophrenic patients.",2,E

Manic symptoms were measured using the sum of six items of the BPRS, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. In addition, cognitive functioning was measured using the sum of seven items from the PANSS. Repeated measures analyses were performed using random coefficients regression of the serial measurement of manic, cognitive, and depressive symptoms.; A significant treatment difference was detected overall, indicating that olanzapine was significantly more effective than haloperidol in reducing symptoms of depression and improving patients' cognitive symptoms. The superiority of olanzapine over haloperidol in the reduction of manic symptoms did not reach statistical significance (P=.052). The greatest improvement in both manic and cognitive symptoms was seen in the olanzapine-treated 'currently manic' subgroup, and least improvement in the haloperidol-treated 'euthymic' subgroup.

Multiple therapeutic approaches are available for the treatment of patients not responding to standard antidepressant medication. These include switching medication or combination and augmentation strategies. A substantial number of patients do not respond to multiple treatment trials. These patients suffer from treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and represent a challenge to the treating physician. There have been a growing number of reports on the use of atypical antipsychotics as augmenting agents in nonpsychotic TRD. Second-generation antipsychotics are less likely to provoke parkinsonian side effects. It has also been reported that these agents produce lower rates of tardive movement disorders than traditional neuroleptics. Furthermore, second-generation antipsychotics are serotonin-2A/2C antagonists, possibly allowing them to improve the efficacy and some aspects of the side effect profile of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Weight gain and sedation are likely to be the most common adverse events of such combined therapy. In a recent controlled clinical trial, the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine was combined with fluoxetine therapy in an 8-week, double-blind clinical trial in patients with TRD. This combination drug therapy demonstrated clinical efficacy on several rating scales and showed rapid onset of action. Although more studies will be required to confirm and extend these findings, the results suggest that there may be a clinical benefit to combining atypical antipsychotics with SSRIs in nonpsychotic TRD.",5,E

Compared with risperidone, olanzapine treatment resulted in lower direct mental health care costs ($1,827 less, P < .03) and lower direct total health care costs ($1,834 less, P < .05). The results of this study suggest that the initial selection of an antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia is important: Olanzapine offset its acquisition cost by reducing medical service costs and demonstrated better drug treatment patterns than risperidone.",2,E

Relatively little research has focused on blood flow in the cerebellum of patients with bipolar disorder. Furthermore, the significance of metabolic changes in the brains of psychiatric patients may be confounded by the effects of various pharmacotherapies. Having previously found differences in cerebellar blood volume in patients with bipolar disorder compared to healthy control subjects, this study examined whether some variability in the patient population may be an effect of medication.; In this study, we have examined the association between medication status and cerebellar blood volume. Thirteen healthy comparison subjects and 21 bipolar patients underwent dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging. Nine cerebellar regions were identified, and the absolute cerebellar blood volume data from each was compared to medication status measures.; Patients on conventional antipsychotics had the lowest mean absolute blood volume measures for all cerebellar regions, whereas those on atypical antipsychotics had the highest blood volume measures. Comparison subjects had cerebellar blood volume measures in the middle, with results closer to subjects in the atypical group.; This evidence suggests that antipsychotic treatment may influence cerebellar blood volume. This effect will be important in considering imaging studies on medicated patients with bipolar disorder and may suggest novel pathways by which these medications affect their changes.",5,E

Diazepam showed a significantly greater anxiolytic effect than placebo at 1 hour (p < 0.05) but not at 3 hours. The sedative effect of ziprasidone was never greater than that of placebo, whereas that of diazepam was significantly greater than that of placebo 1 to 1.5 hours postdose. Ziprasidone was generally well tolerated. Only one patient reported treatment-related adverse events (nausea and vomiting) and, unlike diazepam, ziprasidone did not cause reductions in blood pressure. Dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, akathisia, and postural hypotension were not seen with ziprasidone.

This article will focus on the use of topiramate for bipolar disorder.; The pharmacological profile of topiramate is compared to other established and putative mood stabilizers, and a rationale for its use in bipolar disorder is presented. Data from open clinical trials of topiramate for depression, mania, and rapid-cycling bipolar disorder are summarized. Preliminary data from one pilot dose-finding, double-blind, random-assignment, placebo-controlled, 3-week parallel group study of two doses of topiramate for acute bipolar I mania is reported. Safety data regarding topiramate was reviewed. Finally, the potential place of this agent in bipolar illness is considered.; The pharmacological advantages for topiramate are low protein binding, minimal hepatic metabolism and mainly unchanged renal excretion, a 24-h half-life, and minimal drug interactions. Open clinical studies suggest a 50-65% response for refractory bipolar mania, and a 40-56% response for refractory bipolar depression in mainly add-on treatment. Open clinical studies of topiramate for rapid-cycling subjects and those for comorbid bulimia, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress, migraine, and obesity report effectiveness. The primary efficacy endpoint data (change from baseline Y-MRS total scores) of the placebo-controlled, random assignment parallel group phase II dose-finding study were not statistically significant. However, once the antidepressant-associated manias (28 of the sample, of 97 subjects) were excluded from the controlled study, the post-hoc analyses indicated the higher dose (512 mg/day) topiramate treatment group showed a statistically significant reduction in endpoint Y-MRS change scores as compared to placebo (p < 0.03). Adverse effects of topiramate in bipolar subjects include attention, concentration and memory problems, fatigue, sedation, transient paraesthesias, nausea, and anorexia. Some subjects experience word-finding difficulty. Weight loss may be seen in several topiramate-treated subjects with bipolar disorder.; Topiramate appears to show promise as an addition to the agents available to treat bipolar disorder. More definitive controlled data on the efficacy of topiramate in the acute and continuation phases as well as for the prophylaxis either as monotherapy or as combination treatment of bipolar disorder are ongoing, and the results are awaited.",3,E

Sixteen AD patients served as subjects in order to assess the efficacy of Risperidone administration, in the reduction or elimination of these delusions. The caregiver burden was evaluated using the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI) before the administration of Risperidone and 12 weeks after administration, for cases where delusions of theft were eliminated or reduced.; The burden of care on caregivers was significantly reduced (p < 0.001) through the elimination or reduction of delusions of theft.; Delusions of theft are considered to be a major factor in increasing the burden of care, and the treatment of these, through appropriate drug therapy, is therefore of great importance in the continuation of satisfactory care in the home.",5,E

This study used administrative data from a large national sample of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia to compare the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients receiving prescriptions for atypical and typical neuroleptics.; All outpatients with schizophrenia treated with typical and atypical neuroleptics over 4 months in 1999 in the Veterans Health Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) were included in this study. Patients treated with atypical neuroleptics were those who received prescriptions for clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine. Patients with a diagnosis of diabetes were also identified by using ICD-9 codes in VA administrative databases. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus across age groups and among patients receiving prescriptions for different atypical neuroleptics was examined with multiple logistic regression.; A total of 38,632 patients were included in the study: 15,984 (41.4%) received typical neuroleptics and 22,648 (58.6%) received any atypical neuroleptic (1,207 [5.3%] received clozapine; 10,970 [48.4%], olanzapine; 955 [4.2%], quetiapine; and 9,903 [43.7%], risperidone; 387 patients received prescriptions for more than one atypical neuroleptic). When the effects of age were controlled, patients who received atypical neuroleptics were 9% more likely to have diabetes than those who received typical neuroleptics, and the prevalence of diabetes was significantly increased for patients who received clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine, but not risperidone. However, for patients less than 40 years old, all of the atypical neuroleptics were associated with a significantly increased prevalence of diabetes.; In this large group of patients with schizophrenia, receipt of a prescription for atypical neuroleptics was significantly associated with diabetes mellitus.",I,7

Prescription and mental health service use data were collected from Medicaid claims files for the 12 months following the first filled antipsychotic prescription. Patterns of antipsychotic prescription were compared for African American (N=1,538, 61%) and Caucasian (N=977, 39%) subjects.; African American subjects were significantly younger and more likely to receive Supplemental Security Income than were the Caucasian subjects, who received mental health services more continuously. African American subjects were less likely than Caucasian subjects to receive clozapine (8% versus 15%, respectively) and risperidone (25% versus 31%) and more likely to receive depot antipsychotics (26% versus 14%). The likelihood of receiving clozapine or risperidone remained significantly different after demographic and service use characteristics were controlled.; This study found ethnic disparities in antipsychotic prescription patterns among a large number of publicly insured clients treated for schizophrenia. Given the rapidly changing pharmacological treatment environment, these findings have significant implications for differential quality of care for African American patients. Future studies employing client and provider characteristics are urgently needed to test alternative explanations for ethnic disparities.",I,2

Glucoregulatory abnormalities have also been associated with the use of antipsychotic medications themselves. While antipsychotics may increase adiposity, which can decrease insulin sensitivity, disease- and medication-related differences in glucose regulation might also occur independent of differences in adiposity.; Modified oral glucose tolerance tests were performed in schizophrenic patients (n = 48) receiving clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or typical antipsychotics, and untreated healthy control subjects (n = 31), excluding subjects with diabetes and matching groups for adiposity and age. Plasma was sampled at 0 (fasting), 15, 45, and 75 minutes after glucose load.; Significant time x treatment group interactions were detected for plasma glucose (F(12,222) = 4.89, P<.001) and insulin (F(12,171) = 2.10, P =.02) levels, with significant effects of treatment group on plasma glucose level at all time points. Olanzapine-treated patients had significant (1.0-1.5 SDs) glucose elevations at all time points, in comparison with patients receiving typical antipsychotics as well as untreated healthy control subjects. Clozapine-treated patients had significant (1.0-1.5 SDs) glucose elevations at fasting and 75 minutes after load, again in comparison with patients receiving typical antipsychotics and untreated control subjects. Risperidone-treated patients had elevations in fasting and postload glucose levels, but only in comparison with untreated healthy control subjects. No differences in mean plasma glucose level were detected when comparing risperidone-treated vs typical antipsychotic-treated patients and when comparing typical antipsychotic-treated patients vs untreated control subjects.; Antipsychotic treatment of nondiabetic patients with schizophrenia can be associated with adverse effects on glucose regulation, which can vary in severity independent of adiposity and potentially increase long-term cardiovascular risk.",I,2

At 2 h, olanzapine (5.0 mg, 2.5 mg) and lorazepam (1.0 mg) showed significant improvement over placebo on the PANSS Excited Component (PANSS-EC) and Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES), and both 5.0 mg olanzapine and lorazepam showed superiority to placebo on the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory. At 24 h, both olanzapine groups maintained superiority over placebo on the PANSS-EC; lorazepam did not. Olanzapine (5.0 mg) and lorazepam improved ACES scores more than placebo. Simpson-Angus and Mini-Mental State Examination scores did not change significantly from baseline. Sedation (ACES > or =8), adverse events, and laboratory analytes were not significantly different from placebo for any treatment. No significant differences among treatment groups were seen in extrapyramidal symptoms or in corrected QT interval at either 2 h or 24 h, and no significant differences among treatment groups were seen in vital signs, including orthostasis. Intramuscular injection of olanzapine may therefore provide substantial benefit in rapidly treating inpatients with acute dementia-related agitation.",3,E

However, a high incidence of severe adverse reactions highlights the need to find more favourable treatments. Atypical antipsychotics may combine efficacy in ameliorating some autistic symptoms with a lower incidence of some adverse reactions. This article reviews the use of atypical antipsychotics in autistic disorder, with particular focus on behaviour, cognition and physical well-being. Thirteen studies using risperidone, three using olanzapine, one using clozapine, one using amisulpride and one using quetiapine were identified. Few firm conclusions can be drawn due to the limitations of the studies; however, there is an indication that risperidone may be effective in reducing hyperactivity, aggression and repetitive behaviours, often without inducing severe adverse reactions. Olanzapine and clozapine may also be effective; however, there is little evidence for using amisulpride or quetiapine in this population. Randomized trials are required to clarify the effectiveness of these agents.",I,5

PPI refers to a response suppression in reaction to a strong startling stimulus, if preceded briefly by a weak non-startling stimulus and represents a well-established animal model to investigate information processing deficits in schizophrenia. This study examined PPI of the startle acoustic response in schizophrenic patients given typical antipsychotics or a second generation atypical antipsychotic, risperidone, using a naturalistic between-subjects design. Two groups of male schizophrenic patients: (i) stable on a range of typical antipsychotics (n = 20), and (ii) stable on risperidone (n = 10) were tested for PPI (prepulse-to-pulse intervals: 30, 60, and 120 ms, prepulses 15 dB above the background) of the acoustic startle response, and compared with a group of healthy male subjects (n = 20). Patients on typical antipsychotics showed significantly less PPI with 30 and 60 ms prepulse trials than healthy subjects. Risperidone-treated patients did not differ from healthy subjects for PPI with any prepulse trials. Further longitudinal within-subject studies are now required to examine whether risperidone is superior to typical antipsychotics in improving information processing functions, as assessed by PPI of the acoustic startle response, in treatment-responsive male patients with schizophrenia.",5,E

Manual searches of pertinent journal article references, request for medical information from Pfizer, and access of the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration were also performed.; All available published information regarding the pertinent characteristics of ziprasidone were considered for selection.; Pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies were selected to provide a comprehensive description of these characteristics. Clinical investigations were evaluated for design, sample size, diagnosis, duration, and outcome. Data from all investigations were selected by 1 author and reviewed by both authors.; Ziprasidone is a benzisothiazolyl piperazine-type atypical antipsychotic that shares the serotonin(2A)/dopamine(2) (5-HT(2A)/D(2)) profile of the available atypical antipsychotics. Ziprasidone has demonstrated in vitro activity as a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist and as a very weak inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. These data do not support ziprasidone as being a clinically meaningful inhibitor of serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake. Oral bioavailability of ziprasidone taken with food is approximately 60%, half-life is approximately 6-7 hours, and protein binding is extensive at >99%. Twelve metabolites have been identified, yet only 4 of these are considered to be primary metabolites. Metabolism of ziprasidone by aldehyde oxidase produces its only metabolite with potential pharmacologic activity; CYP3A4 also contributes to the metabolism of ziprasidone. Clinical studies support ziprasidone as efficacious for the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Daily doses permitted in these clinical trials ranged from 40 to 160 mg, but only doses between 120 and 160 mg/d have been superior to placebo. Future research efforts should be directed toward refractory schizophrenia, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, affective and anxiety symptoms associated with schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder. Adverse effect characteristics of ziprasidone commonly include headache, nausea, and somnolence; infrequent effects include extrapyramidal symptoms and weight gain. Ziprasidone has been reported to cause an average QTc prolongation of approximately 20 msec; there have only been 2 patients (0.06%) reported by the manufacturer to have a measured QTc interval >500 msec.; Ziprasidone is a safe and efficacious atypical antipsychotic for the acute management of schizophrenia. Efficacy data and most safety data for ziprasidone support its use as a first-line treatment for schizophrenia; however, its potential effects on ventricular repolarization relegate it to second-line status in patients with comorbid cardiovascular risks.",5,E

A dose-response relationship for IM olanzapine in the reduction of agitation was assessed by measuring the reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component (PANSS-EC) scores 2 hours after the first injection. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events and with extrapyramidal symptom scales and electrocardiograms at 24 hours after the first injection.; Olanzapine exhibited a dose-response relationship for reduction in agitation (F(1,179)= 14.4; P<.001). Mean PANSS-EC reductions 2 hours after the first injection of olanzapine (2.5 mg = -5.5; 5.0 mg = -8.1; 7.5 mg = -8.7; 10.0 mg = -9.4) were superior to those with placebo (-2.9; P =.01 vs olanzapine at 2.5 mg; P<.001 for each other olanzapine dose) but not with haloperidol (-7.5). A dose of 5.0, 7.5, or 10.0 mg of olanzapine caused a greater reduction in agitation than placebo 30 minutes after the first injection.

Patients were also randomly assigned to receive either haloperidol or risperidone. Therapists' fidelity to the manuals was measured. Patients' acquisition of the skills from pre- to posttraining was evaluated. The primary outcome measures were the Social Adjustment Scale-II and the Quality of Life Scale.; Seventy-one percent of the patients completed the trial. Only six participants experienced psychotic exacerbations during the trial. There was no evidence of a differential medication effect on social functioning. Social functioning improved modestly in both psychosocial conditions over time; participants who received augmented skills training in the community showed significantly greater and/or quicker improvements.; Given judicious and effective antipsychotic medication that limited exacerbations to less than 10% during the trial, a wide range of outpatients with schizophrenia demonstrated substantial learning of illness management and social skills in the clinic. When clinic-based skills training was augmented by in vivo training and consultation, transfer of the skills to everyday life was enhanced.

Accurate pharmacoepidemiologic data on whether such a hazard exists and its magnitude are needed to enable clinicians and patients to make proper treatment decisions about clozapine. The authors performed a case-control study involving 7,227 cases of newly treated diabetes and 6,780 controls, all with psychiatric disorders. Cases and controls were older than 20 years and enrolled in government-sponsored drug benefit programs in New Jersey. The authors measured the use of clozapine or other antipsychotic medications and additional covariates. They developed logistic regression models adjusted for demographic, clinical, and health care use characteristics to identify whether clozapine users were at increased risk to begin treatment for diabetes. Clozapine use was not significantly associated with developing diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-1.31). There was no suggestion of relationships between larger dosages or longer durations of clozapine use and increasing risks of diabetes. On the other hand, nonclozapine antipsychotic medication use was associated with a modest but significantly increased risk of developing diabetes (adjusted OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.22). Among individual nonclozapine antipsychotics, significantly elevated risks were observed for two phenothiazine agents: chlorpromazine (adjusted OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09-1.56) and perphenazine (adjusted OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11- 1.62). In contrast to earlier reports, these results provide some reassurance that clozapine does not increase the risk of developing diabetes.

We hypothesized that women would show a greater response to either medication than men, particularly among first admission, premenopausal women. DSM-III-R schizophrenia inpatients (700 women and 1295 men) were randomly assigned to a 6-week trial of Olz vs. Hal. Longitudinal random effect models were used to test for interactions of sex with medication, chronicity and menopausal status on treatment response. Findings showed that women on olanzapine had a greater drop in overall symptomatology by week 4 than any other group, and their level of symptomatology remained lower throughout the 6-week trial. The sex differences in treatment response in olanzapine compared with haloperidol were, in part, dependent on chronicity and, in women, menopausal status. That is, first episode women on haloperidol exhibited an increase in symptomatology over the 6-week trial compared to their male counterparts, while multiply hospitalized women had a better treatment response on haloperidol than their male counterparts. Women on olanzapine had a significantly better treatment response than men, regardless of chronicity. Finally, premenopausal women had a significantly better treatment response than postmenopausal women, regardless of treatment and chronicity.",I,I

Patients were switched from risperidone to olanzapine over a 2-week period, then treated with olanzapine for 8 additional weeks. The serum prolactin concentrations were examined every 2 weeks. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Simpson-Angus Scale for Extrapyramidal Symptoms (SAS), and questions from the Dickson-Glazer Sexual Functioning Scale were administered to evaluate efficacy, extrapyramidal side effects, and sexual and reproductive functioning at baseline and the endpoint of 10 weeks.; Serum prolactin levels decreased significantly (p < .01) following the switch from risperidone to olanzapine. Scores of PANSS, AIMS, and SAS at the endpoint were also significantly decreased (p < .01) compared to those of baseline. Patients experienced improvements in menstrual functioning and perceptions of sexual side effects.; Olanzapine reversed hyperprolactinemia in risperidone-treated female schizophrenic patients. This was associated with a decrease in amenorrhea, improved cycle regularity, and a decrease in sexual side effects that the women attributed to antipsychotic medication. This study suggests that switching to olanzapine is a safe and effective alternative method for patients with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia associated sexual and/or reproductive dysfunction. Long-term follow-up studies are warranted, with particular attention to the course of sexual and reproductive dysfunction.",7,E

Clinicians would be well served if clinical characteristics could be identified that predict a favorable response to clozapine. A few studies addressing this issue have reported inconsistent results.; The association of clinical characteristics with a sustained response was investigated in 37 partially treatment-refractory outpatients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia who had been assigned to clozapine treatment in a double-blind, haloperidol-controlled, long-term (29-week) study of clozapine. Response was defined as a 20% decrease of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) psychosis factor score sustained over 2 consecutive ratings. Differences between responders and nonresponders with regard to selected baseline variables were analyzed with t tests and chi2 tests. In addition, Cox regression analyses were performed to identify variables that best predicted a response to clozapine treatment.; Clozapine responders were rated as less severely ill, showed a lesser degree of negative symptoms, and demonstrated fewer extrapyramidal side effects at baseline as compared with nonresponders. In addition, higher BPRS total scores--after controlling for the effects of the other variables--were associated with a response.; In a cohort of partially treatment-refractory outpatients, a favorable response to clozapine was associated with characteristics describing less severely ill patients. The history of patients did not affect their response to clozapine.",2,E

The goal of this retrospective study was to examine the changes in weight parameters, fasting glucose, and fasting lipids in long-term inpatients treated with either risperidone or olanzapine.; A retrospective study was performed by reviewing charts of patients at Oregon State Hospital, Salem, who were treated during July and August 1999, comparing metabolic outcomes during the first year of therapy with either risperidone or olanzapine. Data were analyzed also by age, sex, and concurrent use of lithium or valproate. Included for analysis were patients at least 18 years old with baseline weights obtained within 3 weeks of drug initiation, and baseline fasting triglycerides, cholesterol, and glucose obtained within 3 months prior to drug initiation and at 1 year of treatment (+/- 4 weeks). The patients meeting these criteria in each drug cohort (risperidone, N = 47; olanzapine, N = 47) included 1 patient with diagnosed diabetes mellitus prior to onset of treatment.; Among those patients under 60 years old, olanzapine patients (N = 37) experienced significantly greater increases at 1 year in all metabolic parameters than the risperidone group (N = 39), except for weight variables: triglycerides +104.8 mg/dL (olanzapine) versus +31.7 mg/dL (risperidone) (p = .037); cholesterol +30.7 mg/dL (olanzapine) versus +7.2 mg/dL (risperidone) (p = .004); glucose +10.8 mg/dL (olanzapine) versus +0.74 mg/dL (risperidone) (p = .030). Patients under 60 years of age with concurrent use of lithium or valproate were associated with greater weight gain in both drug groups, but this difference was statistically significant only for the olanzapine cohort. Neither weight change nor use of lithium or valproate was associated with increases in glucose or lipids among those under 60 years old for either drug.; Olanzapine therapy is associated with significantly greater increases in fasting glucose and lipid levels for nongeriatric adult patients than risperidone, and the increases are not correlated with changes in weight parameters. Appropriate monitoring of fasting glucose and serum lipid levels should be considered during extended treatment with atypical antipsychotics.",I,4

In this study we assessed the effect of neuroleptic medication on thought disorder and semantic processing.; Seventeen patients with schizophrenia were assessed while receiving neuroleptic medications and in crossover fashion, placebo. A number of measures were obtained: clinically rated thought disorder (using the Thought, Language and Communication Scale); working memory letter number span); lexical integrity (naming and receptive vocabulary); and, semantic priming of intracategorical word pairs.; Semantic priming measures improved with neuroleptic medication, as did clinically rated thought disorder. No other measure changed significantly. Priming selectively covaried with changes in thought disorder.; Changes in spreading semantic activation, measured in a semantic priming paradigm and presumably brought about by neuroleptics' influence on dopaminergic neuromodulatory systems, might reflect changes in the biases of pre-existing associative networks that favour or increase the accessibility of representations related by shared features. This study also has implications for the architecture of normal language in that a dissociation between the lexical and semantic levels was observed, due to the selective compromise of tasks demanding semantic processing.",I,6

Unnatural causes and natural causes are put forward as reasons for this excess mortality. In terms of the latter, a host of different physical disorders occur with increased frequency in schizophrenia. When taken together, some of these illnesses such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disorders constitute the Metabolic Syndrome; a characteristic phenotype of those with this syndrome is excessive visceral fat distribution. The exact reasons why this particular syndrome occurs in schizophrenia is as yet unclear though factors such as life style, poor diet and lack of exercise may contribute to it's development. Alternatively, overactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis leading to hypercortisolaemia can also result in excessive visceral fat accumulation.

The Young Mania Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were used to quantify manic and depressive symptoms, respectively. Safety was assessed with several measures.; The protocol defined baseline-to-endpoint improvement in the mean total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale as the primary outcome variable. The mean Young Mania Rating Scale score decreased by 13.4 for patients treated with olanzapine (N=125) and 10.4 for those treated with divalproex (N=123). A priori categorizations defined response and remission rates: 54.4% of olanzapine-treated patients responded (> or = 50% reduction in Young Mania Rating Scale score), compared to 42.3% of divalproex-treated patients; 47.2% of olanzapine-treated patients had remission of mania symptoms (endpoint Young Mania Rating Scale < or = 12), compared to 34.1% of divalproex-treated patients. The decrease in Hamilton depression scale score was similar in the two treatment groups. Completion rates for the 3-week study were similar in both groups. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (incidence >10%) occurring more frequently during treatment with olanzapine were dry mouth, increased appetite, and somnolence. For divalproex, nausea was more frequently observed. The average weight gain with olanzapine treatment was 2.5 kg, compared to 0.9 kg with divalproex treatment.; The olanzapine treatment group had significantly greater mean improvement of mania ratings and a significantly greater proportion of patients achieving protocol-defined remission, compared with the divalproex treatment group.

After a washout period, 25 patients received 2-6 mg/day of risperidone plus placebo and 25 received risperidone plus 400 mg/day of celecoxib for 5 weeks.

However, the celecoxib group showed significantly greater improvement in the total score.; Additional treatment with celecoxib has significant positive effects on the therapeutic action of risperidone with regard to total schizophrenia psychopathology. Moreover, the fact that treatment with an immunomodulatory drug showed beneficial effects on schizophrenia symptoms indicates that immune dysfunction in schizophrenia is not just an epiphenomenon but is related to the pathomechanism of the disorder. However, a nonimmunological therapeutic effect of celecoxib mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor has to be taken into account.",3,E

Relapse, rehospitalization, limited fulfilment of social roles, and suicide remain frequent, and the economic costs are high. Current relapse rates may be two to three times higher than those that could be achieved with optimal use of therapy. Poor compliance with treatment is considered to be a significant preventable cause of poor outcome and is in turn likely to be influenced by the patient's experience of drug treatment. There is some evidence that extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), particularly akathisia and neuroleptic dysphoria, are associated with poor compliance and poor treatment outcome. Atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of EPS than do standard antipsychotics. Some (risperidone, olanzapine, and ziprasidone) show evidence of a dose-related increase in EPS, but clozapine and quetiapine have demonstrated a placebo-level incidence of EPS across the dose range. Quetiapine does not require the regular blood monitoring mandated for clozapine, and results from a patient survey indicate a high degree of patient satisfaction with treatment. While further research is needed, it is possible that wider use of medications with low EPS and high patient acceptability could promote better compliance and improve the outcome of schizophrenia treatment.",3,E

Recent studies and reviews have concluded that newer antipsychotic medications are better for neurocognitive deficits than conventional antipsychotic medications; however, one difficulty in interpreting this literature is that the comparisons have mainly been with high doses of conventional medications. This study examined the neurocognitive effects of low-dose haloperidol compared with risperidone over a 2-year period.; Sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to medication (starting at 6 mg of each medication) and administered neurocognitive batteries six times over the course of follow-up. At 6 months, the mean dose of haloperidol was 5.0 mg, and the mean dose of risperidone was 6.0 mg. Neurocognitive data were reduced into cluster scores and a global summary score.; We found no significant overall differences in treatment effects on the cluster scores or the global score. The global score revealed a significant group by time interaction, reflecting the fact that the haloperidol group tended to improve initially and then stay stable, whereas the risperidone group improved more gradually over the follow-up period.; This study did not provide support for neurocognitive advantages of a newer antipsychotic medication over a low-dose conventional medication. We speculate that conventional medications may have neurocognitive benefits at low doses that are neutralized or reversed at higher doses.",I,I

All captured costs from patients who began olanzapine therapy between November 1, 1996, and April 30, 1998, were analyzed in an intent-to-treat fashion to compare resource utilization in the 12 months immediately before and after the intervention. Clinical function was assessed at baseline and 6 months using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). In a subgroup analysis, the baseline characteristics of patients who completed 12 months of olanzapine treatment were compared with those of patients who (1) changed medication or (2) changed pay or source or were lost to follow-up.; One hundred eighty-nine patients were started on olanzapine treatment during the 18-month study entry phase. Patients were primarily male (63.5%) and had a mean age of 35.9 years. Most (66.3%) had a formal diagnosis of thought disorder. Fifty-six patients received olanzapine for 12 consecutive months, and 22 were switched to other psychotropic medications. Of the remaining 111 patients, 70 changed payors (ie, qualified for Medicaid), and 41 were lost to follow-up. In the subgroup analysis, patients who completed 12 months of treatment (ie, responders) had significantly lower mean PANSS total scores at baseline compared with those who changed payors or were lost to follow-up (P = 0.047), and were significantly more likely to have a formal diagnosis of thought disorder (P = 0.039). Responders demonstrated a significant reduction in PANSS total and negative subscale scores at 6-month follow-up (both measures, P < 0.001).

We also examined how antipsychotic class predicts smoking cessation outcomes with bupropion.; Thirty-two subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and nicotine dependence were randomized to bupropion SR (BUP, 300 mg/day) or placebo (PLA). Outcomes included treatment retention, smoking abstinence rates, expired breath carbon monoxide (CO) levels, psychotic symptoms, and medication side effects.; Bupropion significantly increased trial endpoint 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence rates compared with placebo [BUP, 8/16 (50.0%), PLA, 2/16 (12.5%); chi(2) = 5.24, df = 1, p <.05], and reduced CO levels during the trial [Medication x Time interaction; Z = 3.09, p <.01]. Positive schizophrenia symptoms were not altered by BUP, but negative symptoms were significantly reduced. Atypical antipsychotic drug treatment enhanced smoking cessation responses to BUP. Major side effects were dry mouth, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and insomnia.; Our results suggest that 1) BUP enhances smoking abstinence rates compared with PLA in nicotine-dependent schizophrenic smokers; 2) BUP is well-tolerated and safe for use in these patients; and 3) atypical antipsychotics may enhance smoking cessation outcomes with BUP.",3,E

Publications in all languages were searched from all relevant databases and all randomized controlled trials comparing clozapine with newer atypical drugs were included. The review and meta-analysis includes eight studies, most of them short in duration. Newer atypical drugs were broadly similar to clozapine when improvement was measured using a psychosis symptom rating scale or a global index. There was a trend for clozapine to be more effective than the others for positive symptoms, and less effective for the negative symptoms. The adverse effect profile of clozapine and newer atypical drugs was dissimilar: while clozapine produced more fatigue, hypersalivation, and orthostatic dizziness, new atypical drugs, with the exception of olanzapine, produced more extrapyramidal symptoms. As these results were obtained from few studies and a relatively small amount of patients, the equal effectiveness and tolerability of new atypical drugs in comparison with clozapine is not yet demonstrated. More trials of sufficient power, with longer duration, and measuring clinically important outcomes are urgently needed.",I,I

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of D-cycloserine when added to risperidone on negative symptoms of schizophrenia.; Ten patients with schizophrenia who were treated with risperidone completed consecutive two week trials of placebo and four doses of D-cycloserine. Clinical assessments were videotaped and were scored by a rater who was blind to temporal sequence.; D-Cycloserine at a dose of 50mg/day was associated with significant reduction in negative symptoms (mean=10%). Ratings of depression, extrapyramidal side effects, and cognitive function were unchanged. Serum concentrations of glutamate and serine increased significantly on this dose of D-cycloserine.; This preliminary study suggests that combination of D-cycloserine, 50mg/day, with risperidone may improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia over a narrow dose range. The degree of improvement appears to be intermediate between improvement of negative symptoms observed with combination of D-cycloserine with conventional antipsychotics and worsening of negative symptoms observed with combination of D-cycloserine with clozapine in previous trials of identical design.",3,E

12091788,[What is the interest of Klinefelter's syndrome for (child) psychiatrists?].,"Adult; Comorbidity; Diagnosis, Differential; Humans; Klinefelter Syndrome; Male; Patient Care Team; Psychotic Disorders; Social Behavior","Kebers, F; Janvier, S; Colin, A; Legros, J J; Ansseau, M","Klinefelter's syndrome (KS) concerns men and is usually characterized by tallness, underdeveloped testes and sterility. It is generally due to the 47,XXY genotype, ie one extra X chromosome in each cell. Its estimated frequency among newborn boys is 1/500 to 1/700. It seems that 64% KS would be undiagnosed. Abnormally low levels of testosterone blood values are very common in this syndrome. In this case, replacement androgen therapy should be initiated (ideally at the age of 11-15) which prevents osteoporosis and enhances secondary sexual features. Case report - Since early childhood, Mr X has been shy, passive with few friends. When he was 13 years old, the school physician noted a delay of puberty and referred him to an endocrinologist who diagnosed KS. Androgen therapy was introduced but rapidly stopped, because the boy and his parents thought it was useless. Mr X consulted a psychiatrist at the age of 21. He presented a schizo-affective disorder with influence syndrome, auditory and visual hallucinations, labile mood with disinhibited and depressive periods. He was admitted in a psychiatry ward of a general hospital. An endocrinologist confirmed the diagnosis of KS and found very low blood testosterone levels. Besides lithium and risperidone which had already been introduced before the hospitalization, androgens (testosterone undecanoate) were very progressively given to Mr X with a daily psychiatric evaluation. One month after discharge, a major depressive episode led to the adjunction of citalopram. After one year of follow-up, Mr X shows increased social adjustment and enhanced interest; the influence syndrome has partially regressed and his mood is more stable. Discussion - In the years '60 and '70, systematic screenings in psychiatric hospitals have detected 1.3% KS among hospitalized boys, ie 10 times more than in the general population, and 0.6 to 1% KS among hospitalized men. A large variety of psychiatric disorders have been described. Boys presenting KS are usually described as shy, with little energy and initiative, and few friends. They cry more often than compares. Neuropsychological studies demonstrate significantly lower verbal IQ than controls, while performance IQ is generally normal and global IQ is in the normal range with large individual variations. Language acquisition is always delayed. However, agressiveness is not increased. In his follow-up study of 20 years, Nielsen at al found more psychiatric disorders among KS patients, compared to a group of hypogonadal patients at first examination (mean age=27 years). After 20 years follow-up, however, no significant difference remained between the two cohorts concerning the frequency of psychiatric hospitalizations or mental diseases. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain psychological aspects of KS such as low levels of androgens during foetal and child development, personality disorder related to hypogonadism, delay of mitosis of cells with an extra X chromosome, but none of them is able to explain the specificity of psychological problems associated with KS. Concerning therapeutic aspects, specialists prone substitutive androgen therapy in case of too low testosterone blood levels, from the time of increase in FSH (around the age of 11-15). It prevents osteoporosis, backache and excessive tiredness often found in males with KS; testosterone also improves social drive, mood, concentration and ability at work. If KS diagnosis is made at adult age, androgen therapy has also shown some efficacy, though less than if started earlier. Due to the oral and written language problems of KS boys between 5 and 12 years of age, Graham et al. recommend anticipatory guidance for these boys. In addition, they insist on the importance of the information of the parents, language therapy, the reduction of the length of the instructions given by schoolmasters and specially stimulating and stable childhood conditions. Though it is generally thought that androgens increase agressiveness, we found no consistent data in litterature proving that the restoration of physiological androgen blood levels increases crimes nor aggressiveness. In the contrary, Miller and Sulkes described four cases of KS men presenting chronic fire-setting behaviors. Testosterone was introduced. For three of them, follow-up was available: their behavior seemed improved and none of them recurred. However, the initiation of androgen therapy for patients with severe psychiatric illness should be done very carefully. Conclusion - The Klinefelter's syndrome is frequent and, if not diagnosed (which seems to be the most common case), these men have higher risks to develop psychiatric disorders. Therefore, child psychiatrists and psychiatrists should evoke that diagnosis when they examine boys or men who present typical physical traits of KS (tallness, underdevelopped testes) associated to school problems and/or psychiatric disorders. Indeed, if the diagnosis is confirmed by an endocrinologist and a genetic testing, psychological follow-up and testosterone undecanoate treatment (in case of abnormal testosterone blood levels) should be initiated. This therapy generally improves physical well-being and improves mood, concentration, capacity at work. There is no consistent data in the litterature proving that restoring physiological testosterone blood levels would be dangerous for KS men presenting severe psychiatric troubles. However, this should be discussed in each situation with caution, and androgens should be introduced very progressively.",5,E

We measured arterial plasma levels of NE and other catechols during intravenous infusion of tritium-labeled NE (3H-NE) in risperidone-treated patients and compared their data with those from patients treated with clozapine or placebo. NE levels in risperidone patients were significantly higher than in placebo patients, but lower than in clozapine patients. Neither drug, however, had significant effect on plasma levels of the main neuronal metabolite of NE, dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), suggesting that adrenoceptors blockade alone would not explain the NE findings. The rate of release of endogenous NE into the bloodstream (spillover) was elevated in both risperidone and clozapine patients in a manner that paralleled their NE levels; the NE clearance in both groups did not differ from placebo. Following 3H-NE infusion in risperidone-treated individuals, production of 3H-DHPG was normal, as it was in the clozapine group, suggesting that risperidone does not impede neuronal uptake or intraneuronal metabolism of NE by monoamine oxidase. Our data suggest that both risperidone and clozapine elevate plasma NE levels via enhanced neurotransmitter spillover, with risperidone producing a smaller effect.",2,E

This translated into a reduction of 7,300 pounds in hospitalization costs per patient started on clozapine, over the 2-year period. In those patients who continued clozapine treatment for the whole of the 2-year period, there was a two-thirds reduction in number of admissions and total time spent in hospital compared to no change in the clozapine discontinuers.

The study design comprised a 3-week acute phase followed by a 49-week open label extension. In the open label extension, the use of lithium and fluoxetine was permitted for patients who experienced breakthrough symptoms. Clinical, economic, and quality-of-life outcomes of treatment were assessed.; During the acute phase, olanzapine patients experienced a statistically significant greater mean improvement from baseline on the Y-MRS total score compared to the placebo patients. In the open label extension, patients experienced a statistically significant mean change of 11.8 units on the Y-MRS from the end of the acute phase. When compared to costs incurred in the previous 12 months of therapy, patients experienced savings of almost $900 per month during the 49 weeks of olanzapine therapy. These cost savings were largely driven by reductions in in-patient costs during the open label extension. Health-related quality of life improvements measured by the SF-36 were seen on several dimensions both in the 3-week acute phase as well as in the 49-week open label extension.; From a clinical, economic, and quality-of-life outcomes standpoint, olanzapine had a significant impact in the treatment of mania, and could be considered a cost-effective treatment option for use in this population if these findings are extrapolated to non-clinical trial populations.",I,I

Preclinical pharmacology suggests that sertindole has a preferential effect on the activity of limbic and cortical dopaminergic neurons. Clinical trials have shown antipsychotic efficacy and very few extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) with sertindole at 20 mg/day.; This positron emission tomography (PET) study aimed to measure D(2) receptor occupancy in striatal and extra-striatal regions induced by clinically representative doses of sertindole in patients with schizophrenia.; Four stabilized schizophrenic out-patients received sertindole 20 mg/day for 6-8 weeks. PET was performed using [(11)C]raclopride to measure D(2) receptor occupancy in the striatum and [(11)C]FLB457 to measure occupancy in the neocortex and thalamus, i.e. regions with very low D(2) receptor density.; Striatal D(2) receptor occupancy was 52-68%. Similar occupancies were found in the thalamus, and the temporal and frontal cortices.; Sertindole appears efficacious at a low D(2) receptor occupancy, comparable to that produced by clozapine. This finding could explain the low risk of EPS. The functional limbic selectivity of sertindole was not reflected in regional differences in receptor occupancy.",3,E

Twenty patients on each drug and 22 controls were studied with measures of the resting motor threshold, motor evoked potential size, post-excitatory silent period duration, cortical inhibition and facilitation to paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcallosal inhibition.; The patient groups differed from the controls in the silent period and transcallosal inhibition measures, both of which assess cortical inhibitory activity. The two medication groups differed in the magnitude of the resting motor threshold and several measures of transcallosal inhibition that reflect the spread of inhibitory activity between hemispheres.; These findings suggest that olanzapine and risperidone differ subtly in their effects on cortical inhibitory mechanisms.

More than 50 % of all psychiatric patients and 10 % of schizophrenic patients show aggressive symptoms varying from threatening behavior and agitation to assault. The pharmacological treatment of acute, persisting and repetitive aggression is a serious problem for other patients and staff members. Not only is violent behavior from mentally ill patients the most detrimental factor in their stigmatization, aggression is also a considerable direct source of danger for the patients themselves. Based on rather limited evidence, a wide variety of medications for the pharmacological treatment of aggression has been recommended: typical and atypical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, beta-blockers and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Most clinical information on treating aggression has been collected for atypical neuroleptics, particularly for clozapine. Several retrospective and open studies indicate its efficacy. Treatment duration of 6 months is recommended to induce a stable reduction of physical and verbal aggression. Severe side effects have very rarely been seen. At the moment, clozapine seems to be the first choice in aggression treatment. Within the last few years, about 10 articles were published showing that this is the most effective antiaggressive agent in the treatment of aggression and agitation in psychiatric patients, independent of psychiatric diagnosis. However, clozapine, like all the other substances used, does not have an established indication for the treatment of aggressive symptoms. Noncompliance with medication makes it difficult to choose the right preparation for the medication: tablets, liquids, intramuscular injections and readily soluble ""FDDFs"" are available. Ethical, juridical and methodological problems prevent controlled studies from establishing a reference in the treatment of aggression in mentally ill patients. This review summarizes the current discussion and publications on the pharmacological treatment of aggression in schizophrenic patients of the last 20 years. In addition, we will briefly present studies and case reports concerning the treatment of aggression in other psychiatric patients.",5,E

The known risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia include prior suicide attempts, substance abuse, male sex, onset during first decade of illness, social isolation, depression, and feelings of hopelessness. There is significant evidence suggesting that clozapine reduces the suicide rate in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Possible factors that lead to a decrease in suicidality with clozapine include the following: a direct antidepressant action, improved cognitive function and insight, diminished negative symptoms, reduced substance abuse, and improved compliance. These effects may converge or lessen feelings of hopelessness and more of its converse optimism. The International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT) is a large prospective, 2-year randomized trial of the comparative effects of clozapine and olanzapine involving 980 patients at high risk for suicide in 11 countries in 56 sites. The study included complete freedom to augment these treatments if needed, blinded ratings, a blinded Suicide Monitoring Board, and equivalent clinical contact. The results support the superiority of clozapine over olanzapine to reduce the risk of suicidality and suggest its use should be considered for all patients with schizophrenia with high risk for suicide.",I,5

Observational studies, which follow large cohorts of typical patients receiving pharmacological treatments, should overcome some of these trial limitations and provide information that cannot be generated with clinical trials. The present study aimed to compare experimental and observational studies of clozapine-treated subjects with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. A systematic review of experimental and observational studies evaluating clozapine-treated subjects in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was carried out. We identified 50 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Less than one-third of clinical trials enrolled more than 50 patients compared to 44% of prospective and nearly 90% of retrospective studies. In addition, 78% of prospective and 89% of retrospective observational studies lasted more than 12 weeks, while the majority of trials lasted less than 8 weeks. Most clinical trials defined treatment-resistant schizophrenia according to Kane's criteria, while the majority of observational studies adopted implicit criteria. In comparison with clinical trials, observational studies provided a higher weighted mean rate of clozapine-responders and a lower weighted mean rate of clozapine-dropouts. This literature survey suggests that the role of observational studies in the evaluation of medicines should be reconsidered.

Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: the direct switch group (N = 54) received only olanzapine, while the start-taper switch group (N = 54) received olanzapine and their usual antipsychotic in decreasing doses for the first 2 weeks. A successful switch was defined as completing 6 weeks of therapy without worsening of symptoms (Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale [CGI-S]) or extrapyramidal side effects (Simpson-Angus Scale). Overall efficacy was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and safety was assessed by recording adverse events and measuring vital signs.; Statistically significant (p < .001) improvements from baseline to endpoint occurred in both switch groups in the CGI-S score and the PANSS total score and subscores. However, no significant differences were observed between the switch groups for any efficacy measure. Both techniques had comparable rates of successful switching (direct switch, 74.1% vs. start-taper switch, 67.9%). The frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between switch groups with no clinically significant differences in any laboratory value or vital sign. Weight gain occurred in both switch groups (p < .001), but the groups were not statistically different from each other. Both switch groups showed statistically significant (p < .01) improvements from baseline to endpoint on the Simpson-Angus Scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale.; Moderately ill Asian patients with schizophrenia may experience a decrease in symptom severity and improvement in extrapyramidal symptoms when switched from their current medication to olanzapine therapy.",3,E

Limited information is available concerning naturalistic outcome of patients selected for clinical treatment with atypical antipsychotics. This study evaluates 1-year discharge rates among all patients treated with risperidone within the New York State inpatient psychiatric hospital system during the calendar years 1994 and 1995 (""period of interest"") relative to patients treated with all other antipsychotic medications.; Data from the Integrated Research Database at Nathan Kline Institute (Orangeburg, N.Y.) were used. This database maintains complete treatment records for all inpatients within the New York State psychiatric inpatient system along with demographic, diagnostic, admission, and discharge information. Patients were identified at admission or first change in antipsychotic during the period of interest, and 1-year outcome was determined.; 2198 risperidone-treated patients were identified versus 3259 treated with other antipsychotics. Length of hospitalization prior to treatment initiation was the primary predictor of discharge rate for both risperidone and control groups. When adjustment was made for between-group difference in prognosis (dischargeability), patients treated with risperidone within 30 days of admission were less likely to be discharged than those treated with all other agents (including clozapine), whereas risperidone was more effective in patients who had been hospitalized for 90 days or more prior to switch from another antipsychotic to risperidone.; When database information is utilized to evaluate treatment effectiveness, adjustment must be made for a priori differences in prognosis or dischargeability. With appropriate methodology, database studies may indicate which patient groups are most likely to benefit from newer atypical antipsychotic agents.",4,E

However, data on the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotic agents in children are limited.; We conducted a multisite, randomized, double-blind trial of risperidone as compared with placebo for the treatment of autistic disorder accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children 5 to 17 years old. The primary outcome measures were the score on the Irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the rating on the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement (CGI-I) scale at eight weeks.; A total of 101 children (82 boys and 19 girls; mean [+/-SD] age, 8.8+/-2.7 years) were randomly assigned to receive risperidone (49 children) or placebo (52). Treatment with risperidone for eight weeks (dose range, 0.5 to 3.5 mg per day) resulted in a 56.9 percent reduction in the Irritability score, as compared with a 14.1 percent decrease in the placebo group (P<0.001). The rate of a positive response, defined as at least a 25 percent decrease in the Irritability score and a rating of much improved or very much improved on the CGI-I scale, was 69 percent in the risperidone group (34 of 49 children had a positive response) and 12 percent in the placebo group (6 of 52, P<0.001). Risperidone therapy was associated with an average weight gain of 2.7+/-2.9 kg, as compared with 0.8+/-2.2 kg with placebo (P<0.001). Increased appetite, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, and drooling were more common in the risperidone group than in the placebo group (P<0.05 for each comparison). In two thirds of the children with a positive response to risperidone at eight weeks (23 of 34), the benefit was maintained at six months.; Risperidone was effective and well tolerated for the treatment of tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children with autistic disorder. The short period of this trial limits inferences about adverse effects such as tardive dyskinesia.",I,I

Clozapine treatment was associated with significant weight gain in the double blind and open-label trials. Haloperidol treatment was not associated with significant weight gain. Neither clozapine nor haloperidol treatment were associated with significant changes in mean arterial blood pressure. There were no significant correlations between weight gain and mean arterial blood pressure change with either medication. Although clozapine treatment is associated with weight gain, the correlation between this weight gain and increases in arterial blood pressure during the first year of treatment appears to be low.",I,I

In preclinical studies, ziprasidone was predicted to have efficacy against positive, negative and affective symptoms of schizophrenia with a favourable tolerability profile, including a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal adverse effects. The drug has been administered orally to >300 patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in published 4- to 6-week randomised, double-blind trials. When given twice daily at dosages of between 80 and 160 mg/day, ziprasidone produced significantly greater improvements in overall symptomatology than placebo. In the largest study, ziprasidone 80 or 160 mg/day was also significantly more effective than placebo in reducing negative symptoms and, at 160 mg/day, was significantly more effective than placebo in improving depressive symptoms in patients with associated clinically significant depression. Data from a 4-week trial indicate that ziprasidone 160 mg/day has similar efficacy to haloperidol 15 mg/day. Ziprasidone 40 to 160 mg/day was more effective than placebo with respect to prevention of impending relapse and improvement of negative symptoms in 294 stable patients with chronic schizophrenia who were treated for up to 1 year. In addition, significantly more ziprasidone than haloperidol recipients achieved a negative symptom response in a 28-week study involving 301 stable patients with chronic or subchronic schizophrenia. In general, oral ziprasidone is well tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. Importantly, the drug has a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects and a negligible effect on bodyweight. Ziprasidone is associated with slight prolongation of the QTc interval; the clinical significance of this is not yet clear. The drug does not appear to be associated with sustained elevation of plasma prolactin levels. Preliminary data indicate that long-term oral ziprasidone treatment is well tolerated. Ziprasidone is the only novel antipsychotic currently available in a rapid-acting intramuscular formulation. Short-term treatment with intramuscular ziprasidone was effective and well tolerated in patients with acute agitation associated with psychosis. In addition, intramuscular ziprasidone reduced agitation scores by a significantly greater extent than haloperidol in a study involving patients with acute agitation associated with psychosis.; Ziprasidone is a promising new antipsychotic that has shown significant efficacy in the oral treatment of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The drug is well tolerated with a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects and a negligible effect on bodyweight. In addition, intramuscular ziprasidone shows efficacy and good tolerability in the treatment of acute agitation associated with psychotic disorders.",5,E

This double-blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing flexible dosing of olanzapine (5-20 mg/day, n = 234) to haloperidol (3-15 mg/day, n = 219), consisted of a 6-week acute phase, followed by a 6-week continuation phase. Symptomatic remission rates were similar for olanzapine- and haloperidol-treated patients at weeks 6 and 12. At week 6, significant changes in five dimensions of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) [general health (P = 0.010), physical functioning (P < 0.001), role limitations due to physical problems (P < 0.001), social functioning (P < 0.05) and vitality (P < 0.01)] and the SF-36 physical components summary score were found in favour of olanzapine compared to haloperidol.

A population approach was used to investigate clozapine pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of clozapine in patients. Clozapine plasma concentrations were obtained in 23 patients from therapeutic drug monitoring (83 samples). CYP1A2 activity was estimated by the norclozapine/clozapine plasma levels ratio and data were processed by a nonlinear mixed-effect modelling method. Different covariates (age, body weight, height, CYP1A2 activity, daily dose of clozapine) were tested but CYP1A2 activity was the single parameter that improved significantly the predictive model. The best fit was obtained by integration of a linear relationship between clozapine clearance and CYP1A2 activity. The findings suggest that (i) CYP1A2 activity is a major factor that determines clozapine clearance and (ii) the norclozapine/clozapine ratio could constitute a valuable measure of the CYP1A2 activity. This ratio can be simply determined in the context of therapeutic drug monitoring and could explain the inter- and intraindividual variation of clozapine plasma levels.",2,E

Differences between manufacturers' recommended dosing and actual clinical practice are reconciled using evidence from pivotal double-blind randomized registration studies, other randomized clinical trials, case series, and case reports. With clozapine and perhaps olanzapine, plasma levels are correlated with therapeutic response; with risperidone, plasma levels are not correlated with therapeutic response but may be related to the occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms. Information related to optimal dosing of quetiapine and ziprasidone is more limited. In clinical practice, the mean daily dose of risperidone has decreased, whereas that for olanzapine is increasing. The percentage of patients receiving quetiapine at doses above the manufacturer's recommended maximum is higher than would be expected, further illustrating that dosing ranges established during registration studies may not reflect the needs of day-to-day practice.",I,5

The ensuing natural history of transitions in treatments was charted, and the outcomes including symptoms, side effects, subjective tolerability of drugs and their impact on quality of life were documented with standardized rating scales.; Majority (85%) of the subjects benefited from a switch to the novel antipsychotic drugs, though some preferred to return to their original neuroleptic (8%), and others eventually required clozapine (7%) therapy. Novel antipsychotic drugs were significantly tolerated better, and had a positive impact on treatment-adherence, psychosocial functioning and quality of life. Among the novel drugs, risperidone was significantly better in improving negative symptoms, while olanzepine was particularly well tolerated and effective against comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. Patients treated with quetiapine reported fewer side effects, and showed a significantly greater improvement in neurocognitive deficits.; Novel antipsychotics emerged as the drug of choice in view of their overall effectiveness, though conventional neuroleptics and clozapine will continue to have a limited but distinct role in the management of schizophrenia.

The primary purpose of this study was to compare EPS profiles in Japanese schizophrenic patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, or a typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, as measured by the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). The DIEPSS, which consists of eight individual parameters and one global assessment (overall severity), was used to evaluate 182 patients enrolled in this 8-week study. The primary safety analysis was maximum change (that could be either a decrease or increase) from baseline in DIEPSS total score. Secondary analyses included change from baseline to maximum in DIEPSS total score, change from baseline to endpoint (LOCF) in DIEPSS total score, and the rank sum of the maximum change (that could be either a decrease or increase) from baseline in the DIEPSS individual items. Incidence of treatment-emergent EPS adverse events using the DIEPSS scale was also analyzed. The olanzapine group showed statistically significant superiority to the haloperidol group on the primary analysis (p<0.001). Secondary analyses also demonstrated olanzapine's superiority in DIEPSS total, parkinsonism, akathisia and overall severity scores (all p< or =0.014). Categorical analysis of treatment-emergent akathisia and parkinsonism syndromes at endpoint showed improvement in the olanzapine group but worsening in the haloperidol group. The results from this study suggest that olanzapine, as in Caucasian populations, is a safe treatment in Japanese patients chronically ill with schizophrenia.",I,I

We report results from two placebo-controlled, double-blind studies of olanzapine for treatment of dopamimetic drug-induced psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).; Patients were treated with olanzapine or placebo for 4 weeks while dopamimetic therapy was held constant. Olanzapine was initiated at 2.5 mg/day, with 2.5-mg/day increases allowed every 3 to 4 days up to the maximum dose of 15 mg/day.; Olanzapine patients showed significant improvements from baseline on positive symptoms and most efficacy measures, but no significant treatment-group differences were observed. Olanzapine performed significantly worse than placebo in both studies on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total, Motor, and Activities of Daily Living scales, but not the UPDRS Tremor item or Complications scores. Corrected QT interval, vital signs, and body weight were not significantly different from placebo.; These findings did not demonstrate superior efficacy of olanzapine for treatment of dopamimetic-induced psychosis in PD.

Subjects included 34 residents with dementia who were on antipsychotics for more than 6 months and whose behavior was currently stable. Subjects were randomized to either continue receiving their regular dosage of antipsychotics or to receive placebo for 6 months. Early withdrawal from the study was not statistically different between the groups (relative risk [RR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-3.26), and though not significantly different, subjects in the placebo group were more likely to be withdrawn from the study because of worsening behavior (RR = 1.25, 95% Cl 0.33-4.76). Three subjects in the placebo group were withdrawn from the study due to worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms. The active treatment group had more behavioral problems (e.g., physical aggression towards others, p < .05) compared to the placebo group. The placebo group developed more apathy, but balancing this outcome was a relative improvement in cognitive functioning. Baseline antipsychotic dose was predictive of behavioral worsening upon discontinuation of long-term antipsychotic drugs. The primary limitation of the study was the small sample size. In conclusion, a trial of discontinuation of antipsychotics should be considered in this population.",3,E

The rapidly evolving disciplines of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics seek to uncover this genetic variation in order to predict treatment outcomes. The goal is to be able to select the drugs with the greatest likelihood of benefit and the least likelihood of harm in individual patients, based on their genetic make-up-individualized therapy. Pharmacogenomic studies utilize genomic technologies to identify chromosomal areas of interest and novel putative drug targets, while pharmacogenetic strategies rely on studying sequence variations in candidate genes suspected of affecting drug response or toxicity. The candidate gene variants that affect function of the gene or its protein product have the highest priority for investigation. This review will provide demonstrative examples of functional candidate gene variants studied in a variety of antipsychotic response phenotypes in the treatment of schizophrenia. Serotonin and dopamine receptor gene variants in clozapine response will be examined, and in the process the need for sub-phenotypes will be pointed out. Our recent pharmacogenetic studies of the subphenotype of neurocognitive functioning following clozapine treatment and the dopamine D(1) receptor gene (DRD1) will be presented, highlighting our novel neuroimaging data via [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) metabolism position emission tomography (PET) that demonstrates hypofunctioning of several brain regions in patients with specific dopamine D(1) genotype. Preliminary candidate gene studies investigating the side-effect of clozapine-induced weight gain are also presented. The antipsychotic adverse reaction of tardive dyskinesia and its association with the dopamine D(3) receptor will be critically examined, as well as the added influence of antipsychotic metabolism via the cytochrome P450 1A2 gene (CYP1A2 ). Results that delineate the putative gene-gene interaction between DRD3 and CYP1A2 are also presented. We have also utilized FDG-PET subphenotyping to demonstrate increased brain region activity in patients who have the dopamine D(3) genotype that confers increased risk for antipsychotic induced tardive dyskinesia. The merits and weaknesses of neuroimaging technologies as applied to pharmacogenetic analyses are discussed. To the extent that the above data become more widely verified and replicated, the field of psychiatry will move closer to clinically meaningful tests that will be useful in deciding the best drug for each individual patient.",5,I

In this study, pharmacokinetic interactions and clinical effects of adding the CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine to steady-state olanzapine was examined in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Eight patients had been treated for at least 3 months with 10 to 20 mg/day olanzapine. Fluvoxamine (100 mg/day) was added (week 0) to the olanzapine treatment and continued for 8 weeks. Concentrations of olanzapine and its metabolite N-desmethylolanzapine and of fluvoxamine were analyzed at weeks 0, 1, 4, and 8. Addition of fluvoxamine resulted in a 12% to 112% ( < 0.01) increase of olanzapine from 31 +/- SD 15 ng/mL (week 0) to 56 +/- 31 ng/mL (week 8) in all patients. N-desmethylolanzapine concentrations were not significantly changed ( > 0.05). Fluvoxamine concentrations were 48 +/- 26 ng/mL on week 1 and 83 +/- 47 ng/mL on week 8. It is concluded that fluvoxamine affects olanzapine degradation and thus increases olanzapine concentrations. Although the combination was well tolerated in this sample and the negative symptom response appeared to be favorable in at least five patients, the combination therapy of olanzapine and fluvoxamine should be used cautiously and should be controlled by therapeutic drug monitoring to avoid olanzapine-induced side effects or intoxications.",6,E

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, unforced titration, parallel design study (2:1 drug to placebo randomization ratio) using olanzapine (2.5-10 mg/day to effect) in 30 PD patients with drug-induced hallucinations. We performed an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), assessments of on and off time at baseline and at 9 weeks after starting the medication. Sixteen patients on olanzapine (mean dose, 4.6 mg/night) and 11 on placebo completed the study.

A neuropsychological test battery did not show any significant differences. Total on UPDRS motor scores (P < 0.05) and timed tapping (P < 0.01) worsened while on drug compared to placebo. Bradykinesia (P < 0.01) and gait (P < 0.001) items on the UPDRS largely accounted for this deterioration.

The present study investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of aripiprazole and haloperidol compared with placebo.; A 4-week, double-blind, randomized study, conducted at 36 U.S. centers between July 1997 and June 1998, compared aripiprazole (15 mg/day, 30 mg/day) to placebo, with haloperidol (10 mg/day) as an active control. Fixed doses of each agent were administered from day 1 throughout the study. A total of 414 patients with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomized. Efficacy measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, PANSS positive, PANSS negative, PANSS-derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) core, Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-Severity of Illness, and mean CGI-Improvement scores. Safety and tolerability evaluations included extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), weight gain, serum prolactin level, and QTc interval.; Both doses of aripiprazole and haloperidol, 10 mg, produced statistically significant (p < or = .05) improvements from baseline in PANSS total, PANSS positive, PANSS-derived BPRS core, and CGI-Severity scores and significantly lower CGI-Improvement scores at endpoint, compared with placebo. Aripiprazole, 15 mg, and haloperidol, 10 mg, significantly improved PANSS negative score compared with placebo. Both aripiprazole doses and haloperidol separated from placebo for PANSS total scores at week 2. Unlike haloperidol, aripiprazole was not associated with significant EPS or prolactin elevation at endpoint compared with placebo. There were no statistically significant differences in mean changes in body weight across the treatment groups versus placebo, and no patients receiving aripiprazole experienced clinically significant increases in QTc interval.; Aripiprazole, effective against positive and negative symptoms, is a safe and well-tolerated potential treatment for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.",I,4

Needs-based intervention was compared with specific preventive intervention comprising low-dose risperidone therapy (mean dosage, 1.3 mg/d) and cognitive behavior therapy. Treatment was provided for 6 months, after which all patients were offered ongoing needs-based intervention.

The risks of augmentation strategies have not been studied systematically. No study has examined the economic impact of combination treatment.; Further trials of antipsychotic combination therapies are needed before this currently unsupported practice can be recommended.

This was achieved by a selected review of the relevant English-language literature published since 1966 through a Medline search and cross-referencing. Current scientific evidence for continuous maintenance therapy in schizophrenia was found equivocal as the randomization in clinical trials lumped together heterogeneous groups of patients, thereby creating a wide gap between research and clinical practice. In addition, the majority of studies took a narrow view of the concept of relapse. For these reasons, targeted intermittent treatment was probably prematurely discarded altogether. The rationale for use and optimal duration of maintenance antipsychotic pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia has not been adequately validated. The construct validity of outcome indicators currently used in maintenance treatment studies in schizophrenia should be reconsidered. Intermittent targeted treatment may represent a viable option in some clinical situations and warrant further evaluation. With the widespread use of atypical antipsychotics, current long-term maintenance strategies may need a reappraisal.",6,E

It identifies affected subpopulations and offers several interpretations of how observed patterns of use reflect outpatient prescribing practices.; This study used drug claims data from the Ontario Drug Benefit (ODB) program for the years 1992 to 1998. The use of antipsychotic agents was followed for 2 years in a subpopulation of ODB participants identified as consistent users of these agents (ie, those with evidence of > 1-time use).; During the study period, the total number of ODB claimants grew by 1%, the number of claimants using antipsychotic agents increased by approximately 25%, and the expenditure per claimant in this group increased by nearly 250%. Much of this growth in expenditures was associated with use of the newer atypical antipsychotic agents olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine. Compared with patients aged > or = 65 years, those aged < 65 years were more likely to receive an initial prescription for an atypical antipsychotic or be switched to an atypical antipsychotic. However, the proportion of patients aged > 85 years consistently using antipsychotic agents was greater than predicted based on the proportion of the ODB population they represent. These patients were more likely to use conventional antipsychotic agents exclusively.; The introduction of the atypical antipsychotic agents was paralleled by a striking increase in ODB expenditures for antipsychotic drugs, although use of these agents was not consistent across age groups. There was more switching to atypical antipsychotics, as well as greater use in general, among younger compared with older patients, despite evidence that the atypical antipsychotics may be safer in the elderly than conventional antipsychotics.

Common sleep disorders include excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder, night-time wakefulness and restless legs syndrome. A number of strategies may be used to improve sleep cycle disturbances, and often these interventions do not require pharmacological manipulation. Restoring traditional mealtimes and scheduling activities during predicted periods of sleepiness may help alleviate daytime somnolence; the use of controlled-release levodopa preparations or administration of a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor with levodopa at bedtime may reduce periods of night-time wakefulness. Administration of clonazepam at bedtime may assist with REM sleep behaviour disorder but, because this agent can result in daytime somnolence, experimentation with dosage times is recommended. Sleep attacks are described as a sudden, unavoidable transition from wakefulness to sleep and, although rare, have been described with pramipexole, ropinirole and other dopamine agonists. Although the condition has yet to be recognised by the International Association of Sleep Disorders, patients with PD who report rapid sleep onset should be evaluated for the possibility of sleep attacks. If sleep attacks are suspected, it is reasonable to strongly caution patients regarding potentially risk-associated activities such as driving, and to consider careful withdrawal of dopaminergic therapy.",5,E

However, the potential confounding effect of antipsychotic drugs on NAA has not been resolved. The few studies of antipsychotic-nai;ve patients are inconclusive. A recent report suggests that antipsychotic drugs may increase NAA in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We studied 10 minimally treated (less than 3 weeks lifetime exposure) schizophrenia patients and 10 normal controls with single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of the left frontal and occipital lobes. Concentrations of NAA, Cho, and Cre were determined and corrected for the proportion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the voxel. Patients were treated in a randomized-controlled double-blind design with either haloperidol or quetiapine. 1H-MRS was repeated within a year. There were no differences in frontal or occipital NAA between patients and controls at baseline. However, frontal NAA was reduced in the schizophrenia group within the first year of treatment. Patients had a clear clinical response to treatment but changes in frontal NAA were not correlated with symptom improvement. The well-described reduced frontal NAA in schizophrenia may not be a trait of the illness but may represent medication effect or progression of the disease.",2,E

Olanzapine was administrated to nine patients with genetically confirmed HD in increasing doses until satisfactory clinical effect or the appearance of side effects. The patients were evaluated at baseline and after 14 days of treatment using the motor scale of the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS). The patients improved significantly in most subscores of the UHDRS, including fine motor tasks, although some patients needed a rather high dose (30 mg per day). No adverse effects were reported by the patents spontaneously or were observed directly by the investigator. High-dose olanzapine seems to be useful in choreatic HD patients. A double blind, placebo-controlled trial appears warranted to definitively establish the symptomatic value of olanzapine in HD.",4,E

Over two-thirds of these had mental illness, were older on admission and had lived longer in special hospital than their better-rehabilitated peers. Offending history was irrelevant to this. Most post-discharge institution time was in open psychiatric hospital, or back in special hospital, not in medium secure units or prison.; The hypothesis was not sustained, but fewer people never reached the community than before the mid-1980s. Atypical antipsychotics might reduce this number. We found no justification for a new tier of long-term medium secure units.",2,E

In addition, melperone shares the following with other atypical antipsychotic drugs: (1) effectiveness for ameliorating negative symptoms; (2) no prolactin elevation; and (3) effectiveness in the treatment of some patients with neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenia. Other atypical antipsychotic drugs have been reported to improve cognitive function. This study was performed to investigate the effect of melperone on cognitive function. Nineteen patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, including 11 neuroleptic-resistant patients, were treated with melperone for 6 weeks. A comprehensive neurocognitive test battery and psychopathological ratings (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, BPRS) were administered at baseline and after 6 weeks of melperone treatment. Treatment with melperone was associated with improvement in executive function, as measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)-Categories and WCST-Percent Perseveration. On the other hand, visuospatial manipulation, as measured by the Wechsler Intelligent Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) Maze, worsened during melperone treatment. There were no significant changes in other domains of cognition, i.e. verbal learning and memory, verbal working memory, verbal fluency and sustained attention. Scores of WCST-Categories and Perseveration at 6 weeks were predicted from the relevant cognitive test scores at baseline and the change in BPRS Total and Positive scores. These results suggest the usefulness of melperone for facilitating work and social function in patients with schizophrenia. The differences in the cognition-enhancing abilities between melperone and clozapine are discussed.",5,E

There were moderate improvements in verbal recall memory and visual memory and processing speed, with smaller changes in P50 and verbal recognition memory. There was no effect on an attention measure. There were no changes in either positive or negative symptoms.

However, its receptor occupancy, in vitro and in vivo, and its effects in pre-clinical models are very similar to atypical antipsychotics. To examine if this leads to an atypical antipsychotic effect in the clinical context, the authors examined the antipsychotic and side-effect profile of amoxapine in acutely psychotic patients with schizophrenia.; Seventeen patients were enrolled and 15 completed a prospective open-label 6-week study of amoxapine starting with a fixed-starting dose (150 mg/h) with standardized titration up to 250 mg/h, if required. Positive, negative, affective symptoms and side-effects were monitored using standardized weekly assessments.; Amoxapine (median final dose 210 mg/h) was well-tolerated and showed significant improvement in positive and negative symptoms (both p<0.001), with a trend towards improvement in mood symptoms and no treatment-emergent extrapyramidal side-effects, akathisia or weight gain. Prolactin elevation was observed.; These clinical data lend support to the pre-clinical suggestions that amoxapine may be an atypical antipsychotic. Given its lack of weight gain and that it is considerably less expensive than current options, amoxapine could be a valuable alternative for some patients. These considerations strongly call for more systematic, double-blind studies of amoxapine as an atypical antipsychotic.",3,E

Weight and glucose, and lipid laboratory values were measured at the baseline and throughout the double-blind and year-long study. There were significant increases in serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and glucose levels during the course of clozapine treatment.

Propranolol and atenolol had additive effects on changes in the total cholesterol and triglycerides, with propranolol having the most pronounced effects. Propranolol and atenolol had no significant effect on the serum glucose levels. There were significant correlations between the triglyceride and HDL level changes and clozapine-associated weight gain during the study. There were no significant correlations between the change in serum total cholesterol, LDL, or glucose and weight gain. Clozapine therapy has adverse effects on glucose and lipid homeostasis, with clozapine-induced changes in serum glucose likely due to the inherent pharmacological properties of clozapine.

This paper presents the results of a study of the comparability of the results of cognitive assessments in different English-speaking countries and a number of countries where tests were translated into other languages. Performance on tests of executive functioning, verbal and visuo-spatial learning and memory, language skills, psychomotor speed, and vigilance was compared across the first episode patients with schizophrenia (n = 301) assessed in six different languages (English, French, Finnish, German, Hebrew, and Afrikaans), including two different countries where patients were assessed in English and other languages: Canada (French) and South Africa (Afrikaans). The variance in performance across the sites tested in English was as large as the variance between English and non-English speakers when all tests were considered. Performance differences across English and other languages were found only for executive functions, vigilance, and psychomotor speed, with executive functioning differences nonsignificant when education was considered. No differences were found between English and non-English speakers in Canada. These results suggest that the translation of tests of memory and verbal skills can lead to consistent results across translated versions of the tests. Differences between countries were greater than differences between languages, suggesting the need to consider representativeness of patient samples in terms of local educational attainment. In general, these data support the validity of cross-national neuropsychological assessments.",5,E

The goal of this study is to compare the effects of novel antipsychotics clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine and typical antipsychotics haloperidol and fluphenazine on glucose and lipid levels.; The charts of 590 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Of those, 215 patients had adequate laboratory data for inclusion. Glucose and lipid level data from 2 1/2 years before and after initiation of the target antipsychotic were included. Covariates, including patients' age, the duration of antipsychotic treatment, other medications that may affect glucose or lipid levels, and the initial laboratory values, were controlled for in the analyses.; Glucose levels were increased from baseline for patients treated with clozapine, olanzapine, and haloperidol. There were statistically and clinically significant differences among the medications' effects on lipid profiles (p < .05). Those receiving clozapine and olanzapine demonstrated statistically significant increases in triglyceride levels compared with the other groups. Over one third of patients treated with any of the novel antipsychotics had clinically meaningful triglyceride elevations.; It has been shown that novel antipsychotics are associated with weight gain. This risk factor along with others, such as elevated glucose and triglyceride levels, compounds the risk for coronary artery disease. Routine monitoring of glucose and lipid levels during treatment with novel antipsychotics should be advocated.",I,2

Adherence to pharmacotherapy can have a significant impact on drug response, especially in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. Previous studies evaluating antipsychotics identified schizophrenic individuals with poor pharmacotherapy adherence as having a higher risk of rehospitalization. Other investigators have shown a relationship between pattern of taking selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and probability of a positive outcome. Therefore, it is important to measure adherence patterns in clinical trials evaluating these treatments and to incorporate this information into the research findings.; Two multisite trials with atypical antipsychotics and antidepressants were simulated to evaluate, by use of population pharmacokinetic methods, the impact of electronic monitoring on measuring consistency of exposure to pharmacotherapy. One of the trials is ongoing and evaluates exposure to atypical antipsychotics, and the other is a proposed trial that examines exposure to an SSRI.; Erratic exposure patterns were detected with population pharmacokinetic techniques in the absence of Electronic Medication Event Monitoring (MEMS) data. In our simulations, the use of electronic monitoring improved the identification of atypical exposure by population pharmacokinetics both for the atypical antipsychotics and SSRIs.; Our simulations demonstrate the potential usefulness of the combination of population pharmacokinetics with electronic monitoring as a robust method for accurately and precisely capturing both magnitude and consistency of pharmacotherapy exposure.",5,E

We tested whether risperidone was associated with greater improvements than haloperidol in activities of daily living (ADLs) among persons having treatment-refractory schizophrenia. In a double-blind, controlled trial of fixed and flexible doses of haloperidol and risperidone, changes in ADLs were operationally monitored on a behavior therapy unit of a state hospital. While no differential effects were noted between risperidone and haloperidol in ADLS, these self-care skills significantly improved as subjects spent longer times on the behavior therapy unit. Working memory and verbal learning did correlate with improvements in ADLs, independent of drug condition. The contingencies of reinforcement and specific training programs on the behavior therapy unit may have been prepotent for the learning of ADLs, obscuring any differential impact of risperidone. Moreover, ADLs may be governed more by ""procedural"" learning than by working memory or verbal learning, with the former not differentially influenced by typical verus atypical antipsychotics.",I,4

We treated patients experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia with a single daily dose of quetiapine to achieve a transient daily peak of D(2) receptor blockade, to determine if this would lead to an antipsychotic response.; Fourteen patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorder were treated with quetiapine titrated to a single daily dose (mean +/- SD dose at the time of the positron emission tomography [PET] scan = 427 +/- 69 mg) for 12 weeks. Peak D(2) occupancy approximately 2 hours postdose and trough D(2) occupancy approximately 20 hours postdose were determined using PET and [(11)C]raclopride. Clinical symptoms and side effects were measured at baseline and every 2 weeks during the treatment phase.; Quetiapine administration led to a mean peak D(2) occupancy of 62% +/- 10% 2 hours postdose, which declined to 14% +/- 8% approximately 20 hours postdose. Ten (71%) of 14 patients responded to treatment with quetiapine, scoring ""much improved"" or greater on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale. Plasma drug levels and peak D(2) occupancy were highly correlated (r = 0.84; p =.003), as were prolactin and plasma drug levels when measured 2.5 hours after drug administration (r = 0.60; p <.05).

The effects of different AMI doses on five different symptom dimensions of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were analyzed. Results on global efficacy and safety parameters have been previously published. Four AMI doses (100 mg/day [AMI100], 400 mg/day [AMI400], 800 mg/day [AMI800], 1200 mg/day) were compared with 16 mg haloperidol (HAL16) in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, 4-week trial. A total of 319 patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) were included. AMI100 was compared with the other AMI doses, and HAL16 was compared with all AMI dosage groups. Response on BPRS factors defined as > or = 40% improvement and ORs were computed. An optimal AMI dose was calculated for each BPRS factor based on linear and quadratic regression. For all BPRS factors, inverted u-shaped dose-response curves emerged (r2 > 95%). The estimated AMI dose optimum for the BPRS factors activation/ agitation (760 mg), thought disturbances (716 mg), and hostility/suspiciousness (694 mg) was higher than that for anergia/negative symptoms (584 mg) and depression/anxiety (672 mg). Significant differences (p < 0.05) were found for AMI400/800 versus AMI100 (thought disturbances, hostility/ suspiciousness), for AMI400/800 versus HAL16 (depression/anxiety, thought disturbances, hostility/suspiciousness), and for AMI400 versus HAL16 (anergia/negative symptoms). ORs for response of the BPRS factors depression/anxiety, anergia/negative symptoms, and hostility/suspiciousness were highest under treatment with AMI400 compared to AMI100 and HAL16. For the BPRS factors thought disturbances and activation/agitation, the highest response chance emerged under AMI800 compared to AMI100 or HAL16. AMI seems to show the best clinical efficacy in acutely schizophrenic patients in a moderate dose (400-800 mg/day), with a somewhat lower dose optimum for negative than for positive symptoms. The present finding of distinct dose-response relationships of AMI regarding the BPRS dimensions is in accordance with studies on the mechanism of action of AMI and provides a useful rationale for the clinical treatment of schizophrenic patients with AMI.",3,E

It was hypothesised that, since the ability to make inferences about the environment and about other peoples' mental states is a key ingredient of social competence, the assessment of ToM would correlate more strongly with current social functioning than with more traditional neurocognitive measures. 'Independent raters' assessed Theory of Mind, neurocognitive and clinical variables as well as community functioning in 44 subjects with schizophrenia. The neuropsychological measures were more closely associated with community functioning than with psychiatric symptoms. These associations remained evident when the effects of intelligence were controlled. Patients with a higher level of competence in making social inferences had better overall community functioning than those who showed less ability in this aspect of social cognition. In a regression model, the capacity to comprehend other people's mental states (ToM-2) was among the best predictors of global social functioning, together with recent onset of illness, good verbal fluency and low levels of negative and positive symptoms. These results are consistent with other recent findings. ToM measures of social cognition may be a useful addition to neuropsychological assessment when developing programmes for reducing clinical impairments and improving the community functioning of subjects with schizophrenic disorders. Further studies are needed to verify the value of these measures as predictors of the successful application of specific psychosocial rehabilitation strategies.",5,E

These benefits have the potential to improve compliance and reduce relapse rates. The model showed that the higher acquisition cost of quetiapine was offset by lower costs for other medications, hospitalization, and other medical services. The total treatment cost over 5 years was 38,106 pounds for quetiapine and 38,350 pounds for haloperidol, a cost saving of 244 pounds in favor of quetiapine. Quetiapine-treated patients also spent longer in response states and experienced fewer relapses. Sensitivity analysis showed these results to be robust across a range of conditions.; Quetiapine has the potential to improve outcomes compared with haloperidol in partial responders with schizophrenia, at a slightly lower total cost. The higher acquisition cost of quetiapine was offset by savings in other medical costs.

Traditional treatments for BPSD are neuroleptics and sedatives, which are not devoid of serious adverse effects. A number of studies show beneficial effects in the treatment of BPSD with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI). The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of donepezil (using the generic drug Memorit) as monotherapy for AD patients suffering from BPSD. Twenty-eight consecutive patients followed at the Memory Outpatient Clinic and Psychogeriatric Department of the Abarbanel Mental Health Center were treated with donepezil for 6 months. Starting dose was 5 mg daily during the first 4 weeks and continuation with 10 mg daily thereafter. Treatment effects were evaluated using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Clinical Global Impression of Change Scale (CGIC) caregiver version. Twenty-four of 28 patients completed the study. Of these, five patients needed additional rescue neuroleptic treatment due to incomplete response. The mean dose of donepezil was 9.10 mg/day (median 10 mg/day). The overall NPI improved significantly from 33.4 to 21.2 (p = 0.008). The mean CGIC at study's end was 3.0 (mild improvement). The cognitive scores did not change significantly. When compared to the patients who completed the study, patients who discontinued had higher mean scores on the irritability and agitation subscales of the NPI, they were older, and they had longer disease duration and lower MMSE mean scores. Three adverse events were recorded: one syncope causing a toe phalanx fracture and gastrointestinal complaints that resolved over time in two additional patients. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors should be considered for the treatment of BPSD before neuroleptic treatment is instituted in AD patients with low levels of irritability and agitation.",3,E

Aripiprazole exhibits typical antagonism at dopamine (D2) receptors in the mesolimbic pathway, as well as having unique partial agonist activity at D2 receptors in the mesocortical pathway. As exemplified by other atypical antipsychotics, it displays strong 5-HT(2a) receptor antagonism and is similar to ziprasidone in also having agonistic activity at the 5-HT(1a) receptor. Among the atypical antipsychotics, aripiprazole displays the lowest affinity for alpha(1)adrenergic (alpha(1)), histamine (H1) and muscarinic (M1) receptors. This combination of effects may be responsible for its efficacy in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and in bipolar disorder. Similarly, this profile may be the reason for the low rates of reported side effects observed. This includes general adverse events, a low incidence of reported weight gain and a low liability for inducing movement disorders. Other early data suggest that aripiprazole may induce reductions in plasma prolactin, as well as in plasma glucose and lipid profiles. Finally, results also support the proposition that aripiprazole may lead to reductions in corrected QT interval and have minimal drug interactions.",5,E

Given the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, the dysregulation of IL-12 in these illnesses would be expected. We measured the plasma levels of IL-12 in 102 psychiatric patients (43 schizophrenia, 34 major depression and 25 bipolar disorder) and 85 normal controls. In addition, IL-12 levels of the patients were measured after an 8-week treatment to assess whether the levels were affected by medication. The IL-12 levels of the patient group with major depression were significantly higher than that of the control group, whereas no differences were found among the other groups. IL-12 values of the three patient groups decreased significantly after 8 weeks of treatment. These findings support the hypothesis that activation of the inflammatory response system and in particular of Th-1-like cells, is involved in the pathophysiology of major depression and that repeated administration of antidepressive and antipsychotic drugs may suppress IL-12 plasma concentrations in psychiatric patients.",2,E

This preliminary study examined the potential efficacy of risperidone in treating psychotic symptoms associated with chronic PTSD. In a 5-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adjunctive risperidone treatment was assessed in 40 combat veterans with chronic PTSD and comorbid psychotic features. Most patients were receiving antidepressants and some other psychotics with doses of concurrent medications held constant for at least 1 month prior to and during the study. Thirty-seven patients completed at least 1 week of treatment with risperidone or placebo. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) were used to assess symptoms. The PANSS was the primary outcome measure. At treatment endpoint, risperidone-treated patients showed a significantly greater decrease from baseline, albeit modest, in psychotic symptoms (PANSS total scores) than placebo-treated patients (P < 0.05). CAPS ratings declined significantly in both groups but did not differ significantly between groups. However, CAPS re-experiencing subscale scores had greater improvement in the risperidone-treated patients at week 5 (P < 0.05, completer analysis) with a trend towards greater improvement versus placebo a endpoint (P < 0.1, LOCF). Risperidone was well tolerated with minimal extrapyramidal symptoms. These preliminary results support studying the potential efficacy of risperidone for treating global psychotic symptoms associated with chronic PTSD with a suggestion that core re-experiencing symptoms may also be responsive. Further research using randomized, controlled trial designs in larger patient groups are needed to define more adequately the role of risperidone and other atypical agents in PTSD.",4,E

EPS measurements used in Western countries included the Simpson-Angus, Barnes akathisia and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, while the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptom Scale (DIEPSS) was used in Japan. The aim of this study was to clarify how the DIEPSS captures EPS profiles. The baseline prevalence and treatment-emergent incidence of EPS in Japanese schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine or haloperidol were retrospectively compared as assessed by the DIEPSS to the prevalence and incidence of EPS in primarily Caucasian schizophrenic patients who were treated with olanzapine or haloperidol. Specifically, the prevalence and incidence of dyskinesia, akathisia and parkinsonism were compared between the Japanese trial and an international trial to examine if appropriate definitions using the DIEPSS can be derived assuming that a comparable prevalence and incidence of the syndromes would be observed when any differences in residual antipsychotic exposure at the initiation of study treatment were accounted for. For the incidence of all EPS syndromes, odds ratios were observed to be similar between the two studies, indicating that appropriate criteria for the clinical diagnosis of the EPS syndromes could be established based on the DIEPSS. This preliminary and retrospective work suggests that the DIEPSS can be used to operationally define the presence or absence, and make the clinical diagnosis, of specific EPS syndromes.",I,5

Therefore, it is of great importance to identify factors that moderate response to placebo in such trials.; The objective of this meta-regression analysis was to estimate the effect of potential moderators of placebo response in randomized, short-term clinical trials involving patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or schizophreniform disorder.; Mean placebo response and potential moderators were extracted from 35 placebo-controlled, randomized trials of antipsychotic medications in patients with schizophrenia. Placebo response was defined as the absolute change in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score. Fixed-effects meta-regression was used to investigate between-trial variation in placebo response.; Trial duration accounted for a substantial proportion of the between-trial variation in response (27%), with greater improvement on placebo observed in shorter trials. Other variables showed insufficient variation across trials to permit any inferences regarding their relationships with placebo response.; Placebo-controlled trials of short duration (<6-8 weeks) are vulnerable to substantial placebo response. Recruiting patients with more severe pathology to mitigate placebo response does not appear to offer benefits and may even be counterproductive. Meta-analyses based on individual patient data offer the potential for much more detailed and inferentially sound exploration of factors affecting placebo response and are highly recommended.",5,E

Divalproex was initiated at 15 mg/kg/day and titrated over 12 days to a maximum dosage of 30 mg/kg/day. Olanzapine and risperidone, were, respectively, initiated at 5 and 2 mg/day and were titrated over the first 6 days to respective target fixed daily dosages of 15 and 6 mg/day.

Recently, thioridazine has been subjected to a restricted indications notice and sertindole had its license withdrawn because of concerns about their potential cardiotoxicity. In the development of new atypical agents, heart-rate corrected QT effects are evaluated but it is unclear how predictive these are of clinically significant cardiotoxicity or sudden death. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a potential index of cardiotoxicity which has been found to be decreased following antidepressants and clozapine. We studied acute HRV changes following antipsychotic agents. Sixteen healthy male volunteers received risperidone (4 mg), olanzapine (10 mg), thioridazine (50 mg) or placebo in a randomized cross-over design. Subjective effects and psychomotor function were assayed at 2 h and both linear (summary statistics) and non-linear (scatterplot) measures of HRV were evaluated by continuous electrocardiogram recording over 10 h. Differential effects of single doses of the three antipsychotic drugs on HRV were found, and these were independent of their sedative effects. Olanzapine increased, and thioridazine decreased HRV, while risperidone had no effect. HRV is sensitive to the acute effects of antipsychotics. It may prove to be a reliable index of their potential for cardiotoxicity. Further studies in both healthy volunteers and patients on antipsychotic medication will be valuable.",4,E

12504069,Efficacy of newer generation antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia.,Antipsychotic Agents; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology,"Tandon, R; Jibson, M D","The advent of the newer 'atypical' antipsychotic medications has revolutionized the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. In contrast to the older conventional antipsychotic agents, atypical medications have a broader spectrum of efficacy (greater efficacy in negative, cognitive, and mood symptoms) and a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia. Due to concerns surrounding hematological safety and other adverse effects, clozapine is used principally in patients refractory to treatment with other antipsychotic agents. The other three universally available atypical agents (risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) collectively constitute about 70% of all antipsychotic prescriptions in the USA. Despite the broad popularity of these medications and their rapid adoption in general clinical practice, there are limited data on how they compare to each other with regards to their overall efficacy and also as to their efficacy in specific symptom domains. To address this question, two separate analyses were undertaken. First, all published, short-term, randomized, controlled clinical trials of these agents in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were reviewed and the extent of improvement across these agents was compared. While the amount of improvement with a particular agent across its different studies varied, the average improvement was similar for the agents for all efficacy parameters considered. Secondly, all randomized, controlled clinical trials directly comparing two or more of these agents in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were analyzed. Only three such trials (all industry sponsored) were identified; while there were differences in methodology and small differences in efficacy on a minority of measures on which comparisons were undertaken, the preponderance of data suggested no differences in efficacy. While data thus far do not support assertions of differential efficacy between risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine, there are clear differences in their side-effect profiles and these are briefly summarized.",5,E

This study explored whether the difference in clinical efficacy and safety between atypical antipsychotics and conventional neuroleptics results in decreases in use and cost of medical services in Mexico, offsetting the higher price of atypical antipsychotics.; A U.S. decision analytic Markov model was adapted for use in Mexico to determine cost-effectiveness of treatments and outcomes that Mexican patients with schizophrenia may experience over a 5-year period when treated with olanzapine, haloperidol, or risperidone. Model parameter estimates were based on clinical trial data, published medical literature, and where needed, clinician judgment. Direct medical costs were incorporated into the model and outcomes were estimated using lack of relapse and clinical outcomes based on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) as effectiveness indicators. All costs are reported in Mexican pesos.; Over a 5-year period, the cost of treating schizophrenia ranged from 196,620 pesos per patient initiating therapy with haloperidol to 226,670 pesos per patient beginning therapy with risperidone. Olanzapine was estimated to have slightly better non-relapse and BPRS-based effectiveness outcomes, but comparative total medical costs compared to risperidone. Patients receiving olanzapine experienced 13 and 2% fewer relapses compared with patients on haloperidol and risperidone, respectively. The 5-year incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of olanzapine compared with haloperidol was 52,740 pesos per improved patient, BPRS-based outcome and 212,540 pesos per avoided relapse. Sensitivity analyses indicated the model was sensitive only to changes in drug costs.; Compared with haloperidol, olanzapine therapy results in improved symptoms, fewer relapses, and is cost-effective, even with conservative values for key model parameters. Olanzapine results in slightly improved patient outcomes and comparable costs compared with risperidone.",5,E

Data on this topic is sparse and often inconsistent. To our knowledge, these are the first personally followed patients over the long term, dealing directly with the issue of the duration of the RC course.; We examined the evolution of the course of 109 RC patients (68 women and 41 men) followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 36 years, beginning with the index episode when the RC course was diagnosed by the authors (A.K., G.P.M., P.G., L.P., D.R.). Patients were included in the study if they met criteria for RC as defined by>or=4 affective episodes per year (Dunner and Fieve, 1974). The follow-up period varied from 2-5 years for 25 patients, 6-10 years for 24 patients, 11-15 years for 24 patients, 16-20 years for 19 patients, 21-25 years for 13 patients, 30-36 years for four patients.; In 13 patients (12%), RC emerged spontaneously and in 96 patients (88%), it was associated with antidepressant and other treatments. In 19 women (28% of all women) RC course started in perimenopausal age (45-54 years). The mean duration of RC during the follow-up period was 7.86 years (range 1-32) and its total duration (including RC course prior to the follow-up period) was 11 years (range 1-40). The total duration of the affective disorder, from the first episode to the end of the follow-up, was 21.78 years (range 1-70). At the end of the follow-up, 36 patients (33%) had complete remission for at least the past year, 44 (40%) stayed rapid cycling with severe episodes (six of this group committed suicide), while 15 (14%) were rapid cycling but with attenuated episodes. The other 14 patients (13%) became long cyclers, eight with severe episodes and six with milder ones. The main distinguishing features between those who remitted from and those who persisted in the RC course were: (1). the initial cycle pattern: patients with Depression-Hypomania(mania)-Free interval cycles (53 patients) had a worse outcome: 26.4% remitted and 52.8% persisted in the RC course through to the end of the follow up period. The Mania/Hypomania-Depression-Free interval cycles (22 patients) had a significantly better outcome, with 50% remitted and 27.2% persisting RC; and (2). the occurrence of the switch process from depression to hypomania/mania and the occurrence of agitated depressions made the prognosis worse. Continuous treatment was more effective against mania/hypomania than against depression, yet in all persisting RC cases the mania/hypomania remitted only partially.; These data derive from clinics known for their expertise in mood disorders, and they may have attracted and retained patients with a more severe course. Treatment was uncontrolled and consisted more of lithium than divalproex, lamotrigene and olanzapine, recently shown to be beneficial in subgroups of patients with rapid-cycling.; Our findings suggest that rapid cyclicity, spontaneous or induced, once established, becomes for many years a stable rhythm in a substantial proportion of patients, linked to endogenous and environmental factors. The suggestion is made to consider as rapid-cyclers, at least for research purposes, those patients who have had a rapid cycling course for at least 2 years, borrowing the duration criterion currently employed for other chronic disorders such as Dysthymia and Cyclothymia. That our patients had poorer prognosis than some other cohorts in the literature is probably due to the shorter duration of ""rapid-cycling"" at entry in the latter cohorts. A true understanding of the nature of rapid-cycling will require a rigorous definition of not only duration, but also pole-switching and course patterns at entry into study.",3,E

To date, such reports are from uncontrolled clinical experience and therefore cannot clarify whether the atypical antipsychotics caused such manic-like states or simply failed to prevent them. Presumably, bipolar patients would be at increased risk for this putative adverse event. Therefore, we evaluated the potential of olanzapine to exacerbate symptoms of mania compared to placebo during treatment of bipolar mania.; Two inpatient, double-blind, randomized trials investigating the efficacy of olanzapine 5-20 mg daily versus placebo for the treatment of acute mania were combined. Two hundred and fifty-four subjects participated (placebo n=129; olanzapine n=125) in the two studies. Severity of mania was quantified with the 11-item Young-Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS). In a post-hoc analysis, after double-blind therapy up to 3 weeks, categorical comparison of olanzapine and placebo groups was made for any worsening and worsening by 10 or 20% from baseline Y-MRS scores (LOCF).; The percentage of subjects with exacerbation at endpoint were: any worsening, placebo 37.7%, olanzapine 21.8% (P=0.005); >or=10% worsening, placebo 24.6%, olanzapine 14.5% (P=0.039); >or=20% worsening, placebo 15.6%, olanzapine 8.1% (P=0.064).; Mania rating scores worsened for some patients during olanzapine therapy. However, this was significantly less common with olanzapine than with placebo.

No patients discontinued due to an adverse event.; The duration of this study was limited to 3 weeks, precluding conclusions about long-term efficacy of olanzapine. Moreover, a sizeable placebo effect was obtained, possibly masking optimal therapeutic effect. Despite these limitations, treatment differences in efficacy were highly significant.; These results indicate that olanzapine was effective in reducing symptoms of mania and well tolerated in patients with bipolar I disorder with a rapid-cycling course.",I,I

The application of single photon emission tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) techniques to the study of psychiatric illness has lead to increased understanding of disease processes as well as validated, in vivo, theories of illness etiology. Within the field of psychiatry these techniques have been applied most widely to the study of schizophrenia. Studies within schizophrenia are largely limited to either the dopamine or serotonin system. This is due in large part to the availability of suitable radiotracers as well as the current theories on the etiology of the illness. Two basic study designs are used when studying schizophrenia using molecular imaging and make up the majority of studies reviewed in this manuscript. The first type, termed ""clinical studies,"" compares the findings from PET and SPECT studies in those with schizophrenia to normal controls in an attempt to understand the pathophysiology of the illness. The second study design, termed ""occupancy studies,"" uses these techniques to enhance the understanding of the mechanism of action of the medications used in treating this illness. This review will focus on the findings of molecular imaging studies in schizophrenia, focusing, for the most part, on the serotonin and dopamine systems. Emphasis will be placed on how these findings and techniques are currently being used to inform the development of novel treatments for schizophrenia.",5,E

Study results suggest that clozapine therapy significantly reduces suicidal behavior in these patients.; A multicenter, randomized, international, 2-year study comparing the risk for suicidal behavior in patients treated with clozapine vs olanzapine was conducted in 980 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 26.8% of whom were refractory to previous treatment, who were considered at high risk for suicide because of previous suicide attempts or current suicidal ideation. To equalize clinical contact across treatments, all patients were seen weekly for 6 months and then biweekly for 18 months. Subsequent to randomization, unmasked clinicians at each site could make any interventions necessary to prevent the occurrence of suicide attempts. Suicidal behavior was assessed at each visit. Primary end points included suicide attempts (including those that led to death), hospitalizations to prevent suicide, and a rating of ""much worsening of suicidality"" from baseline. Masked raters, including an independent suicide monitoring board, determined when end point criteria were achieved.; Suicidal behavior was significantly less in patients treated with clozapine vs olanzapine (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.97; P =.03). Fewer clozapine-treated patients attempted suicide (34 vs 55; P =.03), required hospitalizations (82 vs 107; P =.05) or rescue interventions (118 vs 155; P =.01) to prevent suicide, or required concomitant treatment with antidepressants (221 vs 258; P =.01) or anxiolytics or soporifics (301 vs 331; P =.03). Overall, few of these high-risk patients died of suicide during the study (5 clozapine vs 3 olanzapine-treated patients; P =.73).; Clozapine therapy demonstrated superiority to olanzapine therapy in preventing suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder at high risk for suicide. Use of clozapine in this population should lead to a significant reduction in suicidal behavior.",I,I

Information on sociodemographic and clinical variables, current psychotropic drug use, side-effects and past use of typical drugs was collected. In addition, patient symptoms and functional status were evaluated by the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale. Patients receiving off-label prescribing of second-generation antipsychotics were identified. A total of 209 patients were collected. In comparison with patients receiving other second-generation antipsychotics, living in residential facilities, unemployment, long psychiatric histories, and problems with activities of daily living and living conditions were more common in clozapine-treated patients. Nearly 80 % of patients receiving clozapine had schizophrenia compared to less than 50 % of those receiving other second-generation antipsychotics. Overall, 109 patients (52 %) received off-label prescriptions of second-generation antipsychotic drugs. This survey indicates that clozapine was mostly reserved for severe cases and poor responders; the high rate of off-label prescriptions highlights the gap existing between recommendations derived from randomised clinical trials and the current use of drugs.",5,E

Therefore, treatments that stabilize mood and decrease drug use or cravings are of great interest. Atypical antipsychotics are in widespread use in patients with bipolar disorder. However, minimal data are available on their use in bipolar patients with comorbid substance abuse.; Open-label, add-on, quetiapine therapy was examined for 12 weeks in 17 outpatients with bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence. Subjects were evaluated with a structured clinical interview; Hamilton Depression Rating (HDRS), Young Mania Rating (YMRS), Brief Psychiatric Rating (BPRS) scales; and Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (CCQ). Urine samples and self-reported drug use were also obtained. Data were analyzed using a last observation carried forward method on all subjects given medication at baseline.; Significant improvement from baseline to exit was observed in HDRS, YMRS, BPRS and CCQ scores (p < or = 0.05). Dollars spent on cocaine and days/week of cocaine use decreased non-significantly, and urine drug screens did not change significantly from baseline to exit. Quetiapine was well tolerated, with no subjects to our knowledge discontinuing because of side-effects.; The use of quetiapine was associated with substantial improvement in psychiatric symptoms and cocaine cravings. The findings are promising and suggest larger controlled trials of quetiapine are needed in this population.",6,E

After an inpatient period of up to 21 days, subjects were followed as outpatients. Dose adjustment was permitted during the inpatient period. Efficacy was assessed using change from baseline in Mania Rating Scale (MRS) score to day 21; other efficacy measures included the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Clinical Global Impressions-Part I, Severity of Illness scale. The primary safety endpoint was change from baseline in weight. Other safety and tolerability endpoints included spontaneous adverse event reporting and changes from baseline in laboratory measures and vital signs.; 120 subjects (N = 63 divalproex, N = 57 olanzapine) were randomly assigned to treatment. No significant differences between groups were found for any efficacy variable for change from baseline to day 21.

Antipsychotic medications in these individuals may be associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), worsening of depression, and functional impairment. Atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine and risperidone are associated with a decreased incidence of adverse events such as EPS. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine and risperidone for the treatment of depressive symptoms in outpatients with psychosis.; In this 4-month, multicenter, open-label trial, patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio of quetiapine to risperidone, and both drugs were flexibly dosed. Eligible patients had psychoses and demonstrated 1 of several DSM-IV diagnoses, including schizoaffective disorder, bipolar I disorder, major depressive disorder, delusional disorder, Alzheimer's dementia, schizophreniform disorder, vascular dementia, and substance abuse dementia. Patients were classified as mood disordered if they had bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. Efficacy was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions scale. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) was used to assess the level of depressive symptoms. The primary tolerability assessment was presence or absence of substantial EPS, defined as EPS severe enough to require an alteration in treatment.; A total of 554 patients were randomly assigned to quetiapine and 175 to risperidone. Mean doses at 16 weeks were 318 mg for quetiapine and 4.4 mg for risperidone. Although both agents produced improvements in mean HAM-D scores, quetiapine produced a greater improvement than risperidone in all patients (p =.0015). Within the mood-diagnosed population, incidences of both substantial EPS (p =.001) and at least moderate EPS (p =.0373) occurred significantly less frequently among patients taking quetiapine. For patients with non-mood diagnoses, incidences of substantial EPS were fewer for patients taking quetiapine than for those taking risperidone (p =.062); however, this was not statistically significant.; These results suggest that quetiapine may be a useful agent in the management of depressive symptoms in patients with psychosis.",I,I

Individuals with dominating disturbance of perception, thinking and cognition were basically diagnosed having schizophrenic. Individuals with mood disturbance were basically diagnosed having affective disorders. However, there were patients who did not fit neatly into either category. In 1933 Jocob Kasanin introduced the term ""schizoaffective psychosis"". Scientific discussions involved the possibility that schizoaffective disorder was conceptualized most accurately as following: a type of schizophrenia, a type of affective disorder, a unique disorder that was separate from both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an arbitrary categorization of clinical symptoms that marked a continuum between schizophrenia and affective illness, a heterogeneous collection of ""interforms"" between schizophrenia and affective disorders. However, diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is included both in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10. Schizoaffective disorder is listed in the category ""schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders"". The differential diagnosis includes basically either schizophrenia or affective disorder. The epidemiological status of schizoaffective disorder is somewhat uncertain compared with schizophrenia because of dilemmas related to diagnosis and classification of the disorder. Treatment of schizoaffective disorder comprises psychotropic medication, supportive psychotherapy, social care, rehabilitation. The most important groups of psychotropic medications are: antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood stabilizers. Atypical antipsychotics are the first-line medication for schizoaffective disorder due to their pharmacological properties. In the case of schizoaffective disorders combination of atypical antipsychotics with antidepressants seems to be useful. Novel antidepressants have priority for the combination mentioned above. Peculiarities of mechanism of action of antidepressant are important for combinations. Mood stabilizers seem to be useful for treatment of certain type of schizoaffective disorder as well.",1,E

Based on current population projections it has been estimated that by 2050 the number of individuals over 65 will increase to 1.1 billion worldwide and as a consequence, the number of cases of dementia to 37 million. Faced with such an enormous public health and socio-economic burden it is evident that the importance of therapeutic intervention aimed at either finding a cure or preventing disease progression cannot be overstated. The aim of the present paper is to present an overview, in the context of a brain aging continuum, at what stage cognition enhancing and/or neuroprotective intervention strategies aimed at stabilising and/or preventing neurodegenerative disease could demonstrate potential clinical benefit. In particular, the clinical identification of patients with mild cognitive impairment and age-associated memory impairment which may represent a 'transition' state between normal aging and dementia is discussed as a potential clinical population cohort targeted for early intervention in dementia. Considering the wide spectrum of cognitive and psychotic effects in dementia juxtaposed with the neuropathological evolution of the disease, it is clear that a variety of therapeutic intervention(s) will be required in order, to at the least, stabilise disease progression. Evidently, since Alzheimer's disease is by far the most prevalent form of dementia, and will undoubtedly serve as the benchmark for any future treatment of dementia, an update of current symptomatic and disease-modifying therapeutic approaches (cholinergic, glutamatergic, nootropics, beta-amyloid cascade inhibitors) will be reviewed.",5,E

Secondary assessments of efficacy included the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Clinical Global Impression Scale. Safety and tolerability evaluations included neurologic ratings, vital signs, and assessment of treatment-emergent side effects. Eighteen of 20 patients enrolled in the study completed 6 weeks of open-label treatment. The dose range of quetiapine was 25 to 300 mg daily, with an average of 100+/-70 mg/d.

General psychopathology (PANSS) and depressive symptoms (HRSD) were also reduced at the 6-week end point. There were no serious adverse events and no clinically significant changes in vital signs or neurologic ratings. This preliminary open trial suggests that quetiapine is well tolerated and may have efficacy in reducing PTSD symptoms in patients who have not had an adequate response other medications.

The purpose of this study is to further examine the utility of bupropion sustained release (SR) augmentation in patients with inadequate response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients who met DSM-IV criteria for major depression and had failed to achieve adequate response to an SSRI were considered for this study. Eligible patients were required to have a score of 16 on the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Patients were treated openly for 6 weeks with bupropion SR added to their existing antidepressant. The dose range of bupropion was 150 to 300 mg per day. At each visit, patients were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Depression Ratings Scale (HDRS), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Twenty-eight patients (12 men, 16 women) entered the study. Twenty-five patients completed the six-week trial. With respect to the clinical benefit of bupropion SR augmentation, 15 out of 28, or 54% of patients, were classified as responders, showing a decrease in their HDRS or BDI scores of 50% or more between baseline and Week 6. This prospective, open-label trial supports the use of bupropion SR in the augmentation of SSRIs and venlafaxine.

The authors' goal was to assess the effects of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol on glucose and cholesterol levels in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder during a randomized double-blind 14-week trial.; One hundred fifty-seven patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were inpatients at four hospitals were originally included in the study. The 14-week trial consisted of an 8-week fixed-dose period and a 6-week variable-dose period. Planned assessments included fasting glucose and cholesterol, which were collected at baseline and at the end of the 8-week period and the following 6-week period.; One hundred eight of the 157 patients provided blood samples at baseline and at least at one point after random assignment to clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol during the treatment trial. Seven of these patients had diabetes; their glucose levels were >125 mg/dl at baseline. Data from 101 patients were used for statistical analyses. During the initial 8-week period there was an overall significant increase in mean glucose levels. There were significant increases in glucose levels at the end of the 8-week fixed-dose period for patients given clozapine (N=27) and those given haloperidol (N=25). The olanzapine group showed a significant increase of glucose levels at the end of the 6-week variable-dose period (N=22). Fourteen of the 101 patients developed abnormal glucose levels (>125 mg/dl) during the trial (six with clozapine, four with olanzapine, three with risperidone, and one with haloperidol). Cholesterol levels were increased at the end of the 8-week fixed-dose period for the patients given clozapine (N=27) and those given olanzapine (N=26); cholesterol levels were also increased at the end of the 6-week variable-dose period for patients given olanzapine (N=22).; In this prospective randomized trial, clozapine, olanzapine, and haloperidol were associated with an increase of plasma glucose level, and clozapine and olanzapine were associated with an increase in cholesterol levels. The mean changes in glucose and cholesterol levels remained within clinically normal ranges, but approximately 14% of the patients developed abnormally high glucose levels during the course of their participation in the study.",4,E

In addition, they sought preliminary evidence on whether subjective experience is better with low-dose olanzapine than with low-dose haloperidol.; Subjects (N=24) who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with either olanzapine, 7.5 mg/day, or haloperidol, 2.5 mg/day. Subjective experience, psychopathology, and extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed at baseline and at endpoint. After 6 weeks, D(2) receptor occupancy was assessed with [(123)I]iodobenzamide single photon emission computed tomography.; The two study groups were similar at baseline. After 6 weeks, patients receiving olanzapine had a significantly lower mean dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy (51.0%, range=36%-67%) than those given haloperidol (65.5%, range=45%-75%). Receptor occupancy between 60% and 70% was associated with optimal subjective experience, and subjective experience improved significantly in the haloperidol group.; A level of D(2) receptor occupancy between 60% and 70% is optimal for subjective experience of patients with recent-onset schizophrenia. Substantial interindividual variation in D(2) receptor occupancy was seen at fixed low-dose levels of olanzapine and haloperidol. Olanzapine, 7.5 mg/day, showed no superior subjective response over haloperidol, 2.5 mg/day.

Confusion, visual hallucinations, and psychosis are major dose-limiting factors for long-term dopaminergic management of PD. Classic neuroleptic agents exacerbate the motor symptoms of the disease. For this reason, the introduction of atypical antipsychotic drugs has been a major advancement for the management of psychosis in patients with PD. Of them, clozapine is one of the most effective. Thirty-two patients (mean age, 73 years; mean disease duration, 12.2 years) with PD and psychosis (DSM-IV), 14 of them with dementia (DSM-IV), were followed for 5 years with periodic clinical evaluation, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Parkinsonian Psychosis Rating Scale (PPRS) administered before and following the study (at least once in 6 months). Periodic blood count was performed for tracking neutropenia. Nineteen patients (8 with dementia) have continued to receive clozapine (mean daily dose, 50 mg). Thirteen patients stopped medication: 9 because symptoms improved and did not return after weaning off clozapine; 3 patients because of somnolence; and 1 because of personal reasons. The average duration of treatment in those in whom medication was stopped was 8.5 months (range, 1-24 months). No correlation was found between age, sex, duration, and severity of disease (Yahr scoring), the presence of dementia, and the response to clozapine. Also, the PPRS scoring did not influence clozapine response. No case of neutropenia was found. According to the experience accumulated and the results of the present study, the authors believe clozapine is the best therapeutic choice currently available for the management of psychosis in patients with PD.",4,E

12585015,Early intervention in schizophrenia: a critique.,Humans; Mental Health Services; Preventive Health Services; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Risk Assessment; Schizophrenia,"Warner, Richard","Two forms of early intervention in psychosis are currently being proposed--intervention before the onset of illness with at-risk individuals and intervention after the onset of psychosis.; The risks and potential benefits associated with these two approaches were examined using published data and Bayes probability theorem.; Claims for benefits from early intervention in established psychosis go back more than two hundred years to the nineteenth-century advocates for asylum construction. Theoretical support for early intervention in psychosis rests on data suggesting that a longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is associated with poor outcome. The association of DUP with outcome, however, appears to be inseparable from the confounding influence of the good outcome expected in recent-onset psychosis. Although some researchers advocate treating people with premorbid features of psychosis or other high-risk indicators, adequate screening measures and effective interventions are not yet available. The most promising current screening measure, if applied to the general population, would be accurate only two percent of the time. The accuracy of these measures can be improved by screening only those patients who are referred to a clinic, but this strategy will result in many cases in the population-at-large being overlooked.; The risks and potential benefits associated with the two early intervention approaches are very different. The provision of optimal treatment early in psychosis could produce benefits, but people with brief, good-prognosis psychotic episodes are likely to receive unnecessary treatment. Screening the general population or patients referred to a clinic will have little public health impact on the incidence of schizophrenia. There is likely to be considerable negative impact on those who are inaccurately labeled as being at imminent risk of psychosis and are treated accordingly.",5,E

The side effects associated with high prolactin levels can have a negative impact on patient compliance with treatment. Atypical antipsychotics as a group cause less hyperprolactinemia than conventional antipsychotics, yet there is considerable variation among specific drugs. Risperidone at higher doses has been shown to produce increases in prolactin similar to conventional antipsychotics. At the other end of the spectrum, clozapine and quetiapine produce minimal sustained increases in prolactin that are no different from placebo. However, correlations between prolactin elevations and clinical symptoms have not been well-established. This paper reviews the published literature regarding prolactin levels in treated and untreated patients with schizophrenia and the relationship of prolactin and dopamine. It concludes with an overview of the effects of specific atypical antipsychotics on prolactin levels in patients with schizophrenia.",5,E

Aripiprazole is a new atypical antipsychotic with a unique receptor binding profile that combines partial agonist activity at D2 and 5HT1A receptors with potent antagonism at 5HT2A receptors. Clinical studies in acute schizophrenic relapse, chronic schizophrenia and acute mania show it is robustly more effective than placebo. Once-daily aripiprazole 15-30 mg is as effective as haloperidol 10 mg/day and risperidone 6 mg/day in short-term treatment of schizophrenia and more effective than haloperidol 7-10 mg/day in maintenance of response in chronic schizophrenia. Aripiprazole appears to be well tolerated, with most studies suggesting a frequency of adverse effects similar to placebo. Aripiprazole seems not to cause significant EPSE, hyperprolactinaemia, excessive weight gain or cardiac rhythm disturbance.

In addition, the effectiveness even in acute and recent-onset psychosis could be shown in some studies. The effects of CBT and standard care in psychosis compared to standard care alone and to other psychosocial interventions plus standard care are reviewed. The results of several studies and one meta-analysis show that CBT in schizophrenia patients has a direct effect on psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations as well as on relapse prevention. In routine settings,however,CBT has until now only rarely been delivered to these patients. In so-called large pragmatic trials, which might be subsumed as phase IIIb studies, the effects are tested. The therapeutic approach with the components of CBT for psychosis are described: building a therapeutic relationship, cognitive-behavioural coping strategies, developing an understanding of the experience of psychosis,working on hallucinations and delusions, addressing negative self-evaluations, anxiety, and depression,managing risk of relapse and social disability. Further clinical implications are described (capability of learning the therapeutic strategies, deliverability in broader clinical settings, acceptability by patients, combination with atypical neuroleptic drugs,and treatment of choice in risk populations).",5,E

In the present study, we focused on the clinical efficacy and mechanisms of risperidone towards positive symptoms in the acute phase of schizophrenia. Thirty-four patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and treated with risperidone alone were evaluated regarding their clinical improvement using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) before and 2 weeks after risperidone administration, and blood samples were also drawn at the same times. Plasma concentrations of homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Plasma HVA levels in the responders to the risperidone treatment (more than 50% improvement in scores of positive symptoms in PANSS) were higher than those of non-responders before risperidone administration. Furthermore, there was a negative trend between changes in plasma HVA levels and improvement of total scores for positive symptoms in PANSS. These results suggest that higher levels of plasma HVA before risperidone administration might be a predictor of a good response to risperidone treatment, and the influence of risperidone on dopaminergic activity might be associated with its efficacy in treating symptoms of schizophrenia in the acute phase.",5,E

Short-acting intramuscular formulations are used to manage acute psychotic episodes. On the other hand, long-acting compounds, also called ""depot"", are administered as antipsychotic maintenance treatment to ensure compliance and to eliminate bioavailability problems related to absorption and first pass metabolism. Adverse effects of antipsychotics have been studied with particular respect to oral versus short- and long-acting intramuscular formulations of the different compounds. For short-term intramuscular preparations the main risk with classical compounds are hypotension and extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Data on the incidence of EPS with depot formulations are controversial: some studies point out that the incidence of EPS is significantly higher in patients receiving depot preparations, whereas others show no difference between oral and depot antipsychotics. Studies on the strategies for switching patients from oral to depot treatment suggest that this procedure is reasonably well tolerated, so that in clinical practice depot antipsychotic therapy is usually begun while the oral treatment is still being administered, with gradual tapering of the oral dose. Efficacy, pharmacodynamics and clinical pharmacokinetics of haloperidol decanoate, fluphenazine enanthate and decanoate, clopenthixol decanoate, zuclopenthixol decanoate and acutard, flupenthixol decanoate, perphenazine enanthate, pipothiazine palmitate and undecylenate, and fluspirilene are reviewed. In addition, the intramuscular preparations of atypical antipsychotics and clinical uses are reviewed. Olanzapine and ziprasidone are available only as short-acting preparations, while risperidone is to date the only novel antipsychotic available as depot formulation. To date, acutely ill, agitated psychotic patients have been treated with high parenteral doses of typical antipsychotics, which often cause serious EPS, especially dystonic reactions. Intramuscular formulations of novel antipsychotics (olanzapine and ziprasidone), which appear to have a better tolerability profile than typical compounds, showed an equivalent efficacy to parenteral typical agents in the acute treatment of psychoses.

All uncontrolled and controlled reports were identified through a comprehensive Medline search. Based on the available evidence, olanzapine was found to be the most appropriate atypical antipsychotic agent utilized for the treatment of manic bipolar patients, although there is also preliminary data suggesting the efficacy of risperidone and clozapine. The preliminary data evaluating the efficacy of quetiapine and ziprasidone in bipolar disorder are still very limited. Double-blind controlled studies with atypical antipsychotics in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder are still largely not available, but will be critical to determine the effectiveness of these agents in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. There are recent uncontrolled suggestions that olanzapine may have beneficial effects in depressed bipolar patients, which deserve further investigation in controlled studies. In conclusion, atypical antipsychotics, due to lower potential for neurotoxicity and preliminary evidence suggesting better efficacy than typical antipsychotics, are increasingly having a more prominent role in the pharmacological management of bipolar patients. Nonetheless, until there is systematic data from long-term controlled follow-up studies on the comparative efficacy of these agents with mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics should be cautiously utilized, and preferably in combination with a mood stabilizer for the maintenance phase of treatment.",I,5

It is important to compare switching strategies to determine which methods produce the best possible patient outcomes.; To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of three dosing strategies for switching chronic, stable patients with schizophrenia from current oral antipsychotic monotherapy to once-daily oral aripiprazole monotherapy.; Patients in this 8-week, open-label, outpatient study were randomized to: 1). immediate initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole with simultaneous immediate discontinuation of current antipsychotic; 2). immediate initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole while tapering off current antipsychotic over 2 weeks; or 3). up-titrating aripiprazole to 30 mg/day over 2 weeks, while simultaneously tapering off current antipsychotic. Efficacy assessments included PANSS, CGI-S, and CGI-I scores. Safety assessments included: adverse events (AEs) recording, evaluation of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests.; Efficacy with aripiprazole was maintained during the study with numerical improvements compared with baseline in all three groups. The overall incidence of AEs was broadly comparable across all groups, and AEs were generally mild to moderate in severity and time-limited. Discontinuations due to AEs were comparable across the groups. No deterioration in EPS occurred in any group. The reduction in body weight and plasma prolactin levels following switch to aripiprazole were comparable across the three groups.; Any of the three strategies evaluated can be used safely for switching patients to aripiprazole from antipsychotic monotherapy. Furthermore, patients' symptoms may continue to improve after switching to aripiprazole.",3,E

Risperidone and donepezil are both metabolized through cytochrome P450 2D6 and 3A4, raising the possibility of drug interactions with combination therapy. The objective of this study was to determine whether significant drug interactions occur with concomitant administration of donepezil and risperidone. In an open-label, three-way crossover study, 24 healthy men were randomly assigned to receive 0.5 mg of risperidone twice daily, 5 mg of donepezil once daily, or both drugs for 14 consecutive days, followed by a 21-day washout period. The treatment ratios of AUC and associated 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for risperidone active moiety, defined as risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone (ratio = 110.2%; 90% CI = 103.7-117.2), and for donepezil (ratio = 97.1%; 90% CI = 90.0-103.6) were within the 80% to 125% of bioequivalence range. The treatment ratios of Cmax and associated 90% CIs for risperidone active moiety (ratio = 114.6%; 90% CI = 107.0-122.8) and for donepezil (ratio = 96.1%; 90% CI = 90.0-102.6) were also within the bioequivalence range. Therefore, no significant pharmacokinetic differences occurred in either risperidone active moiety or donepezil when given alone or in combination. Adverse events (predominantly headache, nervousness, and somnolence) were minor and comparable for all treatment groups. The results indicate that no clinically meaningful drug interactions occurred between risperidone 1 mg daily and donepezil 5 mg daily at steady state, and therefore no dosage adjustment is required when both drugs are combined with the dosage regimen studied. Additional investigations are warranted to determine the potential for interactions in elderly patients with dementia who may eliminate risperidone and donepezil more slowly and thus be more vulnerable to clinical drug interactions than the young healthy subjects examined in this study.",6,E

This post-hoc analysis explored the response characteristics of olanzapine versus placebo in bipolar I manic patients with dysphoric and nondysphoric mania (differentiated by baseline Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAM-D] score of >20). Two similar, double-blind, randomized trials comparing olanzapine, 5-20 mg, to placebo were pooled for these analyses (N = 246). Mean changes in Young-Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) and HAM-D scores during 3 weeks of treatment were examined. Twenty-eight percent of patients had dysphoric mania (olanzapine, n = 33; placebo, n = 35). Among these patients, olanzapine-treated patients had greater improvement within 1 week than did placebo-treated patients on both mania ratings (Y-MRS: -9.7 vs. -3.0 points; = 0.011) and depressive symptom ratings (HAM-D: -9.9 vs. -5.4 points; = 0.025). Among those manic subjects without prominent depressive symptoms (olanzapine, n = 91; placebo, n = 87), mean Y-MRS improvement from baseline to endpoint with olanzapine (-11.5 points) versus placebo (-6.13 points) was comparable to the improvement seen with olanzapine versus placebo in the dysphoric mania subgroup ( = 0.476, test of interaction). In acutely ill manic patients with significant depressive symptoms, olanzapine demonstrated a broad spectrum of efficacy, effectively treating both manic and depressive symptoms. The magnitude of the antimanic response appears similar, regardless of baseline depressive features. Additional experience with putative mood stabilizers and atypical agents in mixed mania should include an exploration of their efficacy in treating both manic and depressive mood symptoms.",I,I

12640328,[Criteria defining antimanic drugs (psychopharmacological specificity and/or nonspecificity?)].,Antimanic Agents; Bipolar Disorder; Humans,"Azorin, J-M","The question as to whether specific antimanic drugs differ in their action profile from nonspecific drugs is addressed in regard to symptomatic, nosographic, regulatory and physiopathological issues. Results from clinical studies have shown that mood stabilizers and typical neuroleptics differ as regards improvement of manic symptoms: the former appear to act more evenly on all symptoms of mania, showing a more total normalization of affect, ideation and behaviour whereas the latter tend to sedate patients or to cause a psychomotor retardation, leaving the core manic symptoms unaffected. This has been many times underlined, in particular for lithium, notwithstanding the fact that rating scales employed in clinical trials have often been charged to fall far short of being sensitive enough to pick up the qualitative changes in manic psychopathology. Antimanic drugs may also be more or less specific in their capacities to treat all facets of the manic episode (psychotic, depressive, irritable) whatever the bipolar subtype (bipolar I, II, rapid and non-rapid cycling, secondary bipolar disorder) or the disease stage (early and late episodes). In this respect divalproate seems to have a broader spectrum of efficacy than other available agents. Newer antipsychotics such as olanzapine are promising too. From a regulatory point of view, the current European requirements for a specific antimanic drug are more stringent than the US requirements of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Efficacy must be demonstrated in short-term studies showing an effect in acute mania; moreover it has to be shown that efficacy is to be maintained during the episode. So far, three armed randomized controlled trials are required, in which the test product is compared both with placebo and with a standard treatment. A possible design is a comparison of test product, placebo and active control for 3 weeks followed by a two-arm phase for the remaining 9 weeks, comparing only test product and active control. In addition, a specific antimanic has to demonstrate that it does not cause switching to depression. As regards physiopathology, integrative models of bipolar disorder, ie kindling and behavioural sensitization, offer an exciting perspective on the specificity issue; agents active in these models initialize a cascade of intracellular signaling that leads to changes in the expression of immediate early genes as well as late effector genes in corticolimbic structures: the former may contribute to acute symptomatology whereas the latter give rise to neuroanatomical reorganization which could underlie more stable changes in mood and cognition. Due to their action on intracellular messaging systems, dopamine D(1) receptors, serotonin 5HT(1a) or 5HT(2a) receptors, especially in orbitofrontal circuit, antimanic agents may exhibit a more specific activity than other drugs. This specificity could concern a whole spectrum of bipolarity which might be characterized by impulsivity.",1,E

Sixty treatment-seeking patients meeting prodromal inclusion criteria were recruited across four sites: New Haven, CT (n=39), Toronto, Ontario (n=9), Calgary, Alberta (n=6), and Chapel Hill, NC (n=6). The sample was young (median age 16), largely male (65%), and came from families with high titers of serious mental illness (44%). Most patients (93%) met criteria for the Attenuated Positive Symptom (APS) prodromal syndrome and presented with significant but nonpsychotic suspiciousness, perceptual aberrations, unusual thought content, and conceptual disorganization. They presented with minimal to mild affective symptoms and substance use/abuse, but they were quite functionally compromised (mean Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score=42). The prodromal sample was compared with other clinical-trial samples of adolescent depression, adolescent mania, and first episode schizophrenia. Prodromal patients proved not to be depressed or manic. They were less severely ill than untreated first episode schizophrenia but more severely ill than treated first episode schizophrenia.

The forced five-factor solution essentially corresponds to the factors most frequently described previously, namely negative, positive, disorganized (or cognitive), excited and anxiety/depression. In the exploratory analysis, a seven-factor solution was obtained, with depression and anxiety symptoms separating and a motor component emerging. The results of this study partially support the use of a five-factor model for the PANSS, but suggest that scales for catatonia, depressive and anxiety syndromes should be included in future studies.",6,E

These antipsychotics also frequently induce amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea. Although comparative studies are rare, it is likely that prolactin-sparing antipsychotics, as recently shown in a randomized trial of olanzapine versus risperidone, induce less sexual side effects.From these studies, it becomes apparent that prolactin elevation induced by classical antipsychotics and risperidone is probably a factor in inducing sexual dysfunctions, amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea. The role of other factors inducing sexual dysfunctions like sedation, proportional, variant -blockade, testosterone, dopamine, and serotonin is discussed. Finally, it is concluded that sexual and hormonal effects of antipsychotics, although clearly important, are often neglected in research as in clinical practice. Lowering the dosage or switching to a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic often reduces sexual side effects, amenorrhoea, and galactorrhoea.",5,E

Nizatidine, a histamine H-2 receptor antagonist, has been proposed to have weight-reducing effects. This double-blind trial evaluated the efficacy of nizatidine in limiting weight gain in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders who were treated with olanzapine for up to 16 weeks. After an initial screening period, 175 patients were randomized to receive olanzapine (5-20 mg) with either placebo or nizatidine (150 mg b.i.d. or 300 mg b.i.d.). Significantly less weight gain was observed on average at weeks 3 and 4 with olanzapine+nizatidine 300 mg b.i.d. (P<0.05) compared to olanzapine+placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant at 16 weeks. Nizatidine was well-tolerated and did not adversely affect clinical outcomes.

However, most studies have examined basic reaction time under static conditions using a single measurement. The aim of the present study was to establish whether any changes occur in simple reaction time during treatment with risperidone or olanzapine in in-patients suffering a relapse of schizophrenia.; Seventeen in-patients suffering acute relapse of schizophrenia (DSM IV criteria) and twenty matched, healthy controls participated in an eight-week, double-blind pilot study. The patients were treated with conventional antipsychotics for seven days after admission and were then randomised to the treatment arms with risperidone (4 mg/day) or with olanzapine (10 mg/day) at a fixed dosage in the first week and thereafter in flexible dosages for the remaining seven weeks. Since no differences were found between reaction times of patients treated with risperidone or olanzapine, the two treatment groups were merged in the statistical analysis before being compared with the normal controls. Psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and extrapyramidal symptoms with the Simpson Angus Scale and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Reaction time was measured with the Alpha apparatus, connected to a personal computer. All assessments and measurements were conducted four times during the treatment phase of the study.; The reaction time of patients was significantly longer than that of the healthy controls (t1 = 17.11; p1 < 0.05). After eight weeks of treatment the reaction time of patients significantly improved but did not reach that of the healthy controls (t4 = 28.18, p4 < 0.05). Furthermore, the improved reaction time in the patients did not correlate with improvement of psychopathological symptoms or with improved extrapyramidal symptoms.; The results of the study suggest that simple reaction time can improve during treatment with atypical antipsychotics.",4,E

Increasing antipsychotics' doses in treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients is the most common intervention used by clinicians. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic, which in a number of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies has been found to be more effective than haloperidol for the treatment of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. During the last few years there have been several reports of successful results in prescribing olanzapine at dosages of more than 25 mg/day for treatment-resistant schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients. This report presents the results from the treatment of three resistant schizophrenic patients treated successfully with high dosages of olanzapine (35, 40, and 60 mg/day). None of the patients had any side effects, including abnormal laboratory levels and weight gain. The results and literature data suggest that in clinical practice some schizophrenic patients resistant to conventional neuroleptic treatment and not responding to olanzapine at recommended dosages as high as 20 mg/day may respond to higher dosages such as 40 or 60 mg/day, and these dosages are well tolerated.

Consistent with theories of deficiencies in early stages of information processing, PPI is found to be reduced in patients with schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotics are found to be more effective than typical antipsychotics in improving PPI in this population. Anticholinergic drugs are often used to control extrapyramidal symptoms induced by antipsychotic medication, especially by typical antipsychotics, in schizophrenic patients and are known to disrupt cognitive functions in both normal and schizophrenic populations. The effect of anticholinergics on PPI in schizophrenia has not yet been examined. This study determined the effects of procyclidine, an anticholinergic drug, on PPI in patients with schizophrenia given risperidone or quetiapine and not on any anticholinergic drugs, employing a placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Under double-blind conditions, subjects were administered oral 15 mg procyclidine and placebo on separate occasions, 2 weeks apart, and tested for acoustic PPI (prepulse 8 dB and 15 dB above the background and delivered with 30-ms, 60-ms and 120-ms prepulse-to-pulse intervals). Procyclidine significantly impaired PPI compared to placebo (assessed as percentage reduction) with 60-ms prepulse-to-pulse trials and increased the latencies to response peak across all trials.

National prescription data for the same period were obtained.; There were 79 patients with valproate poisoning from January 1991 to November 2001, 15 cases with valproate alone. Of the 15 cases, drowsiness occurred in two patients (both taking> 200 mg kg-1), vomiting occurred in four and tachycardia in five.

One patient had metabolic acidosis and thrombocytopaenia consistent with severe valproate toxicity. Comparison of valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin and control groups showed that length of stay for both phenytoin and carbamazepine was significantly longer than for valproate (P < 0.0001), and there was a significantly increased risk of intensive care unit admission for carbamazepine vs valproate (OR 2.73; 95% CI 1.22, 6.28; P = 0.015).

Deficits, functional consequences, and future treatment.",Antipsychotic Agents; Cognition Disorders; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests; Schizophrenia; Severity of Illness Index,"Sharma, Tonmoy; Antonova, Lena","This article has discussed the relationship between cognitive deficits and functional outcome in schizophrenia. This relationship was noted first by Kraepelin and Bleuler at the beginning of the twentieth century. With the introduction of conventional neuroleptics, the focus shifted toward the treatment of positive symptoms. In the past few decades, cognitive dysfunction has been recognized as a fundamental feature of schizophrenia and has been shown repeatedly to have a negative association with functional outcome [6]. Improvement in cognitive functioning became one of the most important clinical targets in the treatment of schizophrenia in the 1990s [82]. Main domains of cognition that are disrupted significantly in schizophrenia include attention, executive function, verbal and visuospatial working memory, and learning and memory. Although conventional antipsychotics are effective in treating positive symptoms, they lack the ability to improve cognitive impairment and produce poor functional outcome. Previous research has shown superior efficacy of atypical antipsychotics on cognitive impairments in schizophrenia compared with conventional antipsychotics. Because the heterogeneity of atypical antipsychotics in their pharmacologic properties, they have differential profiles of cognitive efficacy in patients with schizophrenia. Establishing the cognitive profile of each atypical antipsychotic is an important task. This knowledge can be used to address individual cognitive problems and needs. Because cognitive deficits have been shown to have associations with different aspects of clinical symptoms, limited learning in rehabilitation programs, and functional outcome in schizophrenia, targeting individual cognitive deficits would lead to greater treatment success in terms of clinical and functional outcome. Although atypical antipsychotics have some benefit on cognitive function, further efforts to improve cognitive function are required. Attempts at improving cognition in schizophrenia with specific cognitive enhancers pharmacologically and psychological therapies such as cognitive remediation might lead to better functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia.",5,E

Membrane phospholipid dysregulation and its therapeutic implications.,"Antipsychotic Agents; Brain; Brain Diseases, Metabolic; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Membrane Lipids; Neurons; Phospholipids; Schizophrenia; Signal Transduction; Time Factors","Mahadik, Sahebarao P; Evans, Denise R","The dysregulation of membrane phospholipid metabolism exists throughout the body from the onset of psychosis in schizophrenic patients. This dysregulation is primarily due to altered contents of phospholipid bound EPUFAs, AA and DHA. These EPUFAs are highly enriched in the brain and are crucial for brain and behavioral development. A phospholipid metabolic defect may preexist the onset of psychosis, even through early embryonic stages. Because these membrane phospholipids play a crucial role in the membrane receptor-mediated signal transduction of several neuro-transmitters and growth factors, their altered metabolism may contribute to the reported abnormal information processing in schizophrenia. Severity of symptoms seems to correlate with the membrane AA and DHA status, which is influenced by patients' dietary intake and lifestyle. Such a metabolic defect can be prevented, however, and some membrane pathology can be corrected by dietary supplementation with a combination of AA and DHA and antioxidants such as vitamins E and C. In schizophrenia, it may be advisable to provide supplementation at the early stages of illness, when brain has a high degree of plasticity. Finally, at this time, supplementation has to be considered as an augmentation of conventional antipsychotic treatment.",5,E

Although the efficacy of neuroleptics in controlling agitation and psychosis associated with late-life dementia has been established, evidence for their efficacy in treating core symptoms of late-life schizophrenia other than behavioral dyscontrol is just emerging. More controlled clinical trials are needed. The available data suggest that atypical neuroleptics are therapeutically efficacious, with a more favorable side-effect profile than conventional neuroleptics. This literature further suggests the importance of low therapeutic doses and careful attention to the emergence of side effects. Future studies must distinguish between patients with true schizophrenic disorder and patients with psychosis secondary to dementia, affective illness, or organic impairment. Patients must be characterized further as having EOS versus LOS because these disorders may differ in symptom profile, course, and response to treatment. There is also a need in future studies to separate out the results of treatment of patients with EOS who have been severely ill for most of their lives from those whose course has been less devastating. Within these two groups, treatment response, effective dose ranges, and sensitivity to side effects can be scrutinized more carefully.",5,E
12683264,The new and evolving pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia.,Antipsychotic Agents; Humans; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Schizophrenia,"Emsley, Robin; Oosthuizen, Piet","Based on the evidence presented here, the following tentative conclusions can be drawn. Atypical antipsychotics (except amisulpride) have shown superiority over placebo in acute schizophrenia. Compared with conventional antipsychotics, they are at least as effective. Generally, analyses employing conservative criteria (e.g., Cochrane reviews) report few efficacy differences between atypical and conventional agents. There are now many well-controlled studies indicating modest advantages for the atypical antipsychotics, however, particularly in specific symptom domains. For the treatment of negative symptoms, olanzapine and to a lesser extent amisulpride seem most promising. Risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine display advantages in improving cognitive and depressive symptoms. There are indications that the atypical antipsychotics are associated with decreased likelihood of rehospitalization and improved quality of life. In head-to-head comparisons of atypical antipsychotics, none have shown consistent efficacy advantages. In severely refractory samples, no atypical antipsychotics have consistently been shown to be as effective as clozapine or superior to conventional agents. There are indications, however, that risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine have advantages over conventional agents in less severely refractory patients. Few maintenance RCTs have been published, and efficacy advantages for atypical antipsychotics in prospective RCTs in first-episode schizophrenia have not been reported.",5,E

Although these medications have favorable extrapyramidal side-effect profiles, clinicians must be aware of their propensity to cause weight gain, glucose and lipid abnormalities, and cardiac and sexual side effects. If clinicians are proactive about warning patients about these side effects and appropriately monitoring them, further morbidity and mortality may be prevented in this patient population. Initial choices of medication should be made based on the relative side-effect profiles in light of a particular patient's medical status. In the future, new treatments may be developed, with even fewer side effects.",I,5

Recognition of this risk and providing access and continuity of appropriate psychiatric care should be major clinical and administrative objectives in the management of violence in psychotic patients. To date, pharmacologic approaches have been unclear and inconsistent. At present, typical antipsychotics continue to have a primary role in acute management and in long-term management, in which noncompliance necessitates the use of long-acting depot neuroleptic preparations. Atypical antipsychotics in acute and long-acting intramuscular forms doubtless will influence and expand the choice for acute management of hostile psychotic patients and the long-term management of poorly compliant patients who are at risk to become violent on relapse. Persistent aggression should be managed by atypical antipsychotics with a preferential indication for clozapine, for which the most data on efficacy are available. The role of adjunctive medications is presently unclear. A major focus of care should be to refine legal processes and to conduct intervention studies aimed at enhancing treatment compliance. Violence risk reduction is not only crucial from a societal perspective, but also it is a humanitarian necessity to alleviate the burden and stigma for patients with serious mental illness.",5,E

Although the relative efficacy of both drugs compared to conventional antipsychotics is well established, it remains unclear how the efficacy of amisulpride compares with risperidone. There have been no controlled studies comparing amisulpride to risperidone in Asian patients. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of amisulpride with that of risperidone in Taiwanese schizophrenic patients.; Patients with productive positive symptoms (n = 48) were enrolled into this double-blind, randomized pilot study for 6 weeks. Patients received either amisulpride (400-800 mg/day) or risperidone (4-8 mg/day). Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), and patients' subjective responses to treatment were assessed during the trial period. Adverse events were recorded at each follow-up visit.; At the end of the trial, the mean dosage was 630 +/- 134 mg/day and 6.88 +/- 1.54 mg/day for amisulpride and risperidone, respectively. There was no significant difference in the reduction of the PANSS total score (amisulpride -24.1 versus risperidone -28.4, p = 0.999), the PANSS positive subscale score (amisulpride -6.8 versus risperidone -8.3, p = 0.467), the PANSS negative subscale score (amisulpride -5.6 versus risperidone -6.4, p = 0.999), or the CGI score between the two groups. The extrapyramidal symptom ratings, the improvement in the SOFAS (amisulpride 11.1 versus risperidone 10.0) and the subjective response (amisulpride 82% versus risperidone 83%) were comparable. No serious adverse events were recorded in either treatment group. There was a statistically significant body weight gain in the risperidone group. In contrast, there was a statistically, though not clinically, significant reduction of blood pressure and heart rate in the amisulpride group.; This study suggests that amisulpride is as effective as risperidone in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. Both drugs were well tolerated, but had different side effect profiles.",1,E

The authors conducted a prospective, open, controlled trial of ECT in TRS in a long-term psychiatric rehabilitation unit in Hong Kong. Thirty patients with TRS from an inpatient psychiatric rehabilitation unit participated in this study. All subjects were resistant to a host of antipsychotic medications given singly or in different combinations. In addition, they were also resistant to or they refused clozapine treatment. Fifteen patients completed a course of ECT consisting of 8-20 sessions. Fifteen patients who refused ECT formed the control Subjects were assessed at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 2 months after their last ECT. Assessment instruments included the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Global Assessment Scale (GAS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), CGI Severity of Illness [CGI(SOI)], CGI Global Improvement [CGI(GI)], Nurses' Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE-30), and occupational therapists' rating of the subjects' functioning with respect to work (OT-W), social (OT-S), and leisure (OT-L) activities. In comparison with the control group, the ECT group showed statistically significant improvement only in the GAS and CGI at each posttreatment evaluation. There was a trend for ECT to reduce positive and negative symptoms, although the rate of improvement did not reach statistically significant levels. ECT augmentation of risperidone and olanzapine is of marginal efficacy compared to reports of the greater augmentation of these antipsychotics with other agents.",5,E

One hundred and fifty-eight patients fulfilled the criteria for first-episode schizophrenia, defined as (1) the International Classification of Diseases: Mental and Behavioral Disorders, 10th ed. (ICD-10) diagnosis of schizophrenia, (2) antipsychotic nai;ve, and (3) a course of illness of less than 5 years. Eighty-nine (56.3%) of these patients were assigned to the olanzapine treatment group (OLZ) and 69 (43.7%) to the control group that received treatment with conventional antipsychotics (CON). Safety was evaluated in terms of the spontaneous adverse events reported and a specific questionnaire for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Clinical status was measured by means of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S). Clinical response was defined as the baseline-endpoint decrease in BPRS>40% plus an endpoint BPRS<18 or an endpoint CGI</=3.; The rate of clinical response to treatment in the OLZ was 76.7%, compared to 54.4% in the CON (chi(2)=8.48; P=.003). Olanzapine was significantly more effective than conventional antipsychotics in lowering the total BPRS score (P=.0003), as well as each of the following BPRS subscales: positive symptoms (P=.0019), negative symptoms (P<.0001), depression (P=.018), and agitation (P=.007), even after mean scores were adjusted for their baseline value and disease duration. Olanzapine also proved to be significantly superior to conventional antipsychotics in lowering mean CGI scores (P=.013). The frequency with which new EPS appeared, or previously existing ones worsened, was significantly greater in the CON than in the OLZ (55.1% vs. 13.5%; P<.001). Anticholinergics were needed more frequently in the CON than in the OLZ (58.0% vs. 6.7%; P<.0001).; The results of this observational, naturalistic study show that olanzapine is safe and effective in a nonselected sample of acute, first-episode schizophrenic inpatients.",I,4

However, none of these studies compared the hematological and immune parameters before and after treatment. The present study is aimed at investigating the influence of olanzapine on the immune cell parameters by comparing these before and in the third month of olanzapine treatment in patients of schizophrenia. Twenty patients who were diagnosed as schizophrenic depending on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were included in the study. The immune parameters of patients were compared by measuring them before the treatment and 3 months after treatment. Immune parameters were analyzed by using flow-cytometry equipment labeled Coulter Epics Elite ESP. The positivity of cell-surface antibody was evaluated as percentage. The rates of CD8 in the third month of the treatment were considerably increased relative to pretreatment. Furthermore, rates of CD4/CD8 were significantly decreased in the third month of the treatment relative to before treatment. These findings suggest that immune impairment may occur during olanzapine treatment in patients with schizophrenia.",5,E

This flexible-dose study examined efficacy and safety in a randomized, double-blind, 52-week trial, comparing chlorpromazine (CPZ) and clozapine (CLZ) in treatment naive patients experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia. In all, 160 inpatients with first-episode schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder were randomized to CPZ or CLZ and followed them for 52 weeks or until dropout. The primary efficacy measure was time to first remission and proportion of time remaining in remission. The analysis was supplemented by comparisons on a profile of clinical symptoms and side effects. Of these first-episode patients, 80% achieved remission within 1 year (79% CPZ, 81% CLZ). The Kaplan-Meier estimated median time to first remission was 8 weeks for CLZ vs 12 weeks for CPZ (chi(2)(1)=5.56, p=0.02). Both the rate of first achieving remission and the odds for being in remission during the trial were almost doubled for the CLZ group in comparison with the CPZ group. At 12 weeks, CLZ was superior on many rating scale measures of symptom severity while CPZ was not superior on any. These symptom differences remained significant when controlling for EPS differences. By 52 weeks many of the symptom differences between groups were no longer significantly different. Generally, CLZ produced fewer side effects than CPZ, particularly extrapyramidal side effects. There was no significant difference between treatments in weight change or glucose metabolism. For each prior year of untreated psychosis, there was a 15% decrease in the odds of achieving remission (OR=0.85; CI 0.75-0.95). A high proportion of first-episode patients remitted within 1 year. We detected no difference in the proportion of first-episode patients receiving CLZ or CPZ that achieved remission. However, first-episode patients receiving CLZ remitted significantly faster and remained in remission longer than subjects receiving CPZ. While the CLZ group showed significantly less symptomatology on some measures and fewer side effects at 12 weeks, the two treatment groups seemed to converge by 1 year. Longer duration of untreated psychosis was associated with lower odds of achieving remission.",4,E

The risk of diabetes, and hence cardiovascular disease, is particularly increased by some of the new atypical antipsychotic drugs. Individuals taking an atypical antipsychotic drug, particularly younger patients under 40 years of age (odds ratio 1.63, 95% CI 1.23-2.16), represent an underrecognized group at high risk of type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms responsible for antipsychotic-induced diabetes remain unclear. Hypotheses include these drugs' potential to cause weight gain, possibly through antagonism at the H(1), 5-HT(2A), or 5-HT(2C) receptors. Other mechanisms independent of weight gain lead to elevation of serum leptin and insulin resistance. Patients with psychoses have difficulties with diet and lifestyle interventions for diabetes and weight management. If hyperglycemia develops, withdrawal from antipsychotic medication will often be inappropriate, and a change to an atypical antipsychotic drug with lower diabetogenic potential should be considered, especially in younger patients. Management of psychoses should routinely include body weight and blood glucose monitoring and steps to promote exercise and minimize weight gain. Careful collaboration between the psychiatric and diabetology teams is essential to minimize the risk of diabetes in patients taking atypical antipsychotic medication and for effective management when it develops. This collaboration will also help minimize the already high risk of cardiovascular disease in individuals with schizophrenia.",I,6

The subjective assessment of memory functioning improved during the treatment with olanzapine. Before the hospitalisation and after 6 weeks of treatment patients' memory complaints were associated with the visuospatial memory. After 12 month of the olanzapine therapy the memory complaints were associated with audioverbal memory.

Statistical analyses confirmed that most subjects maintained efficacy during the switch to once- or twice-daily administration with quetiapine. A minority (15%) did experience worsening of symptoms or orthostatic hypotension during the crossover. Quetiapine was generally well tolerated at either twice- or once-daily administration.; These pilot data suggest that it is clinically feasible to switch most quetiapine-treated subjects receiving a therapeutic twice-daily dosing schedule to a once-daily regimen.

Presented here is a pooled analysis of safety and tolerability data from all completed short-term, placebo-controlled trials in schizophrenia from the aripiprazole clinical development program. Data were analyzed from five 4- to 6-week double-blind multicenter studies of patients hospitalized with acute relapse of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder randomized to aripiprazole (n=932), placebo (n=416), or haloperidol (n=201). Daily aripiprazole doses ranged from 2 to 30 mg. Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) reports, EPS scales, ECGs, weight, and prolactin, glucose and cholesterol levels. Aripiprazole was well tolerated, with similar AE incidence rates to placebo, and lower rates than haloperidol for akathisia, extrapyramidal syndrome and somnolence. Objective EPS assessments demonstrated no significant differences between aripiprazole and placebo on Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) scores, no dose-dependent effects on Barnes Akathisia scores, and significant reductions in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores from baseline vs. placebo (p</=0.01). Haloperidol showed increased SAS and Barnes Akathisia scores over placebo (p</=0.01). There was minimal mean weight change with aripiprazole (+0.71 kg) and haloperidol (+0.56 kg), and a lack of QT(c) prolongation. Serum prolactin increased with haloperidol, but not aripiprazole. In conclusion, aripiprazole shows a favorable safety and tolerability profile with low potential for EPS, weight gain, prolactin elevation, QT(c) prolongation, and sedation. Aripiprazole's safety profile may offer benefits in schizophrenia treatment.",I,4

The aim of the study was to investigate the antipsychotic potential of trimipramine in a controlled clinical trial comparing its antipsychotic efficacy with that of a neuroleptic.; In a German multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial, the antipsychotic efficacy of trimipramine was compared with that of the phenothiazine neuroleptic perazine, using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). Antidepressant efficacy of both agents was measured by use of the Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale (BRMES). Ninety-five patients with acute schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) and a BPRS total score > 40 at baseline were treated with either 300-400 mg trimipramine or 450-600 mg perazine for 5 weeks.; Therapeutic equivalence of both treatments (in the dosages used) could not be demonstrated (change in BPRS total score, per-protocol [PP] analysis, one-sided equivalence testing). However, intention-to-treat (ITT) as well as PP analysis showed a statistically significant decrease in the BPRS total scores in both treatment groups (PP: trimipramine, 56.5 +/- 9.8 to 44.1 +/- 17.9; perazine, 56.4 +/- 10.8 to 37.9 +/- 12.9). Significant decreases in all BPRS and PANSS subscores as well as CGI results and response rate support the antipsychotic efficacy of trimipramine. The BRMES total scores significantly decreased in both treatment groups without showing a significant difference between the two agents. Trimipramine was better tolerated than perazine and did not elicit extrapyramidal symptoms.; Trimipramine failed to exhibit therapeutic equivalence to perazine in the dosages used.

We studied the effect of this transition on the continuity of antipsychotic therapy among patients with severe mental illness who had previously adhered to treatment.; Study patients were 21 to 64 years of age, were enrolled throughout the study period, and had adhered to antipsychotic therapy during a 6-month base-line period that preceded the 12 months of study follow-up. The study population included 4507 patients whose follow-up began on the day the change was implemented (the post-transition cohort) and 3644 patients whose follow-up began one year earlier (the pretransition cohort). We compared the two cohorts in terms of the loss of continuity of antipsychotic therapy (missed treatment for more than 60 days during follow-up) and the mean number of days of antipsychotic therapy during follow-up.; As compared with the pretransition cohort, the post-transition cohort had increased odds of loss of continuity (a multivariate odds ratio of 1.18 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.30], P=0.001) and a shorter mean duration of antipsychotic therapy (a mean reduction of 4.2 days [95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 6.7], P=0.001) during follow-up. This difference was most pronounced among high-risk patients (those requiring the administration of extended-release [depot] injections of antipsychotic medications or who had been hospitalized for psychosis) at base line, for whom continuity was most important (odds ratio for loss of continuity, 1.79 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.45 to 2.22]; P<0.001; mean reduction in the number of days of antipsychotic therapy, 14.4 days [95 percent confidence interval, 9.4 to 19.4]; P<0.001).

We reviewed the scientific and ethical advantages and disadvantages of the placebo-controlled trial and an alternative method, the active-control trial, focusing more specifically on the active-control noninferiority trial. Recent meta-analyses indicate that a therapeutic dose of second-generation antipsychotic will very likely be statistically superior to placebo in an adequate trial, and that the average improvement of schizophrenia symptoms in a placebo arm will be small. These findings strengthen the scientific and ethical justification for the active-control noninferiority trial. New drugs in the pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia are often claimed to differ from their marketed competitors in their safety profile rather than in antipsychotic efficacy. Thus, in many cases, it appears sufficient to demonstrate mere noninferiority (rather than superiority) of antipsychotic efficacy in comparison with a standard antipsychotic. The active-control noninferiority trial is suitable for such demonstration. Sample size requirements for various equivalence margins in noninferiority trials are provided.

These findings might have been biased by the use of the high-potency antipsychotic haloperidol as a comparator in most of the trials. We aimed to establish whether the new drugs induce fewer EPS than low-potency conventional antipsychotics.; We did a meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials in which new generation antipsychotics had been compared with low-potency (equivalent or less potent than chlorpromazine) conventional drugs. We included studies that met quality criteria A or B in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook, and assessed quality with the Jadad scale. The primary outcome of interest was the number of patients who had at least one EPS. We used risk differences and 95% CIs as measures of effect size.; We identified 31 studies with a total of 2320 participants. Of the new generation drugs, only clozapine was associated with significantly fewer EPS (RD=-0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.4, p=0.008) and higher efficacy than low-potency conventional drugs. Reduced frequency of EPS seen with olanzapine was of borderline significance (-0.15, -0.31 to -0.01, p=0.07). Only one inconclusive trial of amisulpride, quetiapine, and risperidone and no investigations of ziprasidone and sertindole were identified, but some evidence indicates that zotepine and remoxipride do not lead to fewer EPS than low-potency antipsychotics. Mean doses less than 600 mg/day of chlorpromazine or its equivalent had no higher risk of EPS than new generation drugs. As a group, new generation drugs were moderately more efficacious than low-potency antipsychotics, largely irrespective of the comparator doses used.; Optimum doses of low-potency conventional antipsychotics might not induce more EPS than new generation drugs. Potential advantages in efficacy of the new generation drugs should be a factor in clinical treatment decisions to use these rather than conventional drugs.",I,I

Also, quetiapine may be superior to placebo and either equal or superior to haloperidol in treating this symptom. Available data for other second-generation antipsychotic agents show that quetiapine may have better efficacy in improving agitation compared with haloperidol.; This reanalysis of a previously reported pivotal clinical trial assessed whether quetiapine or haloperidol has benefits for the treatment of hostility and agitation among patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.; Patients aged 18 to 65 years of either sex and any ethnicity who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition criteria and who were experiencing an acute exacerbation were recruited into the study. A priori, data from patients assigned to 4 therapeutically effective quetiapine treatment groups (150, 300, 600, and 750 mg) in a previously reported 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial were combined and compared with data from patients given haloperidol 12 mg or placebo on an agitation measure derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Patients who received at least 2 weeks of treatment who had a baseline assessment and at least 1 postbaseline assessment after the 2 weeks of treatment were included. An analysis of variance with the baseline hostility score and center as covariates was used to assess treatment effects of quetiapine or haloperidol versus placebo for changes in agitation scores. A path analysis was used to separate the direct from the indirect effects (via improvements in psychoses and/or overall psychopathology) on agitation scores of quetiapine relative to haloperidol.; A total of 257 patients (193 men, 64 women) were studied. The combined quetiapine groups comprised 175 patients; the haloperidol group, 42 patients; and the placebo group, 40 patients. Quetiapine treatment reduced agitation scores significantly among patients with acute psychoses compared with placebo. A slight reduction in agitation scores was found when haloperidol treatment was compared with placebo, but this difference was not statistically significant. Compared with haloperidol, quetiapine treatment had a direct and significant effect on agitation that was independent of the improvement in psychotic symptoms.; The data in this study suggest that quetiapine treatment has benefits for hostility and agitation among patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Furthermore, the path analysis indicated that, relative to haloperidol, quetiapine appeared to have direct effects on agitation that were independent of improvements in psychoses or overall psychopathology, as assessed by the BPRS.",I,4

The main outcome measure was cost of inpatient drug treatment. Clinical outcomes (clinician-assessed and -documented effectiveness, time to discharge) were also evaluated. Data were collected and verified between June and September 2000.; Clinical outcomes were similar for risperidone and olanzapine. Clinician-assessed effectiveness was similar for both treatments (78% risperidone, 74% olanzapine; p =.39), but mean time to documented onset of effectiveness was significantly shorter for those treated with risperidone versus olanzapine (17.6 vs. 22.4 days; p =.01). Risperidone-treated patients stayed a mean of 9 fewer days in the hospital compared with olanzapine-treated patients (49 vs. 58 days; p =.007). The possibility that these observed differences were a result of different baseline characteristics could not be entirely discounted. Mean +/- SD doses of risperidone and olanzapine were 5.5 +/- 2.4 mg/day and 14.1 +/- 4.7 mg/day, respectively. The mean daily cost of all inpatient drugs was significantly higher for olanzapine than for risperidone (pound 5.63 vs. pound 3.92; p <.0001). Mean total costs of all inpatient drugs were significantly higher for olanzapine than for risperidone (pound 164 vs. pound 96; p <.0001), which partly reflected the longer mean treatment duration for olanzapine compared with risperidone (44 vs. 37 days). Concomitant antipsychotic use was similar for both groups (66% risperidone, 67% olanzapine). The number of patients documented as experiencing adverse events was not different between groups (22% risperidone, 19% olanzapine; p =.32).; Risperidone and olanzapine produced broadly comparable clinical outcome in this cohort of hospitalized patients, but the use of risperidone was associated with significantly lower drug treatment costs.",2,E

Leptin has been reported to be associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Previous studies have demonstrated a relationship between the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine and serum leptin levels. We planned to comparatively investigate the effects of the atypical antipsychotics quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and clozapine on leptin and triglyceride levels and weight gain.; The study population comprised 56 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia, who were divided into 4 treatment groups: quetiapine (N = 14), olanzapine (N = 14), risperidone (N = 14), or clozapine (N = 14) monotherapy, and a control group of 11 patients receiving no psychopharmacologic treatment. The patients were evaluated at baseline and at the sixth week according to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), body mass index (BMI), weight, and fasting serum leptin and triglyceride levels. Data were gathered in 2001 and 2002.; Olanzapine and clozapine caused a marked increase in weight and serum triglyceride and leptin levels, though increases in these variables were modest in the patients receiving quetiapine and minimal in those receiving risperidone. There were positive correlations between serum leptin levels and BMI and triglyceride levels. Clinical efficacy, as indicated by decrease in total PANSS scores, was associated with leptin levels in all atypical antipsychotic groups.; Our results suggest that leptin may be associated with olanzapine- and clozapine-induced weight gain and that quetiapine appears to have modest influence and risperidone appears to have minimal influence on leptin and triglyceride levels and weight gain compared with olanzapine and clozapine.",I,4

This study was designed to investigate the proportion of undiagnosed impaired fasting glucose and diabetes mellitus in patients prescribed clozapine at 8 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers.; All patients diagnosed by the VA in New England with ICD-9 schizophrenia from Oct. 1, 1999, to Sept. 30, 2000, who received a prescription for clozapine were identified, and an attempt was made to obtain a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test. All patients were also characterized as to whether they were diagnosed as diabetic prior to the screening FPG. Patients not previously diagnosed as diabetic were divided into 2 groups: normal FPG (< 110 mg/dL) and elevated FPG (>or= 110 mg/dL). Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of the 2 groups were compared using chi-square and t tests.; Overall, 121 patients were not previously diagnosed as diabetic and received an FPG. Ninety-three (77%) had a normal FPG, and 28 (23%) had an elevated plasma glucose-including 17% with impaired fasting glucose and 6% with diabetes. Patients with hyperglycemia were significantly older (p =.007) and more commonly codiagnosed with bipolar disorder (p =.04).; Hyperglycemia was common in patients receiving clozapine who had not been previously diagnosed as diabetic. These patients should be considered a group at high risk to develop diabetes mellitus and deserve both close monitoring and early intervention at the first sign of the onset of either diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.",I,6

Drug therapy for this disorder is insufficiently effective at present, making it necessary to improve the treatment of such patients by means of an adequate psychotherapeutic and rehabilitation program.; To assess the role of psychotherapeutic and rehabilitation measures in improving outcome in the early stage of vascular dementia.; The test and control cohorts (each n = 95) were matched for characteristics found to be significant for outcome of treatment (the relevant predictors were found using Multiple Regression Analysis). The cohorts differed in the amount of the psychotherapy and rehabilitation received. To assess the effects of treatment the SCAG scale and a special scale for evaluating the level of activity in the household were used.; In the test cohort the patients' condition improved significantly compared with the controls. Even in case of only slight therapeutic reduction of psychopathologic symptoms the systematic use of psychotherapeutic and rehabilitation methods favoured preserving a certain level of activity in the household and for some patients even improving it.; The results of therapy at the early stage of vascular dementia to a great extent depend on carrying out a full-scale psychotherapeutic and rehabilitation program. The positive significance of the latter is connected not only with improvement of clinical indices but also with direct optimizing the every day life activity level.",5,E

Between and within group intention to treat analyses were conducted.; 66 patients were randomised (mean age 69.6 [SD +/- 6.2]). Four (11.8%) patients on olanzapine and 8 (26.7%) patients on risperidone failed to complete the crossover because of treatment failure [Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.73[0.73-10.2] p = 0.14]. The mean doses upon completion of switching in each arm were 9.9 mg (SD = 4.2) and 1.7 mg (SD = 1.2) for olanzapine and risperidone respectively. In both arms there was improvement in Parkinsonism, though only olanzapine was associated with a reduction in dyskinetic symptoms. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Scale for the assessment of Negative Symptoms and Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores all improved through the crossover period in both arms with no between group differences. Treatment with olanzapine was associated with a better response over risperidone on the psychological domain of the World Health Organisation-Quality Of Life [Brief] (WHO-QOL-BREF) scale ( p = 0.02). Patients in the olanzapine arm also demonstrated improvement from baseline in the WHO-QOL-BREF physical, psychological and health satisfaction domains, but risperidone had no effect on any Quality of Life (QOL) measure.; After switching from a conventional antipsychotic, olanzapine and risperidone were associated with improvement in core symptoms of schizophrenia and motor side effects.

Nefazodone blocks postsynaptic 5HT2A receptors and weakly inhibits serotonin reuptake. This study aimed to elucidate the role of nefazodone in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced EPS. The trial was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of patients requiring antipsychotic treatment with haloperidol 10mg daily; from which a subgroup of patients who developed EPS were selected for the study. Patients were randomised to add-on therapy with either placebo (n=24) or nefazodone (n=25) 100mg bd. EPS were measured on days 0, 3 and 7 using the Simpson Angus, Barnes akathisia, abnormal involuntary movement and Chouinard scales. Nefazodone significantly reduced EPS as measured by both the Simpson Angus scale and CGI (p=0.007 and 0.0247, respectively). Akathisia and tardive dyskinesia did not differ between the two groups (p=0.601; p=0.507, respectively). These results suggest the role of 5HT2 antagonism in the mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotics with respect to lowering rates of drug-induced EPS. In addition, a therapeutic role for nefazodone is suggested in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced EPS.",3,E

The primary measure of efficacy was the change in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.; Of the 554 patients who were enrolled, 400 entered the double-blind study, and 370 received at least one postbaseline assessment. Mean changes in score of -6.2, -8.5, and -7.4 on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were seen at endpoint for the 25-, 50-, and 75-mg risperidone groups, respectively; all three change scores were significantly different from that seen with placebo (+2.6). Improvements in positive and negative symptoms were also significantly greater in patients receiving risperidone. Long-acting risperidone was well tolerated.

This study examines the effect size of symptom exacerbation during drug washout with placebo and the effects of drug washout on the efficacy of subsequent drug treatment.; Fifty patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia hospitalized on a research unit participated in a double-blind longitudinal study of the effects of drug washout after chronic treatment with a typical antipsychotic and before prospective treatment with clozapine. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores were analyzed to examine drug effects and effect sizes for baseline treatment with a typical antipsychotic (>6 months treatment), drug washout with placebo (mean=34 days), early treatment with clozapine (mean=42 days, mean dose=345.0 mg/day), and optimal clozapine treatment (mean=83 days, mean dose=450.5 mg/day).; Patients' BPRS total, positive, and negative symptom scores significantly increased during placebo washout, compared with baseline treatment, and significantly decreased with administration of clozapine, compared with placebo washout and baseline treatment. However, 30% of patients showed some symptom improvement during placebo washout. The effect sizes for the BPRS total score were 0.63 for baseline treatment versus placebo washout, 1.10 for optimal clozapine treatment versus placebo washout, and 0.82 for optimal clozapine treatment versus baseline treatment.; Symptom exacerbation induced by drug withdrawal in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia did not impede subsequent responsiveness to clozapine. The effect size for clozapine, compared with typical antipsychotics, suggests that the drug-washout longitudinal design is useful for establishing a drug-free baseline and for investigating drug response, while requiring relatively few subjects.",I,4

The extension phase of this study lasted for another 16 weeks, for a total of 24 weeks of prospective treatment. During this study phase, subjects were openly treated, and they could have their acute-phase mood stabilizer switched or augmented with another mood stabilizer, a stimulant, an antidepressant agent, or antipsychotic agent, if they were assessed to be a nonresponder to monotherapy with their initial mood stabilizer.; During the extension phase of treatment, 20 of 35 subjects (58%) required treatment with one or two mood stabilizers and either a stimulant, an atypical antipsychotic agent, or an antidepressant agent. The response rate to combination therapy was very good, with 80% of subjects treated responding to combination therapy with two mood stabilizers after not responding to monotherapy with a mood stabilizer.; This study suggests that children and adolescents with bipolar disorder are similar to adults with bipolar disorder, who also frequently require combination therapy.",3,E

STEP-BD, like all effectiveness research, faces many design challenges, including how to do the following: recruit a representative sample of patients for studies of readily available treatments; implement a common intervention strategy across diverse settings; determine outcomes for patients in multiple phases of illness; make provisions for testing as yet undetermined new treatments; integrate adjunctive psychosocial interventions; and avoid biases due to subject drop-out and last-observation-carried-forward data analyses. To meet these challenges, STEP-BD uses a hybrid design to collect longitudinal data as patients make transitions between naturalistic studies and randomized clinical trials. Bipolar patients of every subtype with age >/= 15 years are accessioned into a study registry. All patients receive a systematic assessment battery at entry and are treated by a psychiatrist (trained to deliver care and measure outcomes in patients with bipolar disorder) using a series of model practice procedures consistent with expert recommendations. At every follow-up visit, the treating psychiatrist completes a standardized assessment and assigns an operationalized clinical status based on DSM-IV criteria. Patients have independent evaluations at regular intervals throughout the study and remain under the care of the same treating psychiatrist while making transitions between randomized care studies and the standard care treatment pathways. This article reviews the methodology used for the selection and certification of the clinical treatment centers, training study personnel, the general approach to clinical management, and the sequential treatment strategies offered in the STEP-BD standard and randomized care pathways for bipolar depression and relapse prevention.",5,E

Data taken from clinical trials and observational data studies are used. Changes in annual health care costs, schizophrenia symptom days, extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) days, suicide rates, and employment days are estimated. For each 1,000 people treated with typical drugs, the base case scenario gives estimates of annual medical care costs of dollar 28.9 million with 80,253 moderate/severe schizophrenia symptom days and 92,006 EPS days. In the base case scenario, after switching to atypical drugs, schizophrenia symptom days are estimated to decrease up to 33 percent, EPS days up to 50 percent, and total medical care costs up to 19 percent over the 3-year period. Suicide rates fall and employment rates increase. The direction of the impacts remain the same for a wide range of input parameter values used in sensitivity analyses. Thus, switching to atypical drugs will likely reduce total medical care costs and decrease other disease burdens for people with schizophrenia, their families, and society.",5,E

It has been suggested that SGAs seem falsely more efficacious than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) as a result of reduced efficacy due to use of a high-dose comparator, haloperidol. We performed (1) a meta-analysis of randomized efficacy trials comparing SGAs and FGAs, (2) comparisons between SGAs, (3) a dose-response analysis of FGAs and SGAs, and (4) an analysis of the effect on efficacy of an overly high dose of an FGA comparator.; Literature search of clinical trials between January 1953 and May 2002 of patients with schizophrenia from electronic databases, reference lists, posters, the Food and Drug Administration, and other unpublished data.

The hypothesis tested was that relative to placebo, atypicals as a general class of medication would elicit cognitive improvement in SC. In all, 19 patients with SC (15 males) completed the double-blind, counterbalanced, randomized within-subject study of the effects of atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, clozapine, olanzapine, or quetiapine) vs placebo administration upon cognitive performance in the domains of executive function, attention, memory, language, visual perception, and general intellect. Significant cognitive improvement during atypical antipsychotic administration relative to placebo withdrawal occurred in most cognitive domains with robust improvements in intelligence (p=0.001), memory (p=0.0009), and fluency (p <0.002) even after outliers and unmotivated performances were excluded.

There are several phenomenologically distinct types of TS.; The term tardive dyskinesia has been used to refer to the TS that presents with rapid, repetitive, stereotypic movements mostly involving the oral, buccal, and lingual areas. Tardive dystonia can be focal, segmental, or generalized. It commonly affects the face and neck followed by the arms and trunk. It usually results in retrocollis when it involves the neck and trunk arching backwards when it involves the trunk. Tardive akathisia is characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and jitteriness with an inability to sit or stand still. Other tardive syndromes include tardive tics, myoclonus, tremor, and withdrawal-emergent syndrome. It remains unclear whether tardive parkinsonism truly exists. The only way to prevent TS is to avoid its etiologic agents. Chronic use of dopamine receptor blocking agents should be limited as much as possible to patients with chronic psychoses. In general, for mild TS, reducing the neuroleptic dose, switching to an atypical agent, or discontinuing antipsychotic treatment altogether in the hope of facilitating remission is recommended. For moderate to severe TS, tetrabenazine or reserpine may be the most effective agent. Neuroleptics should be resumed to treat TD in the absence of active psychosis only as a last resort for persistent, disabling, and treatment-resistant TD.; The severity of the TS and the absolute need for antipsychotic therapy often dictate the treatment approach for this disorder.",5,E

Much of the caution derives from animal studies (and limited human data) with regard to typical antipsychotics. Of note, however, is that similar assumptions have been made about the newer generation of atypical antipsychotics as well. Because these agents have different mechanisms of action as well as different neurotransmitter targets, this may very well be unwarranted. In this article, mechanisms of action of typical and atypical antipsychotics are discussed, with particular attention paid to their use in TBI. Indications and contraindications are presented, and recommendations are made for the responsible prescribing of antipsychotic medications after TBI.",5,E

Significant decreases in mean 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores from baseline (12.2+/-7.7) to week 3 (-5.7, P<0.0001) and week 12 (-5.7, P<0.0001) were also observed. No significant changes in extrapyramidal symptoms were noted between baseline and endpoint. The mean daily dose of risperidone was 2 mg with a median of 1.8 mg. These findings support the results of the two previous double-blind, randomized trials and indicate that the addition of risperidone to mood stabilizers is a safe and effective treatment for acute and continuation treatment of mania. Risperidone add-on does not induce depressive symptoms and, furthermore, risperidone may have efficacy in treating comorbid depressive symptoms in bipolar patients.",5,E

We found 13 reports of haloperidol-associated hyperglycemia and 11 reports of acidosis without hyperglycemia. Of the reports of risperidone-associated hyperglycemia (monotherapy), 78 patients had newly diagnosed hyperglycemia, 46 had exacerbated preexisting diabetes, and 7 could not be classified. Mean +/- SD age was 39.8 +/- 17.4 years (range 8-96 yrs). Patients with new-onset diabetes (mean +/- SD age 34.8 +/- 15.7 yrs) were younger than those with preexisting diabetes (mean +/- SD age 48.8 +/- 17.5 yrs). The overall male:female ratio was 1.5. In most patients, hyperglycemia appeared within 3 months of the start of risperidone therapy. Severity of disease ranged from mild glucose intolerance to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma. Twenty-six patients with acidosis or ketosis were reported. Four patients died.; Atypical antipsychotic treatment may unmask or precipitate hyperglycemia. Although such cases attributed to clozapine or olanzapine are more numerous than those associated with risperidone, the number for risperidone-associated hyperglycemia is relatively higher than that observed with the conventional neuroleptic haloperidol.",I,6

These factors are thought to affect the diagnoses, courses of treatment, and medical utilization patterns of patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, the differences between whites, African Americans, and Mexican Americans are of particular importance, as these groups comprise the majority of the population in the United States today. The traditional course of treatment for many patients with schizophrenia is the drug haloperidol. However, research has shown that some ethnic groups (African Americans and Mexican Americans) may respond better to atypical drugs, such as olanzapine, but may be less likely to receive these drugs. A better response to the course of treatment results in improved medical utilization patterns. The purpose of this study was to examine if ethnicity helped predict whether Texas Medicaid patients were prescribed haloperidol versus olanzapine when other factors were controlled for.; The study population consisted of 726 patients whose index drug was haloperidol and 1875 patients whose index drug was olanzapine. Patients had an ICD-9-CM diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Texas medical and prescription claims data were used in a logistic regression analysis to determine significant predictors of the type of antipsychotic (haloperidol vs. olanzapine) patients were prescribed. Variables included in the analysis were ethnicity, gender, age, region, other mental illness comorbidities, and previous utilization of medications and resources. Data were collected from Jan. 1, 1996, to Aug. 31, 1998.; The results show that when other demographic and utilization factors were controlled for, African Americans were less likely than whites to receive olanzapine rather than haloperidol.; Ethnicity is a significant predictor of the type of antipsychotic that is prescribed.",I,2

The mean olanzapine dose was 6.65 mg/day; for risperidone, the dose was 1.47 mg/day. The positive drug effect was not accompanied by decreased mobility, and there was improvement on a quality-of-life measure. The chief adverse events were drowsiness and falls. At baseline, 42% (16/38) of subjects in both groups had extrapyramidal symptoms that increased slightly, but not significantly, by the end of the study.; Low-dose, once-a-day olanzapine and risperidone appear to be equally safe and equally effective in the treatment of dementia-related behavioral disturbances in residents of extended care facilities.",I,I

Ten hospitalized schizophrenic and 10 schizoaffective patients receiving clozapine maintenance therapy with partial therapeutic response were studied in a randomized controlled trial. CGI and PANSS outcome ratings were employed and a cognitive battery was administered at baseline and after 4 weeks of lithium and placebo administration. Barnes and UKU side effect ratings and laboratory safety data were obtained. Combined lithium-clozapine treatment was well tolerated except for reversible neurotoxic reactions in two schizophrenic patients. Safety measures showed no significant variations, even during lithium toxicity. Total WBC and absolute granulocyte counts increased with lithium and declined with placebo. Schizoaffective patients improved with lithium on CGI and PANSS total and negative symptom scales and the cognitive measures, whereas schizophrenic patients did not. Lithium added to clozapine in treatment regimens for hospitalized, treatment-resistant, schizoaffective patients appears to afford potential benefit without harmful effects; for schizophrenic patients, however, it did not afford improvement but posed a risk of lithium toxicity.",4,E

Mirtazapine is structurally and pharmacologically similar to mianserin, and the authors sought to determine its anti-NIA activity. Twenty-six neuroleptic-treated schizophrenic patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of NIA received add-on mirtazapine (15 mg/day) or placebo for 5 days in a double-blind design. Patients were assessed at baseline and days 3 and 5 with the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS), Positive and Negative Symptom Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Simpson-Angus Scale for parkinsonism. Analysis of covariance with repeated measurements revealed significant group x time effects in favor of the mirtazapine group in both completers (n = 10 in each group) and intent-to-treat analysis (n = 13 in each group) for the BAS global subscale (F [1, 17] = 14.87, p = 0.001, and F [1, 23] = 13.24, p = 0.01, respectively) and objective subscale (F [1, 17] = 8.25, p = 0.011, and F [1, 23] = 7.35, p = 0.012, respectively) and borderline significant superiority for the BAS subjective subscale (F [1, 17] = 4.39, p = 0.051, and F [1, 23] = 4.12, p = 0.054, respectively) and distress subscale (F [1, 17] = 4.21, p = 0.056, and F [1, 23] = 3.80, p = 0.064, respectively).

Mirtazapine treatment was associated with modest improvement of psychotic and parkinsonian symptoms. Mild sedation was the only side effect. Our study demonstrated that mirtazapine (15 mg/day) is an efficacious and well-tolerated therapeutic option in NIA. Marked 5HT2A/2C antagonistic activity of mirtazapine apparently accounts for its anti-NIA activity. The role of mirtazapine in the treatment of akathisia induced by atypical antipsychotic agents merits further investigation.",3,E

Data on relapse, general treatment failure, and dropout due to adverse events were extracted and combined in a meta-analysis.; Because few trials were available for each individual drug, the effects of new-generation antipsychotic drugs as a group were analyzed. The analysis of six placebo comparisons, involving a total of 983 patients, clearly demonstrated that new-generation antipsychotic drugs are effective for relapse prevention. Eleven studies with a total of 2,032 patients provided comparative data on relapse/treatment failure for new-generation and conventional antipsychotics. The analysis revealed that rates of relapse and overall treatment failure were modestly but significantly lower with the newer drugs. Whether this advantage was partly mediated by improved adherence to treatment remains unclear. No significant superiority in terms of fewer dropouts due to adverse events was found for the newer drugs. Furthermore, a number of methodological problems were identified.; Overall, the currently available data suggest that new-generation antipsychotics have the potential to reduce relapse rates. Methodological issues to be addressed in future trials include the choice of comparator, use of appropriate doses, application of clinically relevant relapse criteria, monitoring of adherence, and minimization of dropouts.",I,I

To assess post-hoc the effects of prolactin concentrations upon switching to olanzapine treatment, patients were divided into three different groups, based upon status at time of consent: those not taking antipsychotic medication, those taking any conventional antipsychotic, and those taking risperidone. Prolactin concentrations were assessed using a mixed-effect repeated-measures model. Symptom severity was measured using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity scale, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the same repeated measures analysis was performed on these scales.; Patients not on antipsychotic medication at study entry (29 females, 7 males) experienced a significant increase in prolactin concentration baseline to endpoint (P < 0.05) but remained below upper limit of normal for prolactin for both males and females. There was a nonsignificant increase in prolactin concentrations when patients were switched from conventional antipsychotic medications (mean dose 152.41 +/- 192.48 mg/day chlorpromazine equivalents) to olanzapine (2.5 to 10 mg/day) (22 females, 9 males). Patients who entered the study on risperidone (mean dose 1.31 +/- 0.91 mg/day) (13 females, 4 males) experienced a significant decrease in prolactin concentration (P < 0.001).

Clear correlations between prolactin concentrations and clinical outcomes could not be determined.; Consistent with previous findings in younger patients, olanzapine appeared to be a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic medication in the elderly with only modest prolactin increases observed. In addition, patients who were receiving risperidone and then switched to olanzapine experienced a significant reduction in prolactin concentrations that was sustained over the 8-week treatment course with olanzapine. One possible explanation for olanzapine's relatively modest increase in prolactin is that, unlike conventionals or risperidone, olanzapine binds less tightly with the dopamine D(2) receptor.",7,E

It has been proven effective and significantly superior to placebo, as well as to conventional neuroleptics, in several placebo-controlled, double-blind studies in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. It has also been found to produce an incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) as low as that found with placebo. Approximately 30-60% of all schizophrenic patients who fail to respond to typical antipsychotics may respond to clozapine. It was the first major advance that marked a turning point in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders since the introduction of the typical antipsychotic agents, i.e., chlorpromazine and haloperidol in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. After its introduction in clinical studies in the United States in the early 1970s, it was withdrawn in 1974, and was not approved for clinical use in the United States until February 1990, because of the risk of agranulocytosis. Its novel pharmacological profile, lack of propensity to cause EPS in both short- and long-term uses, lack of effects on serum prolactin, and ameliorative effects on tardive dyskinesia have resulted in the expansion of its use from refractory schizophrenia to schizoaffective disorders, affective disorders, some neurological disorders, aggression, as well as psychosis in patients with dementia and parkinsonism.

However, quite surprisingly this area has received very little attention and has not been studied in clinical trials until recently. Thus, tremendous variability exists in approaches to agitation. In this work, we review what is known about the pharmacologic management of agitation; first, by examining published studies comparing conventional antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and/or a combination of both to achieve calm in acutely agitated psychiatric patients; and second, by reviewing available data on the use of atypical antipsychotic medications for the acute treatment of agitation associated with psychiatric illness. In our first review, we identified 11 trials meeting our inclusion criteria, 8 with a blind design. These studies taken together suggest that combination treatment may be superior to either agent alone, with higher improvement rates and lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects. In our review of atypical antipsychotic agents as acute antiagitation compounds, we identified 5 studies, 3 with a blind design. This review found atypical antipsychotics to be as effective as the classical ones and more advantageous. Based on the data available to date, among the present novel antipsychotic agents, ziprasidone, risperidone, and olanzapine seem to be the best acute antiagitation compounds.",1,E

In all, 93.1% (122/131) of olanzapine-treated patients and 92.1% (116/126) of haloperidol-treated patients completed the IM period and entered the PO period; 85.5% (112/131) of olanzapine-treated patients and 84.1% (106/126) of haloperidol-treated patients completed the PO period. IM olanzapine and IM haloperidol effectively reduced agitation over 24 hours (mean [SD] PANSS-EC change, -7.1 [4.81 vs -6.7 [4.3], respectively). Reductions in agitation were sustained throughout the PO period with both study drugs (mean [SD] change from PO period baseline, -0.6 [4.8] vs -1.3 [4.4], respectively). During PO treatment, haloperidol-treated patients spontaneously reported significantly more acute dystonia than olanzapine-treated patients (4.3%[5/116] vs 0% [0/122], respectively; P = 0.026) and akathisia (5.2% [6/116] vs 0% [0/122], respectively; P = 0.013). Significantly more haloperidol-treated patients than olanzapine-treated patients met categorical criteria for treatment-emergent akathisia (18.5% [17/92] vs 6.5% [7/107], respectively; P = 0.015).; In the acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia in this study, both IM olanzapine 10 mg and IM haloperidol 7.5 mg effectively reduced agitation over 24 hours. This alleviation of agitation was sustained following transition from IM therapy to 4 days of PO treatment (5-20 mg/d for both). During the 4 days of PO treatment, olanzapine-treated patients did not spontaneously report any incidences of acute dystonia, and olanzapine had a superior EPS safety profile to that of haloperidol. The combination of IM and PO olanzapine may help improve the treatment of acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia.",3,E

The present study assessed whether quetiapine (Seroquel) is more effective than haloperidol in treating depressive symptoms in patients with persistent positive symptoms, and investigated whether this effect is independent, or secondary to, reductions in other symptoms such as positive, negative or extrapyramidal symptoms. Patients with schizophrenia and a history of partial refractoriness to conventional antipsychotics who had not responded to 4 weeks of fluphenazine treatment (20 mg/day) were randomized to receive either quetiapine (600 mg/day) or haloperidol (20 mg/day) for a further 8 weeks. Change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale depression factor score from baseline to endpoint was calculated and path analyses were performed on data from 269 patients. Quetiapine produced a greater reduction in depressive scores than haloperidol (-1.60 versus -0.54; p = 0.006). The path analyses indicated that this was a direct effect on depressive symptoms. These findings extend the evidence for an antidepressant effect for the novel antipsychotics in schizophrenia, and suggest that this is not limited to acutely psychotic patients.",I,I

The present study tested the hypothesis that olanzapine may be differentially effective at reducing cue-elicited craving based on individual differences in DRD4 VNTR in a sample of heavy social drinkers. Participants were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (5 mg) or a control medication (cyproheptadine, 4 mg) prior to consuming three alcoholic drinks. Participants completed subjective measures of craving and euphoria after each drink. Participants who were homozygous or heterozygous for the 7 (or longer) repeat allele of the DRD4 VNTR were classified as DRD4 L, while the other participants were classified as DRD4 S. The findings indicated that olanzapine reduces craving for alcohol at baseline for both DRD4 S and DRD4 L individuals, but only reduces craving after exposure to alcohol cues and after a priming dose of alcohol for DRD4 L individuals.",4,E

Meta-regression analysis was performed to investigate sources of heterogeneity.; Ten trials were examined. Recent large-scale studies have not found a substantial advantage for clozapine, especially in terms of a clinically relevant effect. Meta-regression showed that shorter study duration, financial support from a drug company and higher baseline symptom score consistently predicted greater advantage of clozapine.; It may be inappropriate to combine studies in meta-analysis, given the degree of heterogeneity between their findings. The benefits of clozapine compared with conventional treatment may not be substantial.",5,E

This study compared the acute and long-term effectiveness of haloperidol with that of olanzapine in patients with first-episode psychosis in a large, controlled clinical trial.; Patients with first-episode psychosis (N=263) were randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to receive haloperidol or olanzapine and were followed for up to 104 weeks. Domains measured included psychopathology, psychosocial variables, neurocognitive functioning, and brain morphology and metabolism. This report presents data from clinical measures of treatment response and safety data from the 12-week acute treatment phase.; Haloperidol and olanzapine were associated with substantial and comparable baseline-to-endpoint reductions in symptom severity, which did not differ significantly in last-observation-carried-forward analyses. However, in a mixed-model analysis, olanzapine-treated subjects had significantly greater decreases in symptom severity as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score and negative and general scales and by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale but not as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive scale and by the Clinical Global Impression severity rating. Olanzapine-treated patients experienced a lower rate of treatment-emergent parkinsonism and akathisia but had significantly more weight gain, compared with the haloperidol-treated patients. Overall, significantly more olanzapine-treated subjects than haloperidol-treated subjects completed the 12-week acute phase of the study (67% versus 54%).; As expected on the basis of previous studies, both olanzapine and haloperidol were effective in the acute reduction of psychopathological symptoms in this group of patients with first-episode psychosis. However, olanzapine had several relative advantages in therapeutic response. Although the nature of adverse events differed between the two agents, retention in the study was greater with olanzapine. Retention in treatment is important in this patient population, given their risk of relapse.

Study patients also received 15 months of standard behavioral skills training or enhanced training with a case manager who promoted patients' use of their skills in the community.; The risk of psychotic exacerbations and the risk of leaving the study were similar for both drug treatment groups. However, patients who received both risperidone and the enhanced community-based skills training were more likely to remain in the study than those in the other treatment groups. Patients demonstrated significant improvement in score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale over time with both medications. There were no between-group differences in cluster scores for thought disturbance, hostile-suspiciousness, and withdrawal-retardation. A significant between-group difference favoring risperidone was found for the anxious-depression cluster.

The CATIE schizophrenia trial blends features of efficacy studies and large, simple trials to create a pragmatic trial that will provide extensive information about antipsychotic drug effectiveness over at least 18 months. The protocol allows for subjects who receive a study drug that is not effective to receive subsequent treatments within the context of the study. Medication dosages are adjusted within a defined range according to clinical judgment. The primary outcome is all-cause treatment discontinuation because it represents an important clinical endpoint that reflects both clinician and patient judgments about efficacy and tolerability. Secondary outcomes include symptoms, side effects, neurocognitive functioning, and cost-effectiveness. Approximately 50 clinical sites across the United States are seeking to enroll a total of 1,500 persons with schizophrenia. Phase 1 is a double-blinded randomized clinical trial comparing treatment with the second generation antipsychotics olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone to perphenazine, a midpotency first generation antipsychotic. If the initially assigned medication is not effective, subjects may choose one of the following phase 2 trials: (1) randomization to open-label clozapine or a double-blinded second generation drug that was available but not assigned in phase 1; or (2) double-blinded randomization to ziprasidone or another second generation drug that was available but not assigned in phase 1. If the phase 2 study drug is discontinued, subjects may enter phase 3, in which clinicians help subjects select an open-label treatment based on individuals' experiences in phases 1 and 2.",I,I

In three studies we reexamined data from a clinical trial of haloperidol and clozapine conducted from 1993 to 1996. The results of the studies are as follows: Study 1 found that clozapine treatment was associated with significantly reduced inpatient costs, and increased outpatient costs, suggesting that as systems use less inpatient care and more outpatient care, more effective medications may increase, rather than decrease, costs in sicker patients. Study 2 found that while provider assessments and standard measures favored clozapine over haloperidol, patient responses showed little evidence of a clinical advantage for clozapine and a less favorable side-effect profile. Study 3 found that while annual drug costs in the published trial were estimated to be dollars 4,545 for a full year of clozapine treatment, atypical antipsychotic costs in 2000 were estimated to range from dollars 1,254 to dollars 3,016 in the Department of Veterans Affairs system, and from dollars 2,221 to dollars 8,147 in the private sector. In conclusion, cost-effectiveness, as evaluated in studies like CATIE, will increasingly need to be tied to service system contingencies, environments, and evaluation perspectives.",5,E

Systematic reviews have revealed only modest advantages over conventional antipsychotics and uncertainty about long-term efficacy and safety, yet the second generation antipsychotic drugs have been widely accepted into clinical practice. Although the existing evidence of the benefits and harms of atypical antipsychotics can facilitate decision making about individual patients, the randomized evidence remains inadequate to make valid and fully evidence-based policy statements such as clinical practice guidelines that are designed to apply to groups of patients. Further large randomized trials are needed, but these require patients and clinicians to be in equipoise, or substantially uncertain, about alternative therapies.

A priori predictors related to diagnosis, treatment resistance, and clinical constructs of disease symptoms were evaluated as possible predictors of subsequent suicide-related events.; Ten baseline univariate predictors were identified. Historical predictors were diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, history or current use at baseline of alcohol or substance abuse, cigarette smoking, number of lifetime suicide attempts, and the number of hospitalizations in the previous 36 months to prevent suicide. Predictive clinical features included greater baseline scores on the InterSePT scale for suicidal thinking, the Covi Anxiety Scale, the Calgary Depression Scale (CDS), and severity of Parkinsonism. Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed the number of hospitalizations in the previous 36 months, baseline CDS, severity of Parkinson's, history of substance abuse, and lifetime suicide attempts. Clozapine, in general, was more effective than olanzapine in decreasing the risk of suicidality, regardless of risk factors present.; This is the first prospective analysis of predictors of suicide risk in a large schizophrenic and schizoaffective population judged to be at high risk for suicide.

At the end of the 1st clozapine trial, the correlation with the levels explained 69% of the variance of serum antimuscarinic activity (r = 0.83, P < 0.001, N = 34). Clozapine levels were good predictors of serum antimuscarinic activity only in patients taking 300 or 600 mg/d.

Agitation presents a barrier to therapy, interrupting the typical physician-patient alliance and creating a disruptive, even hazardous, environment. Rapid assessment and effective treatment are necessary to manage agitation and, potentially, to shorten the time to recovery.; One hundred forty-eight acutely agitated patients received either: rapid initial dose escalation (RIDE) in which up to 40 mg of oral olanzapine was allowed on days 1 and 2, up to 30 mg on days 3 and 4, and 5 to 20 mg thereafter; or usual clinical practice (UCP) in which patients received 10 mg/d olanzapine plus up to 4 mg lorazepam on days 1 and 2, up to 2 mg on days 3 and 4, and olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/d thereafter.

Secondary assessments of agitation and safety were also performed.; Agitation improved significantly from baseline for both treatment groups; however, improvement with the RIDE strategy was superior to UCP. The RIDE group improvement was superior on the primary efficacy measure (PANSS-Excited) at 24 hours; it was superior on all agitation measures at the end of double-blind treatment. Both treatments were well tolerated, with no clinically significant differences in safety measures. Treatment was not limited by oversedation and attention improved from baseline in both groups.; This study demonstrates the value of olanzapine in the treatment of acutely agitated patients.

Olanzapine and placebo responses paralleled closely (r(s) = 0.73). Patients were relatively more responsive to olanzapine who were younger at illness onset, lacked prior substance abuse, and had not previously received antipsychotic treatment (efficacy ratios 1.5-1.7, all P < 0.01). These well-powered comparisons of subgroups of interest indicate broad efficacy of olanzapine in the treatment of acute mania.",5,E

The Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effect Scale (SAS) and the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) were administered before and 7 and 24 hours after medication was given.; Compared with placebo, total motor activity was decreased by 41% with olanzapine (p = 0.004) and by 12% with haloperidol (NS). There were significantly more epochs with zero movement with olanzapine than with haloperidol or placebo. For non-zero epochs, the mean activity count and the distribution of activity counts did not differ significantly among groups. There were no positive findings on the SAS or the BAS.; Olanzapine decreased total motor activity by increasing the amount of time during which subjects were immobile, rather than by affecting the magnitude of movement during periods in which there was activity. This effect occurred at a dose of olanzapine low enough not to cause clinically observed extrapyramidal side effects. Our results suggest that actigraphy is useful as a sensitive, noninvasive tool for measuring the effect of antipsychotics on spontaneous motor activity.",4,E
12921492,Management of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia: new treatment options.,"Antipsychotic Agents; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Treatment Outcome","M枚ller, Hans-J眉rgen","This article presents a systematic review of pharmacological treatment for negative symptoms of schizophrenia, based on MEDLINE searches from 1995 to September 2002 to identify pertinent clinical trials. The pharmacotherapy of negative symptoms in schizophrenia includes novel/atypical antipsychotics and classical antipsychotics, as well as antidepressants, glutamatergic compounds, antiepileptic drugs and estrogens. In the assessment of therapy for negative symptoms of schizophrenia, it is imperative that better studies of sound methodology are performed. In such studies, some important aspects to be considered include an accurate definition and assessment of negative symptoms (including well designed, valid and reliable rating scales), the differentiation between primary and secondary negative symptoms, an appropriate selection of standard comparators, adequate dosages of comparators (e.g. haloperidol dosages) and an overall optimal study design. Most of the available studies on treating negative symptoms in schizophrenia have focused on the atypical antipsychotics, while other potential candidates, mostly in the context of add-on therapy, have not been so intensively investigated. Atypical antipsychotics have been proven in placebo-controlled trials to be effective in treating negative symptoms of acute schizophrenic episodes. In many of the comparator studies, they showed efficacy in treating negative symptoms that was superior to that of typical antipsychotics. Data on stable, predominant negative symptoms in subchronic or chronic cases of schizophrenia, although limited, have demonstrated the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics. If the beneficial tolerability profile with respect to extrapyramidal symptoms is also taken into account during clinical decision making, the atypical antipsychotics should be preferred for the treatment of negative symptoms. It is also worth noting that the traditional antipsychotics have the risk of inducing negative symptoms in the context of akinesia. The benefits of add-on therapy with SSRIs or a glutamatergic compound are well documented. Estrogen add-on therapy seems promising. Other traditionally suggested approaches, such as comedication with an antiepileptic drug, lithium or beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, cannot generally be recommended on the basis of the available data.",5,E

Imaging studies with verbal fluency tasks (VFT) lead some to suggest that in schizophrenia, the combination of a failure to deactivate the left temporal lobe and a hypoactive frontal lobe reflects a functional disconnectivity between the left prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe. Others have theorized that an abnormal cingulate gyrus modulates such fronto-temporal connectivity. Thus addition of a cognitive enhancing medication to current antipsychotic therapy might improve functionality of networks necessary in working memory and internal concept generation. To test this hypothesis, we serially measured brain activity in 6 subjects on stable atypical antipsychotics performing a VFT, using BOLD fMRI. Measurements were made at baseline and again after groups were randomized to receive 12 weeks of donepezil (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) and placebo in a blind cross-over design. Donepezil addition provided a functional normalization with an increase in left frontal lobe and cingulate activity when compared to placebo and from baseline scans. This pilot study supports the cingulate's role in modulating cognition and neuronal connectivity in schizophrenia.",3,E

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early efficacy of oral-loaded divalproex.; In this pooled analysis, 348 subjects from 3 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active- or placebo-controlled studies were used to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral-loaded divalproex with standard-titration divalproex, lithium, olanzapine, or placebo. Subjects were inpatients diagnosed with acute mania associated with bipolar I disorder (DSM-III-R or -IV and SADS-Change Version). Patients were administered oral-loaded divalproex (20 or 30 mg/kg/day on days 1 and 2 followed by 20 mg/kg/day, and increased at physician's discretion), standard-titration divalproex initiated at 250 mg t.i.d. and titrated to 40-150 microg/mL, lithium (300 mg t.i.d. initial dose) titrated to 0.4 to 1.5 mEq/L, olanzapine (10 mg q.d. initial dose) up to 20 mg/day, or placebo.; The results demonstrate an early efficacy advantage for oral-loaded divalproex compared to standard-titration divalproex at days 5, 7/8, and 10. Efficacy was improved over lithium on day 7/8. There were no efficacy differences between divalproex loading and olanzapine. Divalproex loading showed greater efficacy than placebo at all time points. Divalproex loading was as well tolerated or better tolerated than the other active treatments as measured by adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters.; These results suggest the oral loading of divalproex leads to a more rapid antimanic effect when compared with standard-titration divalproex, lithium, or placebo and is better tolerated than olanzapine and as well tolerated as lithium or standard-titration divalproex.",I,5

12973385,Quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel): a new atypical antipsychotic.,NA,"Goldstein, J M","The goal of antipsychotic drug development efforts over the past 10 years has been to develop agents with increased efficacy and safety and fewer of the side effects commonly associated with the older antipsychotic medications. The newer agents, often called atypical antipsychotics, are effective in treating both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and are associated with fewer neurological- and endocrine-related side effects compared to the older agents. As a result, patients are likely to remain on therapy longer, preventing relapses and costly hospitalizations. Quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel) is the most recently introduced atypical antipsychotic and is indicated for the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders and schizophrenia. Quetiapine, like clozapine (the archetypal atypical antipsychotic), interacts with a broad range of neurotransmitter receptors and has a higher affinity for serotonin (5-HT(2A)) receptors relative to dopamine (D(2)) receptors in the brain. Further, quetiapine's pharmacological effects appear selective for the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine systems, which are believed to be the areas of the brain responsible for the therapeutic effects of antipsychotics. In contrast to most standard antipsychotics and some atypical antipsychotics, quetiapine's effects on the nigrostriatal dopamine system, which is responsible for the extrapyramidal (or motor) side effects, are minimal. Quetiapine also has minimal activity on dopamine receptors in the tuberoinfundibular dopamine system, thereby avoiding the problem of hyperprolactinemia, common with the standard antipsychotics and some atypical antipsychotics. Because of these properties, quetiapine is an effective antipsychotic agent with a relatively benign side effect profile. Several large, placebo- and active-controlled, multicenter trials have shown quetiapine to be effective against both positive (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) and negative symptoms (e.g., emotional withdrawal, apathy) and to have benefits in reducing hostility, aggression and affective symptoms. Patients on long-term treatment report high compliance, good satisfaction, increased ability to function and improvements consistent with a better quality of life. Because of quetiapine's excellent tolerability profile, its use is particularly appropriate in patients especially sensitive to adverse effects, e.g., elderly patients with psychotic symptoms and other neurological disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.",5,E

However, in terms of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) almost only psychopharmacological treatments are available and psychosocial interventions such as OT had not proved to be effective. The aim of this study is to investigate if OT is effective when added to a psychopharmacological treatment in TRS.; Two groups of patients with TRS were compared: The experimental group (EG) received psychopharmacological treatment with clozapine plus sessions of occupational therapy (OT) and the control group (CG) received only clozapine. The Scale for Interactive Observation in Occupational Therapy (EOITO) was employed to evaluate the outcome. The duration of the study was 6 months and patients were rated at baseline and monthly totaling 7 assessments. EOITO was independently applied by two occupational therapists with high reliability rates (Kappa=0.90, p=0.001). Repeated measures of analyses of variance and the evaluation of the standardized effect sizes were used for statistical analyses.; The EG showed that the OT intervention was effective along the whole period of observation, mainly from the 4th month to the end of the study.; In patients with TRS the combination of OT and clozapine showed to be more effective than the use of clozapine alone.

Many studies sought allelic association of a 48-base-pair repeat in DRD4 exon 3 with schizophrenia, but found no strong evidence for a relationship. The present work sought to determine if this observation reflected the true absence of association or the low power of individual studies.; We performed four meta-analyses, sequentially considering the two-, four-, and seven-repeat alleles as risk alleles, and then considering repeat length of the 48-base-pair segment as a risk factor. Each meta-analysis included at least 2,300 cases and 2,100 controls from 14-16 studies.; The pooled odds ratio from each analysis approximated 1.0, and none were significant. Heterogeneity was not observed, although gender moderated the effects of repeat length and the seven-repeat allele.; Despite over 90% power to detect a significant odds ratio of 1.4 or less, none was observed. This polymorphism seems not to influence risk for most schizophrenia cases; however, a sex-dependent relationship, or a role in some clinical features of the disorder, cannot be excluded and should be pursued experimentally.",2,E

Sequentially described are pharmacotherapy studies of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge-eating disorder (BED). The quantity of drug trials performed with AN patients has been very limited. While the majority of studies have failed to show medication efficacy for the acute treatment of AN, there is data which suggests that fluoxetine hydrochloride may play a role in preventing relapse during maintenance therapy. Atypical antipsychotics, most often olanzapine, have shown promise in a number of uncontrolled studies. BN has been most extensively studied, with the majority of pharmacological trials focusing on antidepressants. Fluoxetine, at a dose of 60 mg/day, is FDA-approved for the treatment of BN. Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is of well-established utility in BN and data suggests that the combination of an antidepressant plus CBT is superior to either treatment alone. Recently, there has been interest in the 5-HT3 antagonist, ondansetron, and the anticonvulsant, topiramate. BED investigators have focused largely on antidepressants, which may reduce symptoms of depression and augment psychotherapy. While sibutramine and topiramate have both been associated with weight loss in controlled trials, the former appears to be fairly well-tolerated and the latter appears to be responsible for the emergence of significant cognitive and peripheral nervous system side effects in some patients. Further pharmacological research with eating disorder patients is needed, particularly in the areas of AN and BED. Also, pharmacological augmentation strategies for those not responding to primary therapies should be explored.",5,E

Anecdotal reports suggested that the use of cannabis might improve not only tics, but also behavioural problems in patients with TS. A single-dose, cross-over study in 12 patients, as well as a 6-week, randomised trial in 24 patients, demonstrated that Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the most psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, reduces tics in TS patients. No serious adverse effects occurred and no impairment on neuropsychological performance was observed. If well-established drugs either fail to improve tics or cause significant adverse effects, in adult patients, therapy with Delta9-THC should be tried. At present, it remains unclear whether herbal cannabis, different natural or synthetic cannabinoid CB1-receptor agonists or agents that interfere with the inactivation of endocannabinoids, may have the best adverse effect profile in TS.",5,E

The rates of switching into brief to full hypomania or mania during the use of antidepressants is described, and new data suggesting the potential utility of continuing antidepressants in the small group of patients showing an initial acute and persistent response is noted. Bipolar patients with a history of major environmental adversities in childhood have a more severe course of illness and an increased incidence of suicide attempts compared with those without. Preliminary open data suggest useful antidepressant effects of the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine, while a double-blind randomized controlled study failed to show efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids (6 g of eicosapentaenoic acid compared with placebo for 4 months) in the treatment of either acute depression or rapid cycling. The high prevalence of overweight and increased incidence of antithyroid antibodies in patients with bipolar illness is highlighted.; Together, these findings suggest a very high degree of comorbidity and treatment resistance in outpatients with bipolar illness treated in academic settings and the need to develop not only new treatment approaches, but also much earlier illness recognition, diagnosis, and intervention in an attempt to reverse or prevent this illness burden.",5,E

Side-effects caused discontinuation in three patients, but were rare and mild in the remaining 13. Improvement of global mental symptoms was noted in eight patients, whereas worsening was reported in four. Hallucinations improved in seven of the nine patients with hallucinations before treatment. Parkinsonism improved in six patients, but a mild worsening of tremor was noted in three. Clock-drawing improved (p=0.016), and trends towards improvement on MMSE (p=0.09) and verbal fluency (p=0.16) were found.; Although controlled trials are needed, the findings suggest that galantamine is useful in patients with PDD.",3,E

Six case reports are identified in the literature of pregnant patients who received clozapine. Novartis at Basle, Switzerland, through its pharmacovigilance and epidemiology, service, has data on nearly 200 cases summarized in this article. We also describe the case of a patient with paranoid schizophrenia who was hospitalized 10 times between the age of 22 to 32. She received clozapine when she was 29 years old and, with a daily dosage of 350 mg, she became asymptomatic. At the age of 33 and 37, she became pregnant and continued clozapine during her 2 pregnancies. During her first pregnancy, she received insulin due to gestational diabetes associated with a body weight mass (BWM) of 30.4 (N = 20 to 25). During her second pregnancy, the BWM was 23.7 and she did not develop diabetes. She delivered at term 2 daughters who are at the time of this report 5 and 3 years old. The two girls are doing well and have no developmental delay. Psychotic symptoms exacerbation: the plasma concentration of clozapine diminishes during pregnancy due to a higher hepatic metabolism and distribution volume. Monitoring plasma concentration of clozapine can help to adjust its dosage. In case of psychotic symptoms exacerbation, the following can be recommended: 1) Increase the clozapine dosage; 2) Add a classic antipsychotic like perphenazine, trifluoperazine or haloperidol. Diabetes: obesity, glucose intolerance or a family history of diabetes are risk factors to develop gestational diabetes. The follow-up of patients, who take an atypical antipsychotic, should include constant monitoring of the blood glucose or Hb1A and lipid dosages. Complications at labor: Clozapine increases the secretion of oxytocine and the contraction of the uterine muscle. But, no studies can explain how clozapine affects the labor exactly. Some case studies report use of forceps, vacuum or cesarean.; Stoner (1997) described neonatal convulsions 8 days after birth. The mother was receiving 350 mg of clozapine, but also lorazepam and haloperidol during her pregnancy. The newborn withdrawal of lorazepam can increase the risk of convulsions and also haloperidol can diminish the convulsion threshold. Floppy infant syndrome: in the case described by Dimichele (1996), the mother received a daily dosage of 300 mg of clozapine and 2.5 mg of lorazepam 3 to 5 times a day. This can explain hypotonia. Stoner (1997) reports a second case where a mother, who received 600 mg of clozapine during pregnancy, gave birth to a child who had no convulsions neither hypotonia.; The cases described concerning studies of children until age 2 to 3 years by Stoner (1997) and Dickson (1998) and until 6 years old by Barnas (1994), do not mention any developmental problem, similar to the two daughters of our patient. The pharmacovigilance service of Novarits reports 6% of malformations. But these reports must be considered with caution since they represent only the pregnancies reported spontaneously to the pharmaceutical company. This is only a portion of all pregnancies associated with clozapine.; No specific risks for the mother and children can be attributed to the use of clozapine during pregnancy. However, the plasma concentration of clozapine is higher in the fetus compared to the mother (Barnas, 1994); therefore, a minimal dosage should be used. Since clozapine is present in the maternal milk, breast feeding should be avoided. The advantages to use clozapine during pregnancy must exceed the risks. It is justified to continue the use of this medication even if data on classic antipsychotics (e.g.: haloperidol) are more extensive. Because the risk of psychotic exacerbation is higher, the substitution of clozapine is not recommended. The psychosocial support and the obstetrical follow-up must be intensive too. An institutional pharmacovigilance service should complement the one provided by the industry. Also, further case-control and cohort studies are essential to better estimate the long-term risks.",1,E

These symptoms are usually classified in syndromes, which include psychosis, depression, agitation and sleep disturbances. BPSD have a major impact on the clinical course, prognosis and the quality of life of patients and caregivers. Moreover, BPSD considerably increase the social costs of dementia, since they often result in institutionalization. The therapy of BPSD was initially based on an empirical syndromic approach. However, in more recent years the efficacy and safety of treatments for these conditions have been tested in several controlled clinical trials.

Olanzapine was also associated with more frequent reports of weight gain and significantly greater VA costs, ranging from 3000 dollars to 9000 dollars annually. Differences in societal costs were somewhat smaller and were not significant.; Olanzapine does not demonstrate advantages compared with haloperidol (in combination with prophylactic benztropine) in compliance, symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, or overall quality of life, and its benefits in reducing akathisia and improving cognition must be balanced with the problems of weight gain and higher cost.",I,I

Recent pilot studies report good clinical results with the atypical neuroleptic clozapine.; We report on 15 patients with Parkinsonian syndromes: 11 with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), 3 with multiple system atrophy (MSA) and 1 with postencephalitic Parkinsonism (SPP). The mean age was 68.8 +/- 10 years; the mean duration of Parkinsonian symptoms was 6.8 +/- 5.7 years. The Hoehn & Yahr grade was: 3.5 +/- 0.8.

There is a very substantial difference in the dosing regimen used on both continents and this is reflected in the studies reported. A question with major clinical implications is whether the higher doses commonly used in the United States lead to a better outcome or a different profile of side effects. Outcome as a function of serum concentration will be examined. Results confirm a lower dose, lower clozapine blood level, and a lesser degree of side effects in the Austrian cohort when compared to the American sample. Surprisingly, the clinical efficacy of the lower dosing regimen was superior to the higher dose. Reasons for this anomaly are explored.",5,E

At the one end, haloperidol presented as a potent and specific antagonist of the psychostimulants amphetamine and apomorphine. Haloperidol-like neuroleptics have marked effects on psychomotor agitation, delusions and hallucinations and bind with high affinity to dopamine-D2 receptors. Pipamperone, at the other end, presented with weak ""dopamine"" antagonism and more striking tryptamine antagonism. Pipamperone is known to improve disturbed sleep, social withdrawal and other symptoms of chronic schizophrenia in the relative absence of extrapyramidal symptoms. These effects have been attributed to central serotonin-S2 antagonism, on the basis of the clinical effects of ritanserin. As shown by the present analysis of relative tryptamine versus apomorphine antagonism of 57 neuroleptics, in comparison to relative S2 vs. D2 binding, there is a continuity in the series. About 30% of the compounds can be considered to act primarily as serotonin antagonists, but few are markedly more potent than pipamperone. In amphetamine-challenged rats pipamperone-like activity is reflected in preferential inhibition of the excessive oxygen consumption rather than of agitation. Risperidone inhibits oxygen consumption (0.016 mg/kg) at the same dose as haloperidol inhibits agitation. Other low-dose effects of risperidone include reversal of amphetamine-induced withdrawal, antagonism of agitation induced by a sequential tryptamine and apomorphine challenge and LSD-antagonism. In dogs, the antiemetic activity of risperidone is characterized by high oral effectiveness which lasts one day and agrees with pharmacokinetic data when allowance is made for the active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",5,E

Overall, risperidone in a dose of 4 mg a day was comparable to haloperidol in a dose of 10 mg a day. Risperidone was found to have a curvilinear dose-response curve with an optimum effect of 4 mg day on the negative, anxious/depressive and cognitive factors and with an optimum effect of 8 mg day on the positive and excited factors. While haloperidol had significant effects on the negative and anxious/depressive factors, risperidone had significant effects on all five factors - the positive, the negative, the excited, the anxious/depressive and the cognitive. The fact that the novel drug had significant effects on the cognitive factor might be of great importance as concerns the possibilities for rehabilitation of chronic schizophrenic patients.",I,I

While clozapine differs from traditional neuroleptics in its lack of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), it also is distinct in its profile of neurotransmitter receptor affinities. In our work examining the clinical and biological effects of clozapine in patients with schizophrenia, we have identified the presence of EPS during typical neuroleptic treatment as a consistent predictor of subsequent good response to clozapine. Further, our data suggest that clozapine should not be reserved for the most chronically ill patients, but rather be utilized in patients with less chronic courses of schizophrenia.

Development of the drug was stimulated by reports that the selective serotonin 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin improved the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and decreased extrapyramidal symptoms when combined with haloperidol. The relatively low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone may reflect a preferential action on mesolimbic rather than nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. Recent clinical investigation suggests that risperidone is of at least comparable efficacy to haloperidol and perphenazine in improving the symptoms of acute and chronic schizophrenia on short term administration. Advantages offered by risperidone over haloperidol include a faster onset of antipsychotic action, a lower incidence of extrapyramidal effects and possibly greater efficacy against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

Supersensitivity psychosis (SSP) has emerged as a potential side effect of long-term neuroleptic therapy similar to tardive dyskinesia (TD). 2. Six schizophrenic patients with SSP, considered to be drug-resistant, were treated with risperidone, while another 5 were treated with clozapine. 3. The 6 risperidone-treated patients (all women) were rated on the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale as at least very much improved. Among the 5 clozapine-treated patients, all 4 men were found to have a marked response to clozapine, while the female patient was judged to be minimally improved. 4. It is hypothesized that not only TD but also SSP arise from destruction of cholinergic interneurons in the striatum as a consequence of prolonged neuroleptic administration. Thus, the drug-induced parkinsonism, which was proposed as mediating the antipsychotic effect of dopamine D2 blocking drugs, depends on the integrity of these cholinergic neurons. If these neurons are destroyed, drugs such as haloperidol lose their therapeutic effect. 5. In contrast, atypical neuroleptics like clozapine and risperidone reduce dopamine release in the striatum independently of prior production of extrapyramidal symptoms and, in this way, may be effective in psychotic illnesses unresponsive to classical anti-D2 neuroleptics. 6.

It is unclear whether these properties relate to weak dopamine D2 receptor blockade in vivo, as has been suggested for the archetypal atypical antipsychotic clozapine. We have used 123I-IBZM single photon emission tomography (SPET) to characterize the patterns of striatal D2 receptor binding in vivo in DSMIII-R-diagnosed schizophrenic and schizo-affective patients treated with either risperidone (n = 6) or remoxipride (n = 4) but predominantly EPS free. These groups were compared to age- and BPRS- matched subjects from a previously reported D2 receptor binding database of patients treated with clozapine (n = 10) and classical antipsychotics (n = 10). Patients on risperidone and remoxipride had high levels of D2 receptor blockade, comparable to those of patients on classical antipsychotics, and significantly greater than those obtained with clozapine-treated patients (risperidone versus clozapine, P < 0.005; remoxipride versus clozapine, P < 0.025). These results suggest high levels of striatal D2 receptor occupancy in association with remoxipride and risperidone treatment and argue against modest D2 antagonism as the explanation for the low incidence of EPS associated with these drugs.",2,E

This results in a drug that is both clinically effective, reducing positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and has a low incidence of adverse effects. At a dosage of 4 to 8 mg/day, risperidone is comparable to 10 mg/day of haloperidol. This dosage has a low incidence of extrapyramidal adverse effects and is nonsedative, although it may cause orthostatic hypotension. There is no current evidence for specific biochemical and haematological abnormalities associated with risperidone. Although the clinical benefits appear to outweigh the risks, this drug continues to be a relatively expensive treatment option in the UK. There is therefore a need for a formal cost-utility assessment of risperidone and for comparisons between this drug and other atypical neuroleptics.",6,E

The mean daily doses of risperidone and zuclopenthixol at the end of the trial were 8 mg and 38 mg respectively. Efficacy was assessed throughout by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for schizophrenia and Clinical Global Impression. Safety assessments included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, UKU Side-Effect Rating Scale, vital signs, body weight and laboratory screening. The results indicate that risperidone is at least as effective as zuclopenthixol for the treatment of acute schizophrenic episodes, with a trend towards greater improvement in the overall severity of symptoms. The onset of action was significantly shorter with risperidone than with zuclopenthixol.

Two studies on iloperidone evaluated its safety and tolerability, made a preliminary pharmacokinetic assessment of single 3- and 5-mg doses, and determined the effect of food on its tolerability and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers after single 3-mg doses. Iloperidone was well absorbed orally in fasted subjects. The Cmax occurred approximately 2 to 3 hours after administration of a single 3- or 5-mg dose. The pharmacokinetic parameters increased with the dose between 3 and 5 mg (from 2.2 to 5.2 ng/mL for Cmax, and 16 to 50 ng/mL.h for AUC). Iloperidone was eliminated slowly, with a mean t1/2 of 13.5 to 14.0 hours. Coadministration with food did not significantly affect AUC, tmax, or Cmax. These results indicate that the rate of iloperidone's absorption is decreased, but the overall bioavailability is unchanged, when the drug is taken with food. Orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and somnolence were the most commonly reported adverse events. Coadministration of food reduced the incidence and severity of these events.",3,E

Change in hostility served as a dependent variable in the analyses. Change in ""psychosis"" was applied as a covariate; it helped us examine changes in hostility that were unrelated to change in psychosis (selective effect).

We hypothesized that the dose required to give a putative threshold therapeutic concentration of 350 micrograms/L could be individualized using pharmacokinetic predictions made at the beginning of normal dose escalation. Low-dose clozapine (25-75 mg every 12 h) was administered to 21 treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia who had been split into three groups. In group A (six patients), individual target doses were predicted from area under the concentration-time curve data after a single 50-mg dose. In group B (five patients), predictions were made as in group A but at steady state. In group C (10 patients), predictions were based on trough clozapine levels obtained at steady state immediately before dose increase. Dosage was increased, if tolerated, by 25 mg twice daily three times a week for 4-8 weeks according to established clinical practice. Clozapine concentrations were measured weekly, and actual target doses were determined for each patient from dose-concentration plots. In groups A and B, the correlation between actual and predicted target dose was not significant (r = 0.18, p = 0.59). In group C, however, it was significant (r = 0.86, p = 0.0016). These results suggest that individualized doses of clozapine for treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia can be conveniently predicted from trough drug levels at the start of therapy.

Previous review articles were scrutinized for additional citations, and manufacturers provided a contemporary bibliography of more recent material.; Studies were selected for specific citation on the basis of comparative research merit and the contribution of this original literature to the pharmacologic profile(s) described.; All SSRIs appear to be more efficacious than placebo for the acute treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Short-term (six-week) efficacy was comparable with that of tricyclic antidepressants for the amelioration of MDD regarded as moderate in severity. Further comparative trials are clearly indicated to demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of SSRIs in specific populations (e.g., geriatric, severely ill) and to demonstrate sustained benefit with long-term prophylaxis. Other potential indications for SSRIs include obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, bulimia, and chronic pain syndromes. Pharmacokinetic profiles of the four SSRIs reveal similar parametric values, and most quantitative differences are of limited clinical significance. Adverse effects are common but ordinarily mild and transient, primarily restricted to the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. Important differences in the prevalence or severity of these adverse effects await the accumulation of further clinical experience and the completion of additional comparative trials. Similarly, the relative propensity of SSRIs to inhibit the metabolism of other medications is currently under investigation.; The four SSRIs studied appear to be more similar than they are different. Slowly, important distinctions are beginning to emerge with regard to adverse effect profiles and potential drug interactions. Given that the costs of these respective medications are comparable, such differences may ultimately serve to establish the preferential selection of individual agents in specific clinical situations.",3,E

Clozapine has been effective and well tolerated in an open trial with 12 adolescents who responded poorly to typical neuroleptics; 16 subjects have been enrolled in a double-blind comparison of haloperidol and clozapine. Longitudinal study of this narrowly defined and possibly more homogeneous group of very early-onset schizophrenia subjects will be relevant to current neurodevelopmental theories addressing the role of puberty, progression of pathology, and continuity or discontinuity with later-onset schizophrenia.",5,E

Separate principal components analyses of the PANSS were done at each time point. PANSS total and component scores were assessed for differences utilizing paired t-tests. Both factor analyses confirmed the five factor model (negative, positive, cognitive, excitement and depression components) explaining 51.7 and 56.2% of the variances at each time point. After medication wash-out psychopathology significantly worsened as measured by total PANSS score and by each of the components. The overall worsening of component scores appeared global and uniform, as evidenced by the fact that at washout, the proportion of individual component scores to total psychopathology remained constant for most components. The lack of change of most components in proportion to the psychopathology total is evidence for the stability of these individual psychopathological dimensions of patients while on and off neuroleptics. The results further support the validity of the five-factor model of schizophrenic psychopathology as measured by the PANSS.",5,E

The 24-h clozapine dose (median with interquartile range in parenthesis) was 350 (228-425) mg/24 h (range 100-700). There was a weak positive correlation between doses and the BPRS total score (r = 0.44, P < 0.05). The median S-Cloza was 1076 (706-1882) nmol/l (range 196-5581 corresponding to 64-1824 ng/ml).

Various strategies have been developed over the past several years to assess and measure more accurately discrete domains of psychopathology. One of the more fruitful strategies to investigate more homogenous domains of psychopathology has been the positive-negative syndrome approach. However, this approach is unable to address a number of important issues. Most schizophrenics present a mixed syndrome; the criteria for what constitutes a positive and negative syndrome are variable; distinguishing primary from secondary negative symptoms can be difficult. In order to address some of these problems, we propose the introduction of a five syndrome model based on a reanalysis of factor analytic procedures used on 240 schizophrenics assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). We present data on a 5-factor solution which appears to best fit the psychopathological data and which is supported by three independent and comparable factor analyses; negative, positive, excitement, cognitive and depression/anxiety domains of psychopathology give patients their individual mark.

It has been suggested that neuroleptic-resistant or neuroleptic-intolerant schizophrenic patients are at higher risk for suicide than neuroleptic-responsive patients. Clozapine is the treatment of choice for neuroleptic-resistant patients, but its use has been greatly limited because of its ability to cause potentially fatal agranulocytosis. The purpose of this study was to compare the suicidality of neuroleptic-resistant and neuroleptic-responsive patients and to determine if clozapine treatment decreased suicidality in the former group.; Prior episodes of suicidality were assessed in a total of 237 neuroleptic-responsive and 184 neuroleptic-resistant patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Eighty-eight of the neuroleptic-resistant patients were treated with clozapine and prospectively evaluated for suicidality for periods of 6 months to 7 years.; There was no significant difference in prior suicidal episodes between neuroleptic-responsive and neuroleptic-resistant patients. Clozapine treatment of the neuroleptic-resistant patients during the follow-up period resulted in markedly less suicidality. The number of suicide attempts with a high-probability of success decreased from five to zero. This decrease in suicidality was associated with improvement in depression and hopelessness.; These results suggest a basis for reevaluation of the risk-benefit assessment of clozapine, i.e., that the overall morbidity and mortality of patients with neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenia are less with clozapine treatment than with typical neuroleptic drugs because of less suicidality. This conclusion also has implications for increasing the use of clozapine with neuroleptic-responsive patients.",I,I

There was no psychotropic or anticholinergic comedication. All patients had normal EEGs before taking clozapine. Fifteen patients showed pathological changes (group 2) and 14 no changes (group 1). Discriminant analysis showed that EEG changes are dependent on plasma levels (P = 0.0009, plasma levels in group 1 mean 81.6 ng/ml, +/- SD 64.6, in group 2 235.7 ng/ml, +/- 169.8). A total of 72.4% of the patients were correctly classified as having either pathological EEG changes or none by this analysis. Variables such as dose, age, sex, weight and duration of treatment were not statistically relevant. It can therefore be suggested that clozapine plasma levels are a valid indicator for the appearance of electrophysiological reactions.",2,E

The authors reviewed the available literature regarding the pharmacologic treatment of schizoaffective disorder. The total number of controlled studies of the acute and prophylactic treatment of schizoaffective disorder was small and few used modern criteria to define the disorder. In studies of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (manic), lithium and antipsychotics produced comparable albeit incomplete responses, except in highly agitated patients when antipsychotics exerted superior efficacy. The combination of lithium and antipsychotics appeared to be superior to antipsychotics alone for schizoaffective, bipolar type patients. In the only controlled study of schizoaffective disorder, depressed type, the presumed superiority of combined antidepressant and antipsychotic treatment to antipsychotic alone was not found. Although combined antipsychotic and thymoleptic treatment represents common prophylactic management of schizoaffective disorder in clinical practice, the efficacy of this strategy has not been studied in controlled trials. Advances in the nosology of schizoaffective disorder, emerging epidemiologic data demonstrating large numbers of patients with this disorder in clinical populations, and preliminary evidence that clozapine may have combined antipsychotic and thymoleptic properties as well as efficacy in both the psychotic and affective components of schizoaffective disorder, suggest that renewed interest in the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder may lead to improved delivery of care for this understudied but seriously ill group of patients.",5,E

Most clinical trials have shown resolution of or improvement in psychotic symptoms accompanying Parkinson's disease without worsening of parkinsonian symptoms. Adverse effects appear to be mild at dosages of < 100 mg/day; sedation is the most frequent problem. Most of these studies have serious limitations, however; until better studies have been completed, the decision to use clozapine for Parkinson's disease-related psychosis should be made on a case-by-case basis, with thorough evaluation of risks, benefits, and other therapeutic options. Some patients with Parkinson's disease have shown improvement in tremor and other abnormal movements when given clozapine. Clozapine cannot be recommended for treating tardive dyskinesia on the basis of the research done so far; some trials show dramatic resolution of symptoms, others no benefit. Anticholinergics or dopamine-reuptake inhibitors should be considered before clozapine is given to patients with tardive dyskinesia because of clozapine's potential for serious adverse effects. A few patients with Huntington's disease have responded to clozapine, but again no conclusions can be drawn. Clozapine appears to offer no real advantage over haloperidol for treating choreiform movements in Huntington's disease. The frequency of tics in Tourette's syndrome does not seem to be reduced by clozapine. Clozapine has shown some efficacy as a treatment for psychosis and abnormal movements in Parkinson's disease. Results have been less promising for other movement disorders. Further study in larger populations is needed before any definitive conclusions about clozapine's place in movement disorder therapy can be made.",5,E

The observation that, in vitro, clozapine binds the protein products of different DRD4 alleles with differing affinity characteristics suggested this hypothesis.; The region of the DRD4 gene that encodes the putative third cytoplasmic loop of the D4 receptor contains a 48-base pair sequence repeated a variable number of times. With use of polymerase chain reaction amplification, we assessed this variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism in a series of schizophrenic and schizoaffective subjects who had been treated with clozapine, and related genotype with treatment response, to test the hypothesis that DRD4 alleles lead to varying response to clozapine.; Allelic variation at the DRD4 locus does not predict clinical response to clozapine relative to either fluphenazine hydrochloride or placebo in subjects with treatment-refractory schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.; DRD4 alleles do not predict therapeutic response to clozapine in schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients. There are implications from these data for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the mechanism of clozapine's therapeutic effect are discussed.",2,E

We present data in support of the clinical impression using both an animal model of the disorder and dyskinetic patients themselves. Clozapine produces a lower rate of oral dyskinesia in laboratory rats after 6 months of chronic treatment than does haloperidol (8.6 +/- 1.3 vs. 13.6 +/- 1.4 vacuous chewing movements every 5 minutes, respectively), suggesting a lower propensity to cause tardive dyskinesia. In the human, when clozapine was compared with haloperidol in the treatment of patients with tardive dyskinesia, clozapine produced significantly greater benefit for motor symptoms after 12 months of treatment than did haloperidol (p < .001). Moreover, the dyskinesia rebound, which occurred equally in both drug groups at the beginning of the study, was sustained in the haloperidol group but lost in the clozapine-treated patients. These data suggest that dyskinetic patients lose their symptoms of tardive dyskinesia, along with dopaminergic hypersensitivity, with long-term clozapine treatment.",5,E

In a previous study, we found that plasma drug concentrations above 350 ng/mL maximized clinical response in a group of 29 patients. This study represents a follow-up of these original 29 patients over approximately 2 1/2 years of clozapine treatment. We found that during the initial 6-week trial of clozapine, 38% (N = 11) of the patients were considered to be responders. With continued treatment, we found that 58% (14 of 24) were classified as responders. Consistent with our previous study, we observed that plasma concentrations were helpful in predicting response. Five of 7 patients who had unsatisfactory response became responders when their plasma clozapine concentrations increased to above 350 ng/mL. We conclude that the assessment of plasma clozapine concentrations as a guide to dose adjustment may be useful in maximizing response.",5,E

Currently, there is an intensive investigational effort attempting to delineate which of clozapine's many biochemical effects are important for its impressive clinical profile. In this paper, the effects of clozapine on noradrenergic function are examined. Preclinical and clinical studies indicate that clozapine selectively increases noradrenergic activity and norepinephrine outflow. Moreover, data are presented demonstrating that clozapine causes fivefold increases in plasma norepinephrine in schizophrenic patients and that these increases are related to its superior clinical efficacy. A novel hypothesis for its superior efficacy is proposed that involves complex actions on noradrenergic systems that result in robust norepinephrine outflow. Implications of heightened norepinephrine outflow are discussed.",2,E

Toxicity was produced by an immunoglobulin fraction, predominantly of the IgM class. The offending drug was not necessary at this stage to produce cytotoxicity. These effects were observed by inhibiting post-phagocytosis glycolysis, by ejection of trypan blue, or by enhanced release of 51Cr from lysed-labeled PMNs. Direct chemical toxicity, produced by clozapine or its metabolites, was tested by similar procedures. At a concentration of 10(-5) M in a colloidal milieu produced by dilution with AB serum, no cytotoxicity was observed; however, in aqueous medium. N-desmethylclozapine was toxic to PMNs and proliferating lymphocytes. Post-recovery serum appeared to be inert, but cytotoxicity was restored by adding clozapine or N-desmethylclozapine to the sensitive patient's serum. At this stage, cytotoxicity as measured by 51Cr release was abrogated by anti-IgG or anti-IgM. These relationships favor an immunologic mechanism that damages peripheral PMNs. Development of colony-forming units-granulocyte (CFU-G) was similarly inhibited in normal marrow cultures by cytotoxic serum alone, whereas no metabolite had such an effect at the same concentration (10(-5) M).",6,E

Clozapine was titrated over an average of 3 to 5 weeks up to a dose of 500 to 600 mg/day. Psychopathology was assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions scale.; A clinically significant weight gain occurred mostly during the first 6 to 12 months, but continued well into the third year of treatment. Weight gain and treatment response were not correlated, and early weight gain was not a predictor of response. The cumulative incidence of patients becoming substantially overweight exceeded 50%. Being underweight at baseline correlated with maximum amount gained (p = .000), and being overweight at baseline correlated with percentage above ideal weight (p = .006).; Treatment with clozapine is associated with a high incidence of substantial weight gain, posing a potential long-term health risk.

Relative metabolic rates were increased in the basal ganglia, especially on the right side. In the frontal lobe, metabolic rates were lowered, more on the left than on the right. The anterior nuclei of the thalamus also showed lower metabolic rates after clozapine. We have previously observed patients with schizophrenia to have low metabolic rates in the basal ganglia and to lack the normal right > left asymmetry; in this study, clozapine normalized striatal activity. In the frontal lobe, asymmetry was normalized, but hypofrontal function was, if anything, exaggerated. This effect in the frontal lobe was not observed with haloperidol in earlier studies. The cortical effects of clozapine may be related to its unique clinical properties and suggest important differences between typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs.",2,E

Chronic treatment with typical neuroleptics has been reported to produce only minimal improvement in and may impair cognitive function in schizophrenia. We have studied the effect of clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, on cognitive function in 36 patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. In addition, patients with non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia were randomly assigned to clozapine (N = 24) or typical neuroleptics (N = 23). Cognitive function in the treatment-resistant schizophrenia group was studied after 6 weeks and 6 months of treatment, while the non-treatment-resistant patients were also studied at 12 months of treatment. Clozapine treatment improved several domains of cognitive function, especially attention and verbal fluency in both treatment-resistant schizophrenia and non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia. On the other hand, typical neuroleptic treatment produced minimal improvement in cognitive function. The effect of clozapine on some tests of attention and verbal fluency was significantly greater than that of typical neuroleptic treatment in non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia. These data suggest that clozapine treatment was superior to typical neuroleptics in improving cognitive function in schizophrenia. The possibility that this is related to normalization of dopaminergic function by clozapine is discussed.",I,5

Sensory dominance was studied via simple and choice RTs to lights and tones, and on double-stimulus trials in which the two stimuli were presented simultaneously. Although 8 of the 25 patients could not perform the RT tasks when taking placebo, there were no effects of clozapine on simple or choice RT compared to placebo or fluphenazine. Subjects on all 3 treatments showed visual dominance: faster RT to lights than to tones on choice and double-stimulus trials. However, clozapine reduced this by means of a selective increase in RT to lights. Clozapine reduced failures to respond to the tone on double-stimulus trials. This was shown to be due to reductions in hallucinations. Clozapine does not generally improve attention, but it may increase the ability of schizophrenic persons to process nondominant or unattended stimuli possibly by increasing the efficiency of resource allocation. This may be partially mediated by a reduction in hallucinations.",I,6

The study patients (n = 268) and the comparison patients (n = 1959) were permanently disabled, noninstitutionalized patients with schizophrenia, 19 through 60 years of age, who were insured by Medicaid. We conducted interrupted time-series regression analyses to estimate the effects of the cap on the use of medications and mental health services.; The cap resulted in immediate reductions (range, 15 to 49 percent) in the use of antipsychotic drugs, antidepressants and lithium, and anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs (P < 0.01). It also resulted in coincident increases of one to two visits per patient per month in visits to CMHCs (range of increase, 43 to 57 percent; P < 0.001) and sharp increases in the use of emergency mental health services and partial hospitalization (1.2 to 1.4 episodes per patient per month), but no change in the frequency of hospital admissions. After the cap was discontinued, the use of medications and most mental health services reverted to base-line levels (measured in the first 14 months of the study). The estimated average increase in mental health care costs per patient during the cap ($1,530) exceeded the savings in drug costs to Medicaid by a factor of 17.; Limits on coverage for the costs of prescription drugs can increase the use of acute mental health services among low-income patients with chronic mental illnesses and increase costs to the government, even aside from the increases caused in pain and suffering on the part of patients.",5,E

For some patients, data on relapse and hospitalization during treatment were compared with data from the year before treatment.; Eighteen of the 30 patients met criteria for sustained response; 17 of the responders were identified within the first four months of treatment. Patients experienced significantly fewer relapses and hospitalizations during treatment than in the previous year. Improvement in positive symptoms, general symptomatology, and levels of functioning reached a plateau during the first six months of treatment and remained at that level during the second six months. Negative symptoms and quality of life showed nonsignificant improvements at 12 months.; Results support the use of clozapine in treating chronic, residually symptomatic schizophrenic outpatients. A four-month clozapine trial may be adequate to detect clinical responders in this population.",I,2

Neurochemical characteristics that distinguish clozapine from other neuroleptics and contribute to its differential efficacy are not known. We assessed the effects of clozapine on plasma levels of norepinephrine (NE) in a double-blind, parallel groups comparison of clozapine (n = 11) and haloperidol (n = 15) in chronic schizophrenic outpatients who had been previously treated with fluphenazine. Simultaneous measurements were obtained for plasma levels of the catecholamine precursor dopa, the dopamine metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), the NE metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), cortisol, and hemodynamic parameters. Clozapine produced marked increases (471%) in plasma NE levels, whereas haloperidol had no significant effects on plasma NE levels. Clozapine also increased dopa and tended to increase DOPAC levels, without effects on DHPG, ACTH, or cortisol levels and without consistent changes in blood pressure. Across patients, the magnitude of clozapine-induced increments in plasma NE levels was positively related to improvement in positive symptoms and global symptomatology and was unrelated to the occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms. The results suggest that clozapine differs importantly from other neuroleptics in increasing plasma NE levels, with the peripheral noradrenergic stimulation related to its superior efficacy profile. The unchanged DHPG levels and absence of hypertension suggest a more complex mechanism of action of clozapine than heightened NE release alone.",6,E

The protocol called for the treating psychiatrist to provide symptom- and adverse-effect ratings at four times following the start of drug therapy. The outcome criteria included the Sandoz study outcome measure of symptom improvement as well as discharge status for one year of follow-up. To assess the validity of the ratings, several measures of internal consistency were determined. Clozapine therapy was started in 227 patients, and symptom data are available for 202.; Overall, 33 percent (n = 66) of the patients were improved at the end of one year of treatment; 12 percent (n = 24) maintained symptom improvement at all three evaluation times. Modest, statistically significant improvement after 12 weeks compared with baseline Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total scores was observed for the patients continuing medication (n = 152); the emergence of a previously unimproved group (n = 26) explains this modest improvement. However, in the analysis of all patients (n = 202), (including dropouts), there was no significant symptom improvement after 12 weeks. Lower baseline BPRS scores predicted significant symptom improvement after 12 weeks of treatment. Among those medicated for one year, the pattern of symptom improvement showed that the probability of late improvement was 0.26 for those previously unimproved, and the probability of a 12-week responder losing improvement was 0.23, resulting in a net group gain of 3 cases in 100. By the end of one year, 8 percent (n = 17) of the cohort was discharged, and 3 percent (n = 7) was transferred to another facility while continuing to receive clozapine. Of the 227 original patients started on clozapine therapy, medication was discontinued for adverse effects in 11 percent (n = 25): white blood cell count (WBC) decrease (but no agranulocytosis) in 5 percent (n = 12), seizures in 1 percent (n = 3), one patient with seizures and decreased WBC count, and other events (e.g., cardiovascular changes, fever, or possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome) in 4 percent (n = 9). Patient refusal was reported for 6 percent (n = 13) of those starting treatment.; Although only 19 percent of the patients exhibited improvement at 6 weeks, the response rate at 12 weeks (29 percent) for this naturalistic study cohort was similar to that in the major, double-blind, six-week, controlled, clinical trial of clozapine. The impersistence of response as symptoms were followed for up to one year is a finding that deserves rigorous evaluation.",4,E

Fifteen DSM-III schizophrenic patients were abruptly withdrawn in a double-blind fashion from stable haloperidol treatment. Weekly ratings of dyskinesia and psychopathology were performed for 4 weeks post-withdrawal. There was an overall increase in dyskinesia ratings over the 4-week period (p < 0.05) beginning in week 2, with dyskinetic movements of the fingers showing the most significant increase (p < 0.001). There were no overall changes in psychopathology, though the group appeared to be bimodal with 6 of the 15 patients showing a significant relapse in psychotic symptoms. Neither baseline TD nor psychotic relapse significantly interacted with change in TD over time. These schizophrenic patients showed an increase in global dyskinesia rating early within four weeks of neuroleptic withdrawal. This time course did not appear to be associated with reemergence of psychopathology which occurred later. A significant minority of patients relapsed within this time period. This suggests the relative safety of brief periods of neuroleptic withdrawal for carefully selected patients in a controlled setting with specific goals (e.g., for evaluation or in preparation for clozapine) and the need to further understand who is at risk for rapid relapse.",3,E

The previously treated but not the neuroleptic-naive patients also showed a significant reduction in negative symptoms (19% from baseline). A longer duration of illness before baseline assessment and inconsistent treatment during follow-up were independently associated with poorer treatment outcome in terms of positive symptoms in both groups.

Of the patients who began a clozapine trial, 76 percent were still taking the drug 12 months later. Preliminary findings from a randomized trial of clozapine versus usual care (n = 227) indicate that discharge rates associated with clozapine and usual care do not differ. Once discharged, however, patients assigned to clozapine are less likely to be readmitted. Hence, clozapine may be more cost-effective than usual care.

In early phase II trials, the antipsychotic was well tolerated and results suggested efficacy in the treatment of the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The efficacy and safety of ICI 204,636 were evaluated on a larger scale in a 6-week, multicenter, double-blind trial. Hospitalized patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for chronic or subchronic schizophrenia with acute exacerbation, as well as other criteria, were randomized to ICI 204,636 (75 to 750 mg daily) (N = 54) or placebo (N = 55). Patients were assessed weekly by use of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), and Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) for efficacy and the Simpson Scale and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale for extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Significant differences (p < or = 0.05) between treatment groups, which favored ICI 204,636, were identified throughout the trial. Endpoint differences were significant (by analysis of covariance) for BPRS factor IV (activation) and SANS scores and were marginally significant for total BPRS, BPRS factor III (thought disturbance), BPRS positive-symptom cluster, and CGI Severity of Illness item scores (p = 0.07, 0.09, 0.06, and 0.09, respectively). ICI 204,636 was well tolerated, although it was associated with mild transient increases in alanine aminotransferase and a higher incidence of somnolence and anticholinergic effects compared with placebo. In the dose range studied, treatment with ICI 204,636 did not induce EPS as determined by analysis of Simpson Scale total scores and lack of treatment-emergent acute dystonic reactions. Furthermore, ICI 204,636 did not produce sustained levels of prolactin; the mean change from baseline at endpoint (-7.2 micrograms/L) was comparable (p = 0.44) to that for placebo (-8.2 micrograms/L). These findings distinguish ICI 204,636 from standard antipsychotics and confirm preclinical predictions that ICI 204,636 is an atypical antipsychotic.",I,4

We explored the use of SPEM as an outcome measure in an open-label clinical trial of famotidine, an H-2 antagonist, in patients with schizophrenia; famotidine has been proposed as an adjunctive medication, particularly for negative symptoms. Prior studies using SPEM as an outcome measure have not found a significant effect with ""typical"" neuroleptic medication, and one study found greater SPEM dysfunction with clozapine treatment. In this study, 19 schizophrenic subjects were stabilized for at least 1 week on conventional neuroleptic medications and then administered oral famotidine, 100 mg daily, for an additional 3 weeks. SPEM and clinical measures were assessed. Whereas Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Schedule for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) scores decreased significantly with famotidine administration, there was no significant change in SPEM performance over the course of the study. Two subjects (11%) doubled their signal/noise ratio and maintained this increase after famotidine discontinuation, whereas three subjects (17%) approximately halved this ratio and returned to baseline after famotidine discontinuation. SPEM changes were not found to correlate significantly with changes in BPRS or SANS scores. These findings suggest that SPEM dysfunction reflects a ""trait"" rather than clinical ""state"" in schizophrenia, and changes in SPEM performance might not be expected always to parallel changes in clinical ratings.",5,E

Symptom improvement significantly correlated with idazoxan-induced changes in indices of noradrenergic function. In a subgroup of patients, idazoxan plus typical neuroleptic treatment compared favourably with clozapine treatment, when both were compared to typical neuroleptic treatment alone.; The antagonism of alpha 2 receptors augmented therapeutic response to typical neuroleptic treatment in treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia.

8736614,Adverse effects of antipsychotic agents. Do newer agents offer advantages?,Antipsychotic Agents; Humans; Schizophrenia,"Owens, D G","Although antipsychotic drugs are effective in treating the so-called positive features of schizophrenia, between one-quarter and one-third of patients respond poorly. Furthermore, the incidence of adverse effects is high, especially those reflecting disruption of extrapyramidal function, and is a major source of non-compliance. There is a clear need for new compounds that are more efficacious and/or better tolerated. Until recently, the classical dopamine hypothesis, with its emphasis on D2 blockade as the key mechanism of antipsychotic action, dominated drug development, though the emphasis is now shifting. Three 'new' antipsychotics have reached the international market in the past 5 years-the newly rehabilitated clozapine and the genuinely new remoxipride and risperidone. Claims of enhanced tolerability have been made for each of these, but as none is free from adverse effects, their place in treatment can only be meaningfully established in relation to the efficacy of each in different clinical situations. Clozapine has an extensive profile of general, nonhaematological adverse effects which is slightly different in emphasis from, but comparable in incidence to, that of chlorpromazine. There is a 0.8% risk of agranulocytosis in the first year of exposure, which can be fatal, though the boundary separating it from other (especially phenothiazine) antipsychotics in this regard is becoming increasingly blurred. It has a clearly diminished liability to cause extrapyramidal adverse effects. Its proven efficacy in operationally defined treatment-resistant schizophrenia and in patients intolerant to the extrapyramidal adverse effects of standard drugs establishes its credentials for advantage in these groups. There is on present evidence, however, only a hint of enhanced efficacy in acute schizophrenia: this requires further investigation. Open maintenance studies provide impressive data on long term outcome, especially in terms of quality-of-life parameters, but this issue requires to be addressed in blind, randomised trials. Until such additional information is forthcoming the risks and consequent costs would not justify extension of its use. The evidence to date is that reported benefits in so-called negative features probably reflect its favourable neurological profile. While the advantages of clozapine are undoubted, they remain as yet restricted to selected patient groups. Remoxipride has a good general tolerability profile, its special strength being its low sedative effect. However, its reported association with aplastic anaemia has severely restricted its use, and regular haematological monitoring is required. Although remoxipride appears to have a lower liability to produce extrapyramidal adverse effects than the high potency haloperidol, its benefits relative to other low potency compounds in this regard remain unproven. The only obvious situation in which its risks and consequent costs would be justified would seem to be patients with established compliance problems as a result of intrusive sedation with standard drugs. The position of other benzamides such as raclopride and amisulpride remains to be established. Risperidone, perhaps from its antiadrenergic actions, has more in the way of cardiovascular adverse effects than haloperidol, though these can be obviated by graded early exposure. It may also be associated with greater weight gain. Otherwise it appears to be well tolerated. In comparison with haloperidol, it appears to be associated with a lower prevalence of acute extrapyramidal adverse effects in dosages < or = 10 mg/day, the most potentially important component of which is its reportedly insignificant likelihood of promoting akathisia. These conclusions emerge from comparisons with haloperidol in doses many might consider somewhat high. The question of the advantage of risperidone over low or milligram-equivalent haloperidol regimens remains open.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",5,E

Ninety percent of subjects who had one or more 5-HT2Cser alleles (19/21) were classified as clozapine responders compared with 59% (84/141) without this allele (chi 2 = 7.7, p = 0.005), suggesting that this mutation is a predictor of good response to clozapine. There was no association between schizophrenia and the 5-HT2Cser allele, but our results indicate that the 5-HT2C receptor may contain the major site of action through which clozapine mediates its antipsychotic effects.",5,E

Clinical trials in chronic schizophrenic patients have shown trends in favor of risperidone in the control of negative symptoms compared with haloperidol, perphenazine or zuclopenthixol, but the differences were not consistently statistically significant. A meta-analysis of the pooled results from six double-blind trials showed that risperidone at doses ranging from 4 to 8 mg/day had a significantly (p < 0.004) higher negative symptom response rate, defined as the percentage of patients with a 20% or more reduction in scores on the negative subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, than patients receiving active controls.

Studies consistently support its efficacy for reducing positive symptoms in acutely psychotic patients and in treatment-resistant patients, for preventing positive symptom exacerbations as a maintenance treatment, and for reducing symptoms of hostility and violence. There is evidence to suggest that clozapine may improve social and occupational functioning and quality of life and may reduce affective symptoms, hospitalizations, secondary negative symptoms, and tardive dyskinesia. Its most significant side effects include agranulocytosis, seizures, weight gain, hypotension and tachycardia, sedation, and perhaps rebound psychosis (with abrupt discontinuation of medication).",5,E

The Child Behavior Rating Form (CBRF) was modified by altering instructions and adding new items describing behavior problems known to occur in children with mental retardation. The adapted scale was named the Nisonger CBRF. Three hundred sixty-nine children being assessed at a University Affiliated Program for MR/DD were rated on the CBRF by their parents and teachers. Independent factor analyses of parent and teacher ratings produced two Social Competence subscales and six Problem Behavior subscales. These results were largely consistent across rater types and similar to prior findings with the CBRF. Internal consistency was generally high, parent-teacher agreement was satisfactory, and subscales from the Nisonger CBRF correlated highly with analogous subscales from the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. The Nisonger CBRF appears to be a promising new tool for assessing behavioral and emotional problems in children with mental retardation; however, further psychometric work is warranted.",E,E

The MR spectra of 8 cm3 voxels were compared with clinical assessment of BPRS in each subject.; No significant metabolic lateral effect was established in both schizophrenia and control groups (P > 0.05). After neuroleptic treatment, chronic schizophrenic patients generally demonstrated a decrease of the complex of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (Glu) containing (GABA + Glu)/creatine (Cr) ratio.; The current follow-up 1H MR spectroscopy study shows a significant correlation between alterations of (GABA + Glu)/Cr ratio and BPRS, and supports a hypofrontality hypothesis in chronic schizophrenia. The reduction of (GABA + Glu)/Cr ratio after neuroleptic treatment may implicate the recovery of normal neuronal function in neurotransmitters. In vivo 1H MR spectroscopy may be a useful modality in follow-up evaluation of neuroleptic treatment in chronic schizophrenia.",6,E

In a preliminary study to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of this drug, we conducted a survey of resperidone utilization, cost, and safety during its first year of availability at an academic psychiatric hospital. Data were obtained from a computerized, centralized medical record system, from an adverse drug reaction monitoring system, and from pharmacy purchasing records. In its first year of availability, risperidone became the second most widely used antipsychotic agent at our institution. Most of this use extended beyond the adult schizophrenia population, for whom pre-marketing safety and efficacy data are available. The direct institutional cost of risperidone treatment exceeded the entire budget for antipsychotic drugs during the year before its release. Results from the adverse drug reaction reporting system did not indicate a strong advantage of risperidone over more established antipsychotic agents with respect to extrapyramidal side effects. Furthermore, the mean dose of risperidone associated with extrapyramidal symptoms was 3.5 mg/day, considerably lower than that suggested by pre-marketing studies in a more select patient group. These results confirm that new pharmacological agents are generally used in much broader patient populations than those for which efficacy and safety have been established prior to FDA approval. This study also raises questions about the therapeutic efficiency of risperidone compared with other antipsychotic drugs.

We support this contention with a discussion of recent findings from post-marketing pharmacoepidemiologic and pharmacoeconomic investigations of clozapine. The pharmacoeconomic evaluations purport to show cost savings of clozapine versus standard neuroleptic therapy but these conclusions are flawed, in large part because the epidemiologic investigations on which they are based are inadequate. To correct this situation, long-term, randomized field trials (usual practice settings) are needed to compare costs and outcomes of clozapine versus standard therapy. The design of these studies should incorporate multidimensional outcomes, including social function, employment, and rehospitalization, as well as measures of symptoms and self-reported quality of life. Pharmacoeconomic evaluations that adopt the designs of typical clinical trials with limited outcome measures, such as symptoms or self-reported quality of life measures, will not be sufficient to determine cost-effectiveness for psychopharmacologic therapies of severe mental disorders.",5,E

Because these side effects can cause noncompliance with antipsychotic medication and consequent relapse, they add to the morbidity of schizophrenia. A compound with antipsychotic efficacy but without the side effects of standard antipsychotic agents would improve compliance and treatment outcomes and enhance quality of life. Improved compliance, reduced relapse, and decreased hospitalization would also reduce the cost of treatment of schizophrenia. Seroquel (ICI 204,636), an atypical antipsychotic compound in Phase III development, was found to be well tolerated and effective in treating subjects with DSM-III-R schizophrenia in three Phase II clinical trials. Analysis of plasma prolactin concentrations obtained during these trials revealed that ICI 204,636 did not differ from placebo in its effect on plasma prolactin after up to 6 weeks of treatment; no significant difference was found in the degree of decline of plasma prolactin levels when subjects treated with ICI 204,636 and placebo were compared. A significant difference was found, however, between ICI 204,636- and chlorpromazine-treated subjects; prolactin levels in ICI 204,636-treated subjects fell to a greater degree than they did in chlorpromazine-treated subjects, however in all three trials, ICI 204,636 did not cause sustained elevation of prolactin.",5,E

At baseline, 8 subjects had mild or moderate obsessions, and 6 had mild compulsions. There was no significant difference in the course of obsessive-compulsive symptoms among the three treatment groups. We found that olanzapine did not appear to cause obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Our sample size, the dose and duration of olanzapine treatment, and assessment methods limit the extent to which this finding can be generalized.

Melperone is an atypical antipsychotic drug showing in vivo a greater relative affinity for the 5-HT2 than the D2 receptors. A two-year study to assess the clinical efficacy and the safety of melperone in the management of iatrogenic psychosis in 30 parkinsonian patients was carried out. Neurological evaluation was performed with patients in the ""off"" and in the ""on"" state using the motor examination of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).

Patients were recruited from a prospective, double blind controlled trial of olanzapine versus haloperidol treatment. In vivo striatal D2 binding data from olanzapine treated patients (n = 6) were compared with previously reported data from typical antipsychotic responsive (n = 10); clozapine (n = 10); and risperidone (n = 6) treated patient groups. Mean % Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score (BPRS) improvement following olanzapine treatment was 49% (SD 44).

In overall symptomatology improvement [BPRS-total score and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)-total score], Olz10.0 was statistically significantly superior to placebo. In positive symptom improvement (PANSS-positive score, BPRS-positive score), Olz10.0 was statistically significantly superior to placebo. In negative symptom improvement (PANSS-negative score), Olz10.0 was statistically superior to placebo. Olz 1.0 was clinically comparable to placebo in all efficacy comparisons. The only adverse event to show an overall statistically significant incidence difference was anorexia (reported for 10% of placebo-treated and 0% of Olz10.0-treated patients). The Olz10.0-treated patients improved over baseline with respect to parkinsonian and akathisia symptoms, and these changes were comparable with those observed with placebo. There were no dystonias associated with Olz10.0 treatment. At endpoint, the incidence of patients with elevated prolactin values did not differ statistically significantly between placebo-treated and Olz10.0-treated patients.

Nineteen neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenic patients who received clozapine were withdrawn from clozapine by tapering it over 3-week period with and without the addition of a typical neuroleptic. Fifteen of the 19 neuroleptic-responsive patients experienced the return of psychotic symptoms during or after the clozapine taper, which were most severe in the ten patients in whom the withdrawal of clozapine was carried out without prior addition of neuroleptic treatment. Addition of a neuroleptic prior to clozapine withdrawal prevented the emergence of positive symptoms during clozapine withdrawal in each of eight patients. Nevertheless, psychotic symptoms emerged, usually within a week after discontinuing clozapine, in six of the eight patients. Neuroleptic treatment, with or without an anticholingergic drug, was much less effective in treating positive symptoms in these patients immediately after the clozapine withdrawal than it had been 2 years previously. Cyproheptadine, a non-selective serotonin receptor antagonist, augmented the antipsychotic effect of neuroleptics in each of four patients who relapsed following withdrawal from clozapine and relieved extrapyramidal symptoms in a fifth patient. The frequency of relapse following withdrawal of clozapine in 64 neuroleptic-resistant patients was significantly lower (25/64, 39.1%) than in the neuroleptic-responsive patients.",6,E

Cholinergic rebound is a likely explanation for the mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms and is easily treated with an anticholinergic agent. Mesolimbic supersensitivity, as well as specific properties of clozapine, are discussed as likely causes for rapidonset psychosis. Our findings are consistent with previous reports of withdrawal reactions associated with clozapine, further reminding clinicians to monitor patients closely following abrupt discontinuation of clozapine.",5,E

Baseline clinical assessments were completed before the patients' regular antipsychotic and anticholinergic drugs were discontinued. During clozapine treatment, serum levels were ascertained weekly to allow adjustment of clozapine doses so as to maintain each patient near the midpoint of his or her assigned serum level range.

Safety assessments included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Ratinf Scale (ESRS) UKU Side Effect Rating Scale, vital signs, body weight, ECG and laboratory screening.; Risperidone had a bell-shaped dose-response curve, with optimal therapeutic responses occurring at a daily dose of 8 mg. The therapeutic response to haloperidol was similar to that seen with risperidone 16 mg. Risperidone was associated with significantly less extrapyramidal symptoms than haloperidol, as assessed by the ESRS. The effect was mirrored by the requirement for antiparkinson rescue medication. Furthermore, the overall incidence of adverse events was markedly lower with the optimum dose of risperidone than with haloperidol.; Risperidone is at least as effective as haloperidol for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia.

Unfortunately, monotherapy with each of these conventional agents often fails. To improve outcome, clinicians utilize polypharmacy. Although the efficacy of this practice is largely unknown, because of the lack of controlled studies, data from the United States and Europe indicate polypharmacy is the rule rather than the exception. The few controlled trials that have been conducted indicate that (1) the specific combination of lithium plus imipramine provides no advantage over lithium monotherapy (notwithstanding the inadequacy of lithium monotherapy); (2) the specific combination of lithium and the depot neuroleptic flupenthixol provides no advantage over lithium monotherapy; and (3) the combination of lithium plus carbamazepine may be as effective as lithium plus haloperidol for acute and continuation treatment. Most of the literature on polypharmacy consists of case reports, retrospective chart reviews, and open-label prospective studies, and describes the use of numerous combinations of medications, including lithium plus valproate, lithium plus carbamazepine, and valproate plus carbamazepine. Preliminary findings suggest these combinations may be effective, and that clozapine and high-dose levothyroxine may each be useful as well when combined with other drugs. Further research is necessary to formally evaluate whether these drug combinations are more effective than monotherapy. Until such studies are completed, certain general principles regarding side effects, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics should be kept in mind when prescribing two or more medications concurrently.",5,E

Long-term patients in Connecticut's state hospitals who met Food and Drug Administration criteria for clozapine use were invited to participate in this randomized open-label study. Participants (N = 227) were followed for 2 years. Compared with usual care, clozapine was associated with significantly greater reductions in side effects, disruptiveness, and hospitalization, but was not more effective in reducing symptoms or improving quality of life. The groups did not differ in likelihood of being discharged; however, once discharged, clozapine patients were less likely to be readmitted. The results of our study suggest that, compared with the flexible range of medication alternatives available, clozapine is an effective agent. However, at least with this patient population, clozapine did not produce the dramatic improvements is symptomatology or hospital utilization reported in clinical efficacy trials or suggested by mirror-image studies.",I,4

Longitudinal analysis of 45 patients revealed 20 with baseline DE, 7 who developed emergent DE after a negative baseline assessment, and 18 patients with no DE symptoms throughout treatment with clozapine. Eight of the 20 patients with baseline DE were assessed to resolution of symptoms, with an average time of 261 +/- 188 days; 5 were evaluated until complete resolution of symptoms (AIMS = 0), with an average time of 691 +/- 462 days. The average time to onset of DE in emergent DE patients was 238 +/- 179 days, and the average time to resolution was 347 +/- 179 days after diagnosis. Four patients attained complete resolution with an average time of 629 +/- 293 days after diagnosis. It appears this emergent type of dyskinesia is different from other currently described dyskinesias. Overall, of the 27 patients having DE at any point in treatment, 15 of 27 (56%) had resolution of symptoms and 10 of 27 (37%) had complete resolution of DE. Clinicians should be aware of the utility of clozapine in dyskinesia and the extended time frame of response.",I,2

Based on the changes in their CGI scores at week 16 of clozapine treatment, subjects were retrospectively categorized as ""improvers"" (N = 12) and ""nonimprovers"" (N = 18). The two groups were compared for changes in total BPRS and BPRS factor scores. In terms of total BPRS scores, we expected a difference between the two groups because they were categorized based on changes in their CGI scores. However, the total BPRS scores in improvers showed a significant decrease by week 6 of clozapine treatment. On analyzing the four BPRS factors, the improvers showed improvement in the thinking disturbance factor by week 1 that remained steady from week 7. On the hostility-suspiciousness factor, the improvers showed an improvement across time when compared with nonimprovers. The withdrawal-retardation factor showed improvement in both groups across time, whereas the anxiety-depression factor was least influenced by clozapine. These observations suggested that all BPRS symptom factors did not uniformly contribute to improvement in overall psychopathology, which was observed as a decrease in total BPRS scores.",6,E

Information related to clozapine eligibility was abstracted by trained non-clinical personnel. The impact of subgroup membership on eligibility was examined using logistic regression procedures. 3. Even under the broadest interpretation of FDA requirements for clozapine use, Asian patients were less likely to be eligible, since fewer Asian patients met clozapine treatment requirements. Under more stringent eligibility criteria, older patients were more likely to be excluded from eligibility when TD does not automatically satisfy treatment criteria, and younger patients were more likely to lose eligibility if the number of required adequate medication trials increases to three. 4. Broad eligibility criteria tend to differentially exclude Asian patients while more stringent criteria differentially exclude younger and older patients.",5,E

Rates of eosinophilia and neutropenia were compared between the two treatment groups.; Treatment-emergent eosinophilia occurred frequently in both haloperidol- and clozapine-treated patients. No significant difference was seen between groups in the incidence of eosinophilia and neutropenia.; We find no statistical difference between the rates of eosinophilia or neutropenia in haloperidol- and clozapine-treated patients.

The studies of relationships between blood levels of reduced haloperidol HL (RH) and clinical efficacy in haloperidol (HL)-treated patients have yielded variable results. On the other hand, the contribution of RH upon HL's extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) had been suggested in animal models as well as in preliminary clinical studies with limited subjects. 2. This study explored the relationships between blood drug levels and clinical effects and EPS of HL in 48 Chinese acutely exacerbated schizophrenic inpatients. After a single-blind placebo period of one week, the patients were treated with a fixed dose 10 mg of HL for two weeks. Steady-state levels of HL and RH in plasma (n = 48) and in red blood cells (RBC) (n = 37) were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. 3. The mean RH/HL ratio in RBC in the Chinese (0.55) is lower than that in non-Chinese patients as reported in the literature (> 2), so is the RH/HL ratios in plasma. 4. No significant relationship emerged between percent improvement in BPRS total score and any of drug indices (HL, RH, sum of two compounds (HL+RH), and RH/HL ratio) in plasma and in RBC. Furthermore, the responders did not differ significantly from the nonresponders in each drug index. 5.

Results showed no difference between decisions regarding treatment by the ART network and by the experts. Length of hospital stay was also similar. All ART suggestions included supportive psychotherapy. High potency antipsychotics were suggested for 7 schizophrenic inpatients, clozapine for one and the addition of community therapy for another. Depressed patients got a variety of treatment suggestions. No contraindicated treatment was suggested by ART; however, two incomplete treatment suggestions were dropped from the study. In conclusion, in a prospective study ART was successful in learning treatment strategies and performed under supervision similar to experts.",5,E

The primary efficacy analysis involved the mean change from baseline to endpoint in total scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Secondary analyses included comparisons of the mean change in positive and negative symptoms, comorbid depression, extrapyramidal symptoms, and overall drug safety.; Olanzapine demonstrated clinical results superior to those of haloperidol on overall improvement according to the BPRS and on every secondary measure, including depression. Olanzapine was also associated with significantly fewer discontinuations of treatment due to lack of drug efficacy or adverse events. Substantially more olanzapine-treated patients (66.5%) than haloperidol-treated patients (46.8%) completed 6 weeks of therapy. Statistically significant advantages of olanzapine treatment were related to 1) change in negative symptoms, 2) extrapyramidal symptom profile, 3) effect on prolactin levels, and 4) response rate.; Olanzapine shows a superior and broader spectrum of efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenic psychopathology, with a substantially more favorable safety profile, than haloperidol.

Changes in the treatment groups from baseline to endpoint in summary scores on the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and several secondary measures were compared. This article describes a path analysis to determine to what extent the total treatment effect on negative symptoms was direct or indirect (i.e., mediated by differential effects on positive symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, or mood).; Significantly greater improvement was achieved with high-dose olanzapine than with placebo or haloperidol. Olanzapine had a significantly greater direct effect than placebo on all SANS dimensions except anhedonia-asociality. Olanzapine also demonstrated a significantly greater direct effect than haloperidol on negative symptoms, especially on the dimensions of affective flattening and avolition-apathy. Olanzapine's superior effects were replicated in a subgroup with SANS-defined prominent negative symptoms (N = 116) and a subgroup with a BPRS-defined cross-sectional proxy for the deficit state (N = 117).; These results suggest that the negative symptoms of schizophrenia are directly responsive to treatment. The significantly greater direct and indirect effects of olanzapine than of haloperidol on negative symptoms are likely related to olanzapine's pleotrophic pharmacology, which includes dopaminergic, serotonergic, muscarinic, and adrenergic activities. The results contribute to the hypothesis that negative symptoms may be under the influence of several neurotransmitters within one or more neuroanatomic circuits.",4,E

Compared with conventional neuroleptics, slightly more patients in the risperidone group showed clinical improvement [57 vs 52%; odds ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.56]. The use of concomitant medications for EPS was significantly less in the risperidone group than in the conventional neuroleptic group (22.8 vs 38.4%; odds ratio 0.51, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.63). The overall drop-out rate was lower in the risperidone group than in other neuroleptic group (29.1 vs 33.9%; odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61, 0.94). The difference in changes in negative PANSS score between the risperidone and the haloperidol group was -0.74 (95% CI: -1.50, 0.02). Weight gain and tachycardia are more common in patients treated with risperidone. Sensitivity analysis of different analytic approaches did not materially change the main estimates. It was concluded that the short-term efficacy of risperidone is comparable to other neuroleptics in the treatment of schizophrenia. It is associated with significantly fewer EPS than conventional neuroleptics (mainly haloperidol).",5,E

The BPRS Total and Negative Symptom scores did not correlate with pHVA for all patients, responders or non-responders at any time. The percent decrease in the BPRS Positive Symptom scores from baseline at 6 weeks following clozapine treatment correlated significantly with pHVA levels in responders.

Various risk factors for TD have been reported; a correlation between TD and substance abuse has been suggested in some reports and not found in others. This study analyzes the association of substance abuse with the incidence of tardive dyskinesia in a schizophrenic population. All patients at the West Side Veterans Affairs Medical Center are evaluated prior to the initiation of neuroleptic therapy with the Dyskinesia identification System: Condensed User Scale (DISCUS); those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder during the years 1986 through 1993 were included in this analysis. History of substance abuse was considered positive if there was clinician report or diagnosis of substance abuse. These data were collected and analyzed using ANOVA. In a sample of 1,027 subjects (97% male), 83.2 percent had a neuroleptic exposure of 10 or more years, and slightly more than half (50.8 percent) had a positive history of substance abuse. Using research diagnostic criteria, 28.9 percent of the sample had tardive dyskinesia. Analysis of variance showed history of substance abuse (p < .000) and years on neuroleptics (p < .000) to be strongly correlated to a diagnosis of TD. Age was less strongly correlated to the DISCUS score (p < .01), and there was no association of TD with diagnosis (p = .237). This study therefore demonstrates a robust correlation between TD and substance abuse. A mechanism of action involving N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated excitotoxicity is proposed.",I,6

For key pharmacokinetic values (Cmax, AUC), the 90% CIs on the relative bioequivalence of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and the active moiety were contained within the equivalence range of 80-120% (80-125% for log-transformed data). The results demonstrate that the 1-mg/ml oral solution and the 1-mg tablet are bioequivalent.",4,E

The Frankfurt Questionnaire of Complaints was used to analyze subjective complaints regarding cognitive and coping abilities. The P300 auditory event-related potential was measured at recruitment to provide an index of information-processing capability.; Patients without severe life events during the 1 month before relapse had a smaller P300, more subjective complaints, and less coping capacity than did relapsed schizophrenic subjects who had severe life events in the month before relapse.; Relapses in subjects without severe life events were associated with fewer cognitive resources and less coping ability.

However, new antipsychotic medications could potentially have an impact on aspects of disability, such as neurocognitive deficits. The authors evaluated the effects of risperidone on verbal working memory, a memory component of theoretical interest because of its link to prefrontal activity and of practical interest because of its link to psychosocial rehabilitation.; Verbal working memory of 59 treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients was assessed as part of a randomized, double-blind comparison of treatment with risperidone and haloperidol. Verbal working memory was measured under both distracting and nondistracting conditions at baseline and after 4 weeks of both fixed- and flexible-dose pharmacotherapy.; Risperidone treatment had a greater beneficial effect on verbal working memory than haloperidol treatment across testing conditions (with and without distraction) and study phases (fixed and flexible dose). The treatment effect remained significant after the effects of benztropine cotreatment, change in psychotic symptoms, and change in negative symptoms were controlled. Neither benztropine status nor symptom changes were significantly related to memory performance.; Treatment with risperidone appears to exert a more favorable effect on verbal working memory than treatment with a conventional neuroleptic. The beneficial effect appears to be due, at least partially, to a direct effect of the drug, possibly through antagonism of the 5-HT2A receptor. Results from this study suggest that pharmacotherapeutic efficacy in schizophrenia treatment could be broadened to include impact on neurocognitive abilities.",I,I

The purpose was to determine whether olanzapine demonstrated a dose-related ability to decrease overall psychopathology with minimal associated extrapyramidal symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The high-dose olanzapine group showed statistically significantly greater improvement in overall psychopathology based on mean change in the CGI Severity score and statistically significantly greater improvement in positive psychotic symptoms based on mean change in both the BPRS positive score and the PANSS positive score compared with the 1.0-mg/day olanzapine group. Analyses indicated that an increasing dose-response curve was observed across the range of all olanzapine dose groups. Acute extrapyramidal syndromes were reported less frequently among all olanzapine groups compared with the haloperidol group. Endpoint mean change on both the Simpson-Angus Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale reflected improvement for all olanzapine treatment groups compared with worsening for the haloperidol group. Olanzapine was associated with weight gain but did not appear to have any clinically meaningful effect on vital signs. Although olanzapine was associated with some increase in prolactin concentrations, increases were transient, occurred less often, and were of lesser magnitude than those observed with haloperidol.",I,4

The subjects were 523 patients with chronic schizophrenia who, after a 1-week washout period, received placebo, risperidone (2, 6, 10, or 16 mg/day), or haloperidol (20 mg/day) for 8 weeks; the trial was completed by 253 patients. Severity of EPS was assessed by means of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS). Mean changes (increases) in ESRS scores from baseline to worst score were significantly lower in each risperidone group than the haloperidol group on the total ESRS (parkinsonism + dystonia + dyskinesia), total parkinsonism, hypokinetic symptoms, and on the questionnaire (p < 0.001). On several of the subscales (dyskinesia, buccolinguomasticatory, and Clinical Global Impression severity of dyskinesia), mean change scores were significantly lower in some of the risperidone groups than in the placebo group (p < 0.05). At the clinically most effective risperidone dose (6 mg/day), the mean ESRS change score was not significantly different from that of the placebo group. A significant linear relationship was noted between mean change scores and increasing risperidone dose on 4 of the 12 ESRS subscales; nevertheless, even at 16 mg/day of risperidone, mean change scores were lower than in the haloperidol group. A linear relationship between increasing risperidone dose and use of antiparkinsonian medications was also apparent. Acute dystonic reactions occurred both in patients receiving risperidone and haloperidol. Patients with severe baseline EPS were at higher risk of EPS during the study than patients with low or moderate baseline EPS. It is concluded that low doses of risperidone cause few or no EPS and recommendations for initiation of risperidone treatment are made.",I,4

Achievements and future possibilities in optimising outcomes.,Humans; Psychotropic Drugs; Schizophrenia; Time Factors,"Fleischhacker, W W; Hummer, M","The current state of the art of the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia, and a review of the latest findings in antipsychotic drug development are presented. A first step in optimising treatment is an increase in the awareness and implementation of existing treatment standards. The introduction of clozapine challenges the view that all antipsychotics are of similar efficacy; the drug has an established superiority over some of the traditional antipsychotics in treatment-resistant patients. Newer agents such as zotepine, risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine and sertindole, which have a lower risk of producing extrapyramidal motor symptoms, have been developed in the wake of clozapine. While it is still common to switch nonresponding patients to an antipsychotic of a different chemical class, clozapine treatment remains the only strategy based on sound scientific evidence in these patients, although the novel antipsychotics give rise to hope. Alternatively, combination treatment with benzodiazepines, lithium or an anticonvulsant has been employed. If treatment with a depot antipsychotic is planned, it is advisable to start a patient on the oral form of the same drug in order to obtain dose requirements and tolerability information of the drug in that patient. Long term maintenance therapy is crucial and continuous monitoring for the development of adverse effects essential.",5,E

A total of 13359 of the 78463 adults who participated in screening interviews across six countries were identified as suffering from depression, a 6-month prevalence of 17%. Major depression accounted for 6.9% of the cases of depression and minor depression for 1.8%. Depressed subjects in both these categories perceived that their working or social lives were substantially impaired by depressive symptoms. The remaining 8.3% of depressed subjects considered that their functional impairment was not substantial. A significant proportion of sufferers from depression (43%) failed to seek treatment for their depressive symptoms. Of those who did seek help (57%), most consulted a primary care physician, the frequency of consultation increasing with the severity of depression. Sufferers from major depression imposed the greatest demand on healthcare resources, making almost three times as many visits to their GP or family doctor as non-sufferers (4.4 vs 1.5 visits over 6 months). More than two-thirds of depressed subjects (69%) were not prescribed any treatment and when drug therapy was prescribed (31%), only 25% of these subjects were given antidepressant drugs. The number of days of work lost due to illness increased with the severity of depression. Major depression had most impact on productive work, with sufferers losing four times as many working days over 6 months as non-sufferers. The results of the DEPRES survey confirm the high prevalence of depression in the community and the burden imposed on the individual sufferer in terms of impaired quality of life and on society in terms of healthcare utilization and lost productivity.",5,E

Patients were monitored weekly by three methods of extrapyramidal symptom assessment: (1) detection of extrapyramidal adverse events (signs and symptoms) by casual observation, nonprobing inquiry, and spontaneous report; (2) objective rating scale scores: and (3) use of concomitant anticholinergic medications. Emergence of EPS was assessed by (1) analysis of the incidence of extrapyramidal syndrome categories based on adverse events, (2) the incidence of extrapyramidal syndromes based on categorical analysis of rating scale scores, (3) analysis of mean maximum change in rating scale scores, and (4) categorical analysis of anticholinergic medication use. Outcome of EPS was assessed by (1) analysis of mean change in rating scale scores at endpoint and (2) mean anticholinergic use at endpoint.; Olanzapine was statistically significantly (p = .014, p < .001) superior to haloperidol in all four analyses related to emergence of EPS and in the two analyses related to outcome. Furthermore, during acute treatment, statistically significantly fewer patients treated with olanzapine (0.3%) discontinued the study because of any extrapyramidal adverse event than patients treated with haloperidol (2.7%, p < .001).; Olanzapine exhibited a statistically significantly lower extrapyramidal symptom profile than the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol at comparably effective antipsychotic doses. The lower extrapyramidal symptom profile with olanzapine was evident despite statistically significantly more frequent use of anticholinergic drugs among haloperidol-treated patients. Fewer olanzapine-treated than haloperidol-treated patients discontinued because of EPS, suggesting that olanzapine should contribute to better compliance with longer term maintenance treatment, with minimal anticholinergic-associated events.",I,5

Secondary efficacy variables included the BPRS positive-symptom cluster score, the Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms summary score (United States only), and the total score from the negative scale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (Europe only). Scores were analyzed using an analysis of covariance for change from baseline at end point with last observations carried forward. The model included baseline score (covariate), center, and treatment. Extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed using the Simpson-Angus Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale; abnormal involuntary movements were assessed using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale.

There was a significant relationship between change in cortisol level and change in psychopathology under m-CPP; a blunted cortisol response was associated with a decrease in total psychopathology, while an increase in cortisol response related to an increase in psychopathology. Similarly, decrease in severity of the activation factor and the hostility factor was associated with a smaller cortisol response in the m-CPP condition.

Because many of the studies on aggressive populations allowed the use of concomitant medications, it is unclear whether the efficacy of each drug in a particular population is dependent on the presence of other medications, such as antipsychotic agents. Finally, one needs to be circumspect in inferring efficacy of a particular drug in aggressive patients with neuropsychiatric conditions other than the ones in which some efficacy has been established. Lithium appears to be an effective treatment of aggression among nonepileptic prison inmates, mentally retarded and handicapped patients, and among conduct-disordered children with explosive behavior. Certainly, lithium would be the treatment of choice in bipolar patients with excessive irritability and anger outbursts, and it has been shown to be effective in this population. Anticonvulsant medications are the treatment of choice for patients with outbursts of rage and abnormal EEG findings. The efficacy of these drugs in patients without a seizure disorder, however, remains to be established, with the exception perhaps of valproate and carbamazepine. In fact, dyphenylhydantoin did not appear to be effective in treating aggressive behavior in children with temper tantrums and was found to be effective in only a prison population. There is some evidence for the efficacy of carbamazepine and valproate in treating pathologic aggression in patients with dementia, organic brain syndrome, psychosis, and personality disorders. As Yudofsky et al point out in their review of the literature, although traditional antipsychotic drugs have been used widely to treat aggression, there is little evidence for their effectiveness in treating aggression beyond their sedative effect in agitated patients or their antiaggressive effect among patients whose aggression is related to active psychosis. Antipsychotic agents appear to be effective in treating psychotic aggressive patients, conduct-disordered children, and mentally retarded patients, with only modest effects in the management of pathologic aggression in patients with dementia. Furthermore, at least in one study, these drugs were found to be associated with increased aggressiveness in mentally retarded subjects. On the other hand, atypical antipsychotic agents (i.e., clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine) may be more effective than traditional antipsychotic drugs in aggressive and violent populations, as they have shown efficacy in patients with dementia, brain injury, mental retardation, and personality disorders. Similarly, benzodiazepines can reduce agitation and irritability in elderly and demented populations, but they also can induce behavioral disinhibition. Therefore, one should be careful in using this class of drugs in patients with pathologic aggression. Beta-blockers appear to be effective in many different neuropsychiatric conditions. These drugs seem effective in reducing violent and assaultive behavior in patients with dementia, brain injury, schizophrenia, mental retardation, and organic brain syndrome. As pointed out by Campbell et al in their review of the literature, however, systematic research is lacking, and little is known about the efficacy and safety of beta-blockers in children and adolescents with pathologic aggression. Although widely used in the management of pathologic aggression, the use of this class of drugs has been limited partially by marked hypotension and bradycardia, which are side effects common at the higher doses. The usefulness of the antihypertensive drug clonidine in the treatment of pathologic aggression has not been assessed adequately, and only marginal benefits were observed with this drug in irritable autistic and conduct disorder children. Psychostimulants seem to be effective in reducing aggressiveness in brain-injured patients as well as in violent adolescents with oppositional or conduct disorders, particu",4,E

Clozapine, given orally at bedtime, was started at a dose of 6.25 mg and titrated upward to the minimal effective dose. In all patients, psychosis responded to very low clozapine doses (mean 10.59 +/- 6.48 mg/day). Clozapine doses correlated with the severity of psychosis. During clozapine treatment, parkinsonian disabilities and levodopa dosage remained statistically unchanged. During the 12-month study, no patient had clozapine-induced agranulocytosis or other severe side effects.

Mean utility values (confidence interval 95%) obtained from the SG ratings for the three health state profiles were 0.61 +/- 0.069 (mild); 0.36 +/- 0.073 (moderate); and 0.29 +/- 0.071 (severe). The mild health state (including the majority of risperidone 6 mg-treated patients) was rated by nurses to have a 0.25 +/- 0.0501 greater utility than the moderate health state (composed of the majority of haloperidol-treated patients). The results of these utility evaluations (SG) by the nurses were related to the clinical outcome for three of the six drug treatment groups (N = 65) by multiplying the percentage of patients in each of the three clusters, both at baseline and end-point, who were receiving risperidone 6 mg/day, haloperidol, or placebo, by the utility value for the health state assigned to that cluster. The gain in utility for risperidone-treated patients was 2.6 times higher (0.125) compared with haloperidol-treated patients (0.049), and 7 times higher compared with placebo (-0.021). After multiplying the gain in utility of each treatment by the remaining expected life span for men and women, it was found that risperidone-treated patients obtained more than twice as many quality-adjusted years as haloperidol patients. The incremental drug treatment cost divided by the incremental benefit of risperidone versus haloperidol was found to yield a favorable, generally accepted cost-utility ratio.",6,E

Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) increase was most frequently seen in both treatment groups. When analyzing the incidence rates for patients with increased liver enzyme values (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, SGPT, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) that were higher than twice the upper limit of the normal range, clozapine-treated patients showed an SGPT increase (37.3%) significantly more frequently than patients treated with haloperidol (16.6%). Both patients with higher clozapine plasma levels and male patients were at a higher risk for an SGPT increase. At least 60% of the increase of the different enzymes remitted within the first 13 weeks of treatment. In general, the authors conclude that clozapine-induced liver enzyme elevation seems to be a common and mostly transient phenomenon.",I,I

The treatment of this patient population must always take into consideration the effect of that treatment on the fetus. With regard to the high risk of decompensation during pregnancy and postpartum, continuous antipsychotic medication is needed using the minimum effective dose. The use of high-potency agents appears to be preferable for first-line management, as there are few data regarding the use of atypical agents such as clozapine in pregnancy. Guidelines for treating pregnant women with psychoses vary little from those for nonpregnant patients. Clinicians must always carefully weigh up the risks and benefits for each patient on an individual basis.",5,E

Forty Chinese schizophrenic patients were recruited in a 12-week, double-blind, comparative trial. Twenty-one patients were randomly assigned to clozapine treatment and 19 to chlorpromazine treatment. The average dose was 543 +/- 157 and 1163 +/- 228 mg/day for clozapine and chlorpromazine, respectively. The results showed that six clozapine-treated patients (28.6%) had more than 20% improvement in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score and were classified as responders, whereas none of the chlorpromazine-treated patients was classified as a responder. The degree of improvement in positive symptoms, negative symptoms and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores in the clozapine group was inversely correlated with the severity of negative symptoms at entry into the trial. Two clozapine-treated patients were withdrawn from the study, one because of leukopenia and nausea, and the other because of vomiting and hypotension. Chlorpromazine treatment was prematurely discontinued in two patients, because of jaundice and over sedation in one, and because of severe weight loss in the other (9 kg). The rate of moderate-to-severe sialorrhea was high in clozapine-treated patients (28.6%). Two clozapine-treated patients and two chlorpromazine-treated patients showed significant improvement in previously existing tardive dyskinesia and one chlorpromazine-treated patient exhibited aggravation of tardive dyskinesia. The results of this study indicate that clozapine treatment might have advantages over chlorpromazine for Chinese schizophrenic patients who are refractory to typical neuroleptic treatment.",I,4

In this preliminary study, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of methylene blue (MB), a ""downstream"" inhibitor of one of NO's actions, administered orally as an adjuvant to conventional neuroleptic medications. Specifically, MB blocks NO's activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase. MB has previously been reported to have therapeutic effects in the treatment of psychosis and mania. Preclinical data also suggest that MB might possess antipsychotic potential. Participants in the current study were eight patients with schizophrenia who had incomplete responses to conventional antipsychotics (as evidenced by a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] total score of 35 or more). These patients completed a 4-week open-label study with a 1 week ""off"", 2 week ""on"", and one final week ""off"" design. Measures of treatment efficacy were the BPRS, Schedule for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and Clinical Global Improvement Scale administered weekly. Final scores for each outcome measure item were based on the consensus of at least two trained raters present during each rating interview. A statistically significant, albeit modest, decrease in the severity of psychopathology was observed while the subjects were taking MB, and psychopathology significantly worsened when MB was discontinued. The results suggest a need for further study with MB or perhaps other NO-dependent guanylyl cyclase-inhibiting medications.",3,E

At the end of the study, compared with the baseline, both treatment groups reported comparable improvement in negative symptoms as defined by the protocol (at least 20% improvement). Similarly, both groups showed comparable changes on global and multidimensional self-assessments of quality of life. All the subfactors of the modified version of the SIP were similar in both groups, except for the subfactor that relates to alertness behavior, which possibly reflects remoxipride's lack of any sedating properties compared with haloperidol. This study presents an approach for inclusion of quality of life as an outcome measure in the design of clinical trials of new antipsychotic medications.",3,E

These studies suggest an important role of the 5-HT2A gene in schizophrenia. To study the possible involvement of the 5-HT2A gene in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, a case-control association study was carried out in a Chinese population from Taiwan. No significant differences of genotype distributions, allele frequencies and homozygosity were detected between schizophrenic patients (n = 177) and nonpsychiatric controls (n = 98).

Three hundred sixty-one patients from 26 North American centers entered this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with acute exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R). Patients who completed a single-blind, placebo washout phase were randomized to double-blind treatment with quetiapine (75, 150, 300, 600, or 750 mg daily), haloperidol (12 mg daily), or placebo and evaluated weekly for 6 weeks. At end point, significant differences (p < 0.05, analysis of covariance) in adjusted mean changes from baseline were identified between the four highest doses of quetiapine and placebo for BPRS total, BPRS positive-symptom cluster, and CGI Severity of Illness item scores and between quetiapine 300 mg and placebo for SANS summary score. Differences between quetiapine and haloperidol were not significant. Dose-response modeling showed significant linear and quadratic functions of quetiapine dose for all primary efficacy variables. Notably, no significant safety concerns were identified as dose increased. Quetiapine was no different from placebo across the dose range studied regarding incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms or change in prolactin concentrations. Quetiapine is well tolerated and clinically effective in the treatment of schizophrenia.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is an endogenous hematopoietic growth factor that plays a pivotal role in granulopoiesis. In addition, G-CSF has successfully been used to treat clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. We performed a longitudinal investigation of the plasma levels of G-CSF in 20 schizophrenic patients during six weeks of clozapine treatment. Clozapine transiently increased plasma G-CSF levels in 55% of the subjects studied. This effect was most prominent at the end of the second week of treatment. Increased G-CSF levels were accompanied by increased granulocyte and monocyte counts, increased rectal temperature and increased plasma levels of other cytokines and cytokine receptors. The results presented suggest that G-CSF is involved in clozapine-induced increases in granulocyte counts seen early during treatment. Like granulocytosis, granulocytopenia is known to occur in conjunction with increased systemic G-CSF levels. Therefore, we hypothesize that a persistent increase along with a decline in white cell counts following an early spike during clozapine treatment might predict the occurrence of agranulocytosis.",6,E

Subjects were treated with clozapine for at least 12 months, regardless of response status, according to a standardized, increasing dose protocol. Behavioral changes were measured through monthly assessments with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale.; Thirty-four subjects (68%) met clinical response criteria by the end of the trial. Response was achieved at a mean dose of 468 mg/day (SD = 168). The dose of 30 (88%) of the responding patients was 600 mg/day or less. The mean time to response was 82 days (SD = 100, range = 10-401). It took an average of 60 days (SD = 87) for subjects to reach the dose at which clozapine response was achieved. Once this dose was reached, the average response time was 17 days (SD = 14, range = 2-56). All 34 subjects who responded met criteria within 8 weeks of a clozapine dose escalation. No late response was found in the remaining 16 subjects despite a mean follow-up period of 75 weeks (SD = 50).; In this study, all patients who responded to clozapine did so within 8 weeks of a change in dose.

The tolerabilities of the two treatments were also compared. The mean daily doses of quetiapine and chlorpromazine at the end of the study were 407 mg and 384 mg, respectively. Both treatments were effective in the treatment of positive and negative symptoms, with a trend towards superior efficacy for quetiapine. The quetiapine group had a lower incidence of adverse events than the chlorpromazine group, and a low incidence of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms. Quetiapine was not associated with a sustained increase in serum prolactin. These clinical data support the preclinical profile of quetiapine as an atypical antipsychotic agent.",I,4
9355136,"Assessment and treatment selection for ""revolving door"" inpatients with schizophrenia.","Acute Disease; Adult; Female; Hospitalization; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Male; Recurrence; Schizophrenia","Weiden, P; Glazer, W","The goals of this study are 1) to determine causes and patterns of relapse for a cohort of ""revolving door"" schizophrenia inpatients, and 2) to assess the feasibility of starting a new psychopharmacologic intervention before discharge, either depot therapy or an atypical antipsychotic.; Consecutive admissions to an acute inpatient unit in New York City were screened for ""revolving door"" criteria. Patients had to have a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and have either 1) two hospitalizations in the last year, or 2) three hospitalizations in the last three years. Patients were then assessed for probable causes of relapse for the index and prior two hospitalizations. Treatment selection, based on this information, was trichotomized to: 1) oral conventional antipsychotic, 2) depot conventional antipsychotic (either haloperidol or fluphenazine decanoate), or 3) atypical antipsychotic (either risperidone or clozapine).; Sixty-three out of 131 screened admissions met the above revolving door criteria. They were indeed ""revolving"", having an average of 1.3 hospitalizations per year over the last 3 years and were only out of the hospital for five months (median) before index admission. The treatment selection process was hampered by lack of information about events leading to relapse, and by the lack of outpatient participation in the medication selection process. Of the 50 patients with complete histories about precipitants for the index episode, the most common reason for rehospitalization was judged to be medication noncompliance (n = 25; 50%), followed by medication nonresponse (n = 13; 26%). Not surprisingly, medication recommendations were closely linked to the assessed reason for relapse (depot therapy [n = 27; 49%] with medication noncompliance; atypical antipsychotic [n = 20; 37%] with medication nonresponse [X2 = 26.9, p < .001]). These two recommendations were implemented before discharge for about one-half of the cases. Patient refusal was a relatively greater problem for depot recommendation while constraints in the outpatient environment were more problematic for patients recommended for atypical antipsychotics.; Medication noncompliance and medication nonresponse, in that order, were judged to be the most common causes of relapse for ""revolving door"" inpatients. Both depot therapy and atypical antipsychotics were commonly recommended and ultimately accepted by about 2/3rds of patients. Choice between depot and atypical was driven by the assessed cause of relapse. In summary, it seems possible to identify ""revolving door"" inpatients, and to target specific medication interventions within the time frame of an acute inpatient admission.",2,E

The purpose of this study was to document loxapine's 5-HT2 and D2 receptor occupancy in vivo in patients with psychoses.; Ten patients who were taking loxapine (10-100 mg/day) had their D2 and 5-HT2 receptors assessed by means of positron emission tomography with [11C]raclopride and [18F]setoperone, respectively.; The D2 receptor occupancy ranged from 43% to 90%; 5-HT2 occupancy varied from 27% to near saturation. Statistical comparison of the results showed that loxapine was equipotent in blocking 5-HT2 and D2 receptors.; Loxapine differs from typical neuroleptics in demonstrating a high degree of 5-HT2 receptor occupancy. However, it is not ""atypical"" like clozapine and risperidone, since its 5-HT2 occupancy is not higher than its D2 occupancy. The results demonstrate that a high level of 5-HT2 occupancy is not a sufficient condition for atypicality. If atypical antipsychotic action is predicated on a combination of 5-HT2 and D2 effects, then it requires > 80% 5-HT2 occupancy in conjunction with < 80% D2 occupancy.",6,E

Elevations have been associated with both acute (galactorrhea, amenorrhea) and chronic (predisposition to osteoporosis) treatment-emergent adverse events. One of the defining criteria for an atypical antipsychotic is the relative lack of persistent prolactinemia. A double-blind, placebo- (N = 68) and haloperidol- (Hal: 15 +/- 5 mg/day, N = 69) controlled trial of three dose ranges of olanzapine (Olz-L: 5 +/- 2.5 mg/day, N = 65; Olz-M: 10 +/- 2.5 mg/day, N = 64; Olz-H: 15 +/- 2.5 mg/day, N = 69) in the treatment of schizophrenia afforded the opportunity to assess the temporal course of the influence of olanzapine and haloperidol on serum prolactin concentration. Consistent with its potent D2 antagonism, haloperidol was associated with a statistically significantly higher incidence of treatment-emergent prolactin elevation (72%) than seen with placebo (8%; p < 0.001) at week 2 of therapy. Expectedly, this elevation was also persistent at weeks 4 and 6. In contrast, olanzapine-associated treatment-emergent prolactin elevations were both lower in magnitude and transient. At week 2, 38% of the Olz-H, 24% of the Olz-M, and 13% of the Olz-L treatment groups exhibited a treatment-emergent prolactin elevation, with a mean increase of 0.35, 0.52, and 0.61 nmol/l, respectively; for haloperidol the mean increase was 1.23 nmol/l. For only the Olz-M and the Olz-H treatment groups did the week 2 incidence of treatment-emergent prolactin elevations differ statistically significantly from placebo. Both the incidence of elevations and the mean increase, in prolactin concentration were less than that seen with haloperidol. Furthermore, by treatment week 6, all three olanzapine groups exhibited incidences of treatment-emergent prolactin elevation that were comparable to placebo and were statistically significantly less than observed with haloperidol. Rapid adaptation was observed in the temporal course of prolactin elevations associated with olanzapine based on both the categorical analysis of treatment-emergent high values and the analyses of temporal change in mean concentrations. In contrast to haloperidol, the magnitudes of the treatment-emergent elevations associated with olanzapine were minimal. The rates of elevation were approximately one-half to one-third those observed with haloperidol and were significantly more transient. Olanzapine, even at the highest doses (15 +/- 2.5 mg/day) used, was not associated with persistent elevations of prolactin, consistent with an 'atypical' pharmacologic profile.",2,E

In this paper, the literature surveying the uses of clozapine in the treatment of patients with nonschizophrenic illnesses, in particular psychotic affective disorders (bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder), will be reviewed. (A Medline search was done for all papers concerning clozapine; those that represented major contributions to the literature were used.) Results from a prospective study at McLean Hospital assessing the effects of diagnosis on response will be presented. Several other uses in nonschizophrenic patients will also be discussed. Because of its relative freedom from extrapyramidal side effects, it is an important agent in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease who also have psychotic symptoms. It may be effective in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in nearly 50% of patients with that symptom. In addition, the drug may be useful in treating violent patients and those with certain movement disorders, atypical borderline personality disorder, or chronic psychotic symptoms. Due to the risk of agranulocytosis, clozapine cannot yet be considered a first-choice treatment for psychotic symptoms, but many studies indicate it to be helpful with a wide variety of treatment-resistant ones.",5,E

The manufacturer of the drug, Eli Lilly and Company, provided the clinical investigator's brochure and abstracts of unpublished Phase III clinical trials.; Animal studies evaluating the pharmacology of olanzapine were evaluated, as were all open-label and double-blind studies involving the evaluation of olanzapine for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia.; All available clinical studies were reviewed and the interpretation of data for each study was influenced by the size of the study sample, the nature of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the data analysis techniques used.; Olanzapine is a thienobenzodiazepine analog with an in vitro receptor affinity profile similar to that of clozapine. Olanzapine exhibits linear kinetics over the dosage range studied and is extensively metabolized in humans. Clinical evaluations to date have shown olanzapine to be at least as efficacious as typical antipsychotic agents in the treatment of the acute phase of schizophrenia. The drug was well tolerated, with significantly fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects than haloperidol. Current data suggest that olanzapine may be more effective than haloperidol for the treatment of negative symptoms; moreover, preliminary data suggest that fewer relapses occur over the course of treatment in patients treated with olanzapine compared with those taking haloperidol.; The exact place of olanzapine in the therapy of psychotic patients remains unclear, as more data are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of this agent, its impact on negative symptoms, and its potential use in patients resistant to the standard agents.

A critical review of the evidence.,"Anti-Anxiety Agents; Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic; Antipsychotic Agents; Benzodiazepines; Central Nervous System Agents; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Drug Interactions; Enzyme Inhibitors; Humans; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors","Sproule, B A; Naranjo, C A; Brenmer, K E; Hassan, P C","The potential for drug-drug interactions in psychiatric patients is very high as combination psychopharmacotherapy used to treat comorbid psychiatric disorders, to treat the adverse effects of a medication, to augment a medication effect or to treat concomitant medical illnesses. Interactions can be pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic in nature. This paper focuses on the metabolic kinetic interactions between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other central nervous system (CNS) drugs. The evidence for and clinical significance of these interactions are reviewed, with special emphasis on antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Many psychotropic medications have an affinity for the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes which promote elimination by transforming lipid soluble substances into more polar compounds. SSRIs serve both as substrates and inhibitors of these enzymes. In vitro studies provide a screening method for evaluating drug affinities for substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP enzymes. Although in vitro data are important as a starting point for predicting these metabolic kinetic drug interactions, case reports and controlled experimental studies in humans are required to fully evaluate their clinical significance. Several factors must be considered when evaluating the clinical significance of a potential interaction including: (a) the nature of each drugs' activity at an enzyme site (substrate, inhibitor or inducer); (b) the potency estimations for the inhibitor/inducer; (c) the concentration of the inhibitor/inducer at the enzyme site; (d) the saturability of the enzyme; (e) the extent of metabolism of the substrate through this enzyme (versus alternative metabolic routes); (f) the presence of active metabolites of the substrate; (g) the therapeutic window of the substrate; (h) the inherent enzyme activity of the individual, phenotyping/genotyping information; (i) the level of risk of the individual experiencing adverse effects (e.g. the elderly) and (j) from an epidemiological perspective, the probability of concurrent use. This paper systematically reviews both the in vitro and in vivo evidence for drug interactions between SSRIs and other CNS drugs. As potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, both paroxetine and fluoxetine have the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of antipsychotic medications metabolised through this enzyme, including perphenazine, haloperidol, thioridazine and risperidone in patients who are CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers. Controlled studies have demonstrated this for perphenazine with paroxetine and haloperidol with fluoxetine. Fluvoxamine, as a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, can inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, resulting in higher plasma concentrations. Drug interactions between the SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can occur. Fluoxetine and paroxetine, as potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, can increase the plasma concentrations of secondary and tertiary tricyclic antidepressants. Sertraline and citalopram are less likely to have this effect. Fluvoxamine can increase the plasma concentrations of tertiary TCAs. Fluvoxamine inhibits, via CYP3A. CYP2C19 and CYP1A2, the metabolism of several benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, bromazepam and diazepam. Fluoxetine increases the plasma concentrations of alprazolam and diazepam by inhibiting CYP3A and CYP2C19, respectively. The clinical importance of the interaction with diazepam is attenuated by the presence of its active metabolite. Sertraline inhibits these enzymes only mildely to moderately at usual therapeutic doses. Therefore the potential for interactions is less; however, the in vivo evidence is minimal. Paroxetine and citalopram are unlikely to cause interactions with benzodiazepines. The evidence is conflicting for an interaction between carbamazepine and the SSRIs fluoxetine and fluvoxamine. These combinations should be used cautiously, and be accompanied by monitoring for adverse events and carb",5,E

These twenty patients had previously shown long-term resistance to usual neuroleptics but three out of them met the diagnosis of mental retardation or childhood disintegrative disorder (F.84.3-ICD 10). These patients were put under clozapine for their violent behavior. The methodology was retrospective, descriptive with intra-individual comparison, each patient being his own reference before and after treatment. Diagnosis met CD 10 criteria and were assessed without using standard examination. This study aimed at assessing once more clozapine efficacy and tolerance upon a long time follow up. Single therapy has been the rule and dosages have been progressively increased reaching a mean daily dosage of 350 mg per day. The efficacy, assessed by the way of BPRS, GAF (DSM III-R) and simplified form of CGIS, has been verified in approximately 30% of the patients, mainly concerning positive symptoms. Clozapine was also able to alleviate severe behavior troubles brought about by delusional states, without this latter being markedly softened when it was a long term one. Clozapine tolerance has shown it to be satisfactory, however we noticed the occurrence of a leucopenia with neutropenia after seventeen weeks of treatment, followed, some days later, by a Quincke oedema, which forced to interrupt the treatment. White blood cells came back in a normal range fifteen days later. The other side effects (transitory hypersialorrhea, tachycardia, without clinical and ECG perturbations) have been usually well tolerated and have never caused treatment interruption. No extrapyramidal side effect have been noticed among our twenty patients. The end of this paper consists in the presentation of four clinical cases: one about the efficacy of clozapine upon violent antisocial behaviour in a schizotypital disorder; one delusional chronic schizophrenic patient whose violence has been controlled despite of the delusion; one paranoid schizophrenic patient who has been able to maintain a satisfactory professional and family adaptation; and finally a childhood disintegrative disorder (F.84.3-ICD 10) in whom occurred the only leucopenia side effect of our study. These four clinical cases have seemed particularly meaningful regarding our clinical experience of clozapine which has been lasting for almost seven years now.",1,E
9468354,Factors influencing relapse in the long-term course of schizophrenia.,Antipsychotic Agents; Family Health; Humans; Patient Compliance; Risk Factors; Schizophrenia; Secondary Prevention,"Ayuso-Guti茅rrez, J L; del R铆o Vega, J M","Highly effective neuroleptic drugs have been available for the past 40 years, but 50% of schizophrenic patients, under normal treatment conditions, relapse within 1 year after their latest episode, frequently spending 15-20% of their time in psychiatric institutions. The term relapse usually refers to a deterioration or recurrence of positive rather than negative features, and relapses appear to impair the course of the disease. Impairment is often longer than expected for those patients who discontinue antipsychotic medication and then relapse to their prediscontinuation clinical state of function. Drug therapy is an important defense against relapse. Marked differences in relapse rate between patients receiving placebo and neuroleptic drugs have been observed (approximately 69% after 1 year for the placebo group versus 26% for the neuroleptic group). First-year relapse rates can be reduced from 75% to 15% with prophylactic treatment with neuroleptics. Follow-up studies suggest that noncompliance with medication, pharmacological factors, psychosocial factors and alcohol and drug abuse contribute to setting off new psychotic episodes. The most important of these is noncompliance with medication. The overwhelming majority of schizophrenic patients who suffered a clinical exacerbation and required hospitalization (73%) did not comply with the treatment prescribed. The effect of new antipsychotic agents should be examined in patients who relapse despite maintenance treatment with conventional neuroleptics. We have found that the rate of current drug abuse among patients with schizophrenic relapse (44%) was significantly higher than that in schizophrenic patients who regularly attended outpatient clinics. Also, the rate of alcohol and substance abuse is higher in males (79%) than in females (21%). Psychiatric units should integrate addiction treatments with psychotic-relapse management.",I,5

However, the recent re-emergence of clozapine, together with the emergence of risperidone, portends an increasing number of new antipsychotics which are now either traversing the stages of regulatory approval or else well-advanced in clinical development. This article first evaluates the significance of clozapine and risperidone; it then reviews some of the new antipsychotics and how they might be classified vis-a-vis potential advantages for patients, outlines putative mechanisms and new therapeutic targets, and considers whether such agents may act on any disease process inherent to schizophrenia. One fundamental issue is the extent to which the new antipsychotics might shift materially the risk benefit balance towards intervention, not just at the earliest possible stage following the onset of psychosis but at a yet earlier, 'prodromal' phase of the disorder where there is a considerably greater likelihood of 'treating' behavioural disturbances that prove not to be the harbingers of psychotic illness.",5,E

Discovery of the hallucinogenic compounds called methylated indolealkyalamines (MIAs) (e.g. N,N-dimethylserotonin, or bufotenin, and N,N-dimethyltryptamine, or DMT) led proponents of the transmethylation hypothesis of schizophrenia to theorize that through some inborn error of metabolism, serotonin or tryptamine might undergo the addition of extra methyl radicals, thereby forming MIAs with hallucinogenic properties. Various studies have attempted to detect the excretion of MIAs, especially DMT, in the body fluids of psychotic patients and normal controls. Some of these studies have demonstrated elevated MIA concentrations in psychotic patients, including those with schizophrenia, compared with normal persons, and others have not. A number of variables may account for these contradictory findings. The mechanism whereby the beverage ayahuasca, which is used in certain cure and divination rituals in the Amazon Basin, exerts its hallucinogenic effects may serve as a model to explain the mechanism underlying hallucinogenic symptoms in schizophrenia and may lend support to the transmethylation hypothesis. Certain studies suggest that specific perceptual disturbances manifested by schizophrenic patients could contribute to progressive deterioration and negative symptomatology. All these findings point to the need for further study of the neurophysiology of MIAs and their pathogenetic role in endogenous psychoses.",5,E

Ziprasidone had a significant effect on area under the curve (AUC0-infinity), maximum serum concentration, and half-life (analysis of variance all p<0.05), with the mean AUC0-infinity being significantly greater (627.2 +/- 206.4 vs 371.0 +/- 126.5 ng x hr/ml, ANOVA with Bonferroni's criteria p<0.016) and half-life significantly shorter (4.7 +/- 0.8 vs 6.6 +/- 1.3 hrs, ANOVA with Bonferroni's criteria p<0.016) after treatment B compared with treatment A. Although similar trends were observed after treatment C compared with treatment A, the differences did not reach statistical significance when Bonferroni's correction criteria were applied (p>0.016).; These data suggest an increase in systemic exposure to the highly lipophilic compound ziprasidone when taken after fatty foods, possibly due to improved drug dissolution and solubilization. The drug's longer half-life under fasting conditions may reflect dissolution-limited absorption, although this could not be directly assessed. Despite postprandial increases in ziprasidone AUC0-infinity and maximum concentration, daytime vigilance was not affected.",6,E

Thirty patients were treated with clozapine at a target dose of 2.5 to 3.0 mg/kg of body weight. After gradual dose escalation, serum concentrations of clozapine and two metabolites were determined twice at 7-day intervals after steady-state conditions had been reached. Then, fluvoxamine (50 mg/day) or paroxetine (20 mg/day) was added in 16 and 14 patients, respectively. Serum concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites were measured after 1, 7, and 14 days of coadministration with the SSRI. Mean trough concentrations of steady-state serum concentrations of clozapine, N-desmethylclozapine, and clozapine N-oxide were markedly elevated under fluvoxamine by about threefold of baseline concentrations whereas paroxetine induced only minor, nonsignificant changes. Estimation of the mean elimination half-life of clozapine 2 weeks after start of fluvoxamine comedication revealed an increase from 17 hours to about 50 hours whereas there was no change under paroxetine coadministration. The N-desmethylclozapine/clozapine ratio did not change significantly with either SSRI. Under monotherapy, clozapine mean serum concentrations in smokers were significantly lower by 32% compared with nonsmokers. Similarly, N-demethylation ratios were about 20 to 50% higher in smokers. Thus, in all patients, fluvoxamine induced relevant increases in serum concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, probably by the inhibition of enzymes catalyzing the degradation of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine, whereas paroxetine, at a usual clinically effective dosage of 20 mg/day, did not cause significant pharmacokinetic interactions.",3,E

Criticisms of the original CGI were addressed by correcting inconsistencies in scaling, identifying time frames for comparison, clarifying definitions of illness severity and change, and separating out assessment of treatment side effects from illness improvement during treatment. A Detailed User's Guide was developed to train clinicians in the use of the new CGI-Bipolar Version (CGI-BP) for rating severity of manic and depressive episodes and the degree of change from the immediately preceding phase and from the worst phase of illness. The revised scale and manual provide a focused set of instructions to facilitate the reliability of these ratings of mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness during treatment of an acute episode or in longer-term illness prophylaxis. Interrater reliability of the scale was demonstrated in preliminary analyses. Thus, the modified CGI-BP is anticipated to be more useful than the original CGI in studies of bipolar disorder.",E,E

The D3 receptor gene (DRD3) contains a polymorphism resulting in a serine-glycine substitution in the N-terminus of the receptor. Shaikh and colleagues have reported a significant association between the DRD3 Ser9 allele and the Ser9/Ser9 genotype with schizophrenia in 133 Caucasians. In a meta-analysis of previous studies, Ser9 and the Ser9/Ser9 genotype were found to be significantly associated with schizophrenia, although these investigators could not confirm reports of excess homozygosity at this locus in schizophrenia. These authors also report that, in an unblinded study, the Ser9/Ser9 genotype was more frequent in patients who did not respond to clozapine. These data represent the most comprehensive examination of DRD3 Ser9Gly in schizophrenia to date. We have therefore determined DRD3 Ser9Gly genotypes in 58 patients with schizophrenia and in their parents. Moreover, we have genotyped 68 schizophrenics participating in double-blind clozapine trials. We do not find that Ser9 is preferentially transmitted in schizophrenia, cannot confirm excess DRD3 homozygosity in schizophrenia, and do not replicate the association between DRD3 and clozapine response. These data suggest that allelic variation in DRD3 may not play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia or in clozapine response.",5,E

Using data from medical record reviews and patient interviews, the PORT assessed the conformance of current care with 12 of the Treatment Recommendations. The rates at which patients' treatment conformed to the recommendations were modest at best, generally below 50 percent. Conformance rates were higher for pharmacological than for psychosocial treatments and in rural areas than in urban ones. Rates of Treatment Recommendation conformance for minority patients were lower than those for Caucasians, and patterns of care varied between the two States. The findings indicate that current usual treatment practices likely fall substantially short of what would be recommended based on the best evidence on treatment efficacy.

The long-term study was conducted in a study sample of 40 young patients (age 14-22 years) following a mean of 3.4 years of neuroleptic treatment. During the study, 20 patients received clozapine, and the other 20 patients were treated with standard neuroleptic medications. At the beginning of the open clinical trials, the patients had already been receiving clozapine treatment for 24 +/- 15 months. Assessment of the biochemical and psychopathological measures was performed on six occasions at consecutive 6-week intervals during maintenance treatment with clozapine or conventional neuroleptics. Blood levels of serotonin, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol (MHPG), norepinephrine, and epinephrine were significantly higher in clozapine-treated patients than in conventionally treated patients. During long-term treatment, higher serotonin levels were associated with significantly fewer negative symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas higher MHPG levels were correlated with less depression. The short-term effects of clozapine were assessed in a second and independent study sample. After failing on conventional neuroleptics in clinical trials lasting a mean of 1.6 years, 15 inpatients (aged 11-20 years) received clozapine. Weekly ratings of psychopathological symptoms using standard rating scales were performed in parallel to blood samplings for measurements of biogenic amines and serum levels of clozapine. These measures were obtained for 6 weeks during conventional neuroleptic treatment and for 6 weeks during the open-label clozapine trial. Serum levels of serotonin and plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly higher during treatment with clozapine than during pretreatment with typical neuroleptics. A comparison of plasma epinephrine levels in responders (n = 7) and nonresponders (n = 8) to clozapine revealed that response to clozapine can be predicted by epinephrine levels prior to initiation of treatment with clozapine (responders ranging from 32.2 to 90.3 pg/ml; nonresponders ranging from 92.5 to 473.5 pg/ml). Additionally, subjects who responded to clozapine showed increased mean plasma concentrations of MHPG and epinephrine during treatment with this drug in comparison to the levels measured during pretreatment with typical neuroleptic medication. Nonresponders to clozapine failed to show this increase. Finally, in responders to clozapine a negative linear relationship between negative symptoms of schizophrenia and the concentrations of plasma norepinephrine and serum serotonin were observed. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that plasma epinephrine levels prior to initiation of clozapine therapy predict response to this atypical neuroleptic. Our findings derived from short-term and maintenance treatment with clozapine suggest involvement of norepinephrine, epinephrine and serotonin in the therapeutic actions of the atypical neuroleptic clozapine.",I,2

Imipramine pharmacokinetics serve as a marker for hepatic CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A activity. An open-label, three-way randomized crossover study was done to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and potential for a drug interaction between olanzapine (5 mg) and imipramine (75 mg). Each drug was administered alone and in combination. Nine healthy men, ages 32 to 54 years, enrolled in the study. Psychomotor performance capacities, plasma olanzapine, imipramine, desipramine concentrations, and clinical laboratory tests were measured. Pharmacokinetic variables, vital signs, subjective tests for liveliness, and psychomotor outcomes were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA. Olanzapine was safe. Sedation, postural hypotension, and minor vital sign alterations occurred during all treatments. On the liveliness questionnaire, patients generally reported poorer (less lively) scores with olanzapine alone or coadministered with imipramine versus baseline scores. These effects disappeared within 24 hours after administration. Olanzapine alone and in combination decreased motor-speed tasks (finger tapping and visual-arm random reach) compared with baseline or imipramine treatment. Peak 6-hour changes were statistically significant but clinical importance was only marginal. Olanzapine concentrations were < 19% greater than with imipramine. But olanzapine did not affect the kinetics of imipramine or desipramine and, therefore, did not show a metabolic drug interaction involving CYP2D6.",I,4

Novel antipsychotic agents introduce new pharmacological avenues that may differentially affect schizophrenic signs and symptoms, including depression.; This was a 17-country investigation of 1996 patients with schizophrenia or a related diagnosis randomly assigned to a blinded, comparative trial of the novel antipsychotic agent olanzapine (5-20 mg/d) or the conventional D2 antagonist haloperidol (5-20 mg/d). Patients were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale. The trial consisted of a 6-week and a 46-week masked responder maintenance period.; At least moderate depressive signs and symptoms (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score, > or =16) were seen in slightly more than half of this sample. Although both treatments were associated with short-term baseline-to-end point improvement on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, olanzapine-associated improvements were significantly superior to those observed with haloperidol (P=.001). Furthermore, the response rate for the group receiving olanzapine (> or =50% improvement on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale after at least 3 weeks of treatment) was also significantly higher (P=.008). Analysis demonstrated that improvement in positive, negative, and/or extrapyramidal symptoms was associated with mood improvement (indirect effect); however, most of the olanzapine treatment effect on mood was a primary direct effect (57%) that alone was significantly greater than that seen with haloperidol treatment (P<.001).; Depressive signs and symptoms in schizophrenia are responsive to treatment. The pleotrophic pharmacological features of olanzapine, through 1 or more non-D2-mediated pathways, likely contribute to its superior treatment effect. Better control of the mood disorders accompanying schizophrenia holds the possibility for improved patient outcomes.",I,I

We examined the effectiveness of treatment with clozapine on negative symptoms in a cohort of patients with minimal positive symptoms. Improvements in positive and negative symptoms were measured by BPRS ratings in a subgroup of schizophrenic patients (n=17, from a state hospital cohort of 75) with minimal positive symptoms, who had received clozapine for 6 months. In this subgroup, significant improvements were noted by a composite score on the three negative symptom items of emotional withdrawal, blunted affect, and motor retardation. Positive and depressive symptoms remained unchanged. The remaining cohort (n=58) showed improvements in overall psychopathology including positive, negative, and depressive symptoms. Interestingly, nearly 50% of each group were discharged from the hospital. These findings suggest that clozapine may be beneficial in the treatment of core negative symptoms, even in the absence of other improvements in psychopathology.

Comparative clinical trials have shown that the novel antipsychotic agent risperidone tends to have greater efficacy (i.e., clinical response defined as a > or = 20% reduction in total scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) than haloperidol in patients with chronic schizophrenia and poses less risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). We used DerSimonian and Laird's random-effects model to analyze pooled patient data from available randomized, double-masked, comparative trials of risperidone and haloperidol in patients with schizophrenia treated for at least 4 weeks at recommended doses. The purpose of the analysis was to determine whether there are significant overall differences in the rates of patient clinical response, prescription of anticholinergic agents, and treatment dropout. Six of the nine trials revealed in a literature search met all criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that in patients with chronic schizophrenia, risperidone therapy is associated with significantly higher response rates, significantly less prescribing of anticholinergic medication, and significantly lower treatment dropout rates than haloperidol.

We used guidelines issued by the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to construct a model for comparing the cost-effectiveness of risperidone and haloperidol over a 2-year period in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Use of clozapine was also included in the analysis as an alternative treatment given to patients who proved unresponsive to therapy with haloperidol or risperidone. Results are expressed in Australian dollars. Cost-effectiveness was determined by using decision-analytic modeling to compare clinical outcomes and costs. The analytic model contained a decision tree for each of the compared agents that tracked the distribution of patients between treatment outcome pathways (i.e., scenarios). Distributions were based on probabilities derived from our meta-analysis results reported elsewhere and from other sources. Each scenario had an associated monetary cost that included all significant direct costs (i.e., hospital costs; outpatient costs; and the cost of drugs, the services of health care professionals, and government-subsidized hostel accommodation). The cost for a given outcome was the sum of costs for all scenarios leading to that outcome. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as the total cost per favorable outcome. The definition of a favorable outcome was one in which the patient was in a response phase at the end of the 2-year period. The probability of a patient experiencing a favorable outcome at the end of 2 years was 78.9% for risperidone versus 58.9% for haloperidol. The total cost of treatment for 2 years was $15,549.00 for risperidone versus $18,332.00 for haloperidol. The expected cost per favorable outcome was $19,709.00 for risperidone and $31,104.00 for haloperidol. Risperidone was more cost-effective than haloperidol and therefore was ""dominant"" in pharmacoeconomic terms because it produced a higher proportion of favorable outcomes at lower cost.

At present, there are few reported comparisons of these drugs in this population. We report on a consecutive series of treatment-resistant schizophrenics given either clozapine or risperidone in open clinical trials.; Subjects were treated with clozapine (n = 57) or risperidone (n = 29). Pretreatment GAF, CGI, and PANSS scores did not differ between the groups, nor did demographic variables including age, age at first hospitalization, years ill, number of previous hospitalizations, or gender. The mean treatment trial was 12.1 weeks, with mean doses of clozapine 420 mg, and risperidone 7.75 mg. The length of the trial did not differ significantly between the groups. Response was taken to be a 20% decrease in the PANSS score.; Using repeated measures ANOVA, PANSS total scores (F = 5.3, p = 0.02) and positive subscore (F = 7.4, p = 0.008) showed greater improvement in the clozapine group than the risperidone group, while other PANSS subscores showed a trend toward greater improvement with clozapine. The PANSS-derived factors of excitement (F = 6.7, p = 0.01), psychosocial withdrawal (F = 3.8, p = 0.05), and psychomotor retardation (F = 3.9, p = 0.05) improved more in the group treated with clozapine. The GAF (F = 10.9, p = 0.0014), CGI (F = 11.5, p = 0.0011), and CGI improvement (p = 0.0001) scores also improved more in the clozapine group. Of the clozapine group, 25 (44%) responded, while 8 (28%) of the risperidone group responded to treatment.; Clozapine had better efficacy in subjects with treatment-resistant schizophrenia compared to risperidone, although risperidone appears to yield better response rates than those previously reported for typical antipsychotics. Double-blind, controlled trials of risperidone are needed to establish its efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.",7,E

As compared to the control subjects, the patients showed essentially reduced HRV parameters which were negatively correlated with the plasma clozapine levels. Therefore, clozapine's anticholinergic effect is correlated to the plasma clozapine level when measured by the decrease of HRV. We suggest that HRV data might be useful as a predictor for plasma clozapine levels.",6,E

After a 1-week dose-titration phase, doses were fixed at 6 mg/day of risperidone and 300 mg/day of clozapine for 1 week and then adjusted according to each patient's response. The final mean doses were 6.4 mg/day of risperidone and 291.2 mg/day of clozapine. Treatment efficacy and safety were evaluated with several well-known rating scales.; Both risperidone and clozapine significantly reduced the severity of psychotic symptoms (scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Clinical Global Impression scale) from baseline, with no significant between-group differences. At endpoint, 67% of the risperidone group and 65% of the clozapine group were clinically improved (reduction of 20% or more in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score). Risperidone appeared to have a faster onset of action. In both groups extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse events were few, and their severity was generally mild. Neither group showed evidence of a relation between drug plasma concentrations and clinical effectiveness.; Risperidone was well tolerated and as effective as medium doses of clozapine in patients with chronic schizophrenia who had been resistant to or intolerant of conventional neuroleptics.",I,4

Cortical 5-HT2A binding was estimated by reference to the values for 14 antipsychotic-free schizophrenic subjects with the use of positron emission tomography and [18F]setoperone, a high-affinity radioligand for cortical 5-HT2A receptors.; A dose-dependent decrease in the number of available cortical binding sites for [18F] setoperone was demonstrated in the chlorpromazine group; for the highest dose, there was a virtual lack of sites available for binding. A very low percentage of available binding sites was also observed in the clozapine-treated patients at all doses. This suggests a high level of 5-HT2A blockade with both clozapine and high doses of chlorpromazine. No significant binding of amisulpride to 5-HT2A receptors was detected.; A high level of 5-HT2A receptor blockade does not appear specific to clozapine in comparison with high doses of chlorpromazine, suggesting that the distinct clinical profiles of both drugs are unrelated to 5-HT2A blockade itself.",2,E

In a double-blind 6-week trial, 211 patients with acute exacerbation according to DSM-III-R criteria were randomly assigned to receive risperidone at 8 mg once daily or 4 mg twice daily. The primary efficacy measure was the treatment response rate, defined as a 20% or greater reduction in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores. Severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was assessed by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. The percentage of patients who showed a treatment response at endpoint was not significantly different between groups (76%, once-daily; 72%, twice-daily), nor was the median time to first treatment response (14 days, both groups). Significant reductions in PANSS total and subscale scores and PANSS-derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale were observed in both groups, with no significant between-group differences. Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale scores did not differ significantly between groups. There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms, or clinical laboratory test results in either group. Gradual dosage titration over the first 3 days of treatment was well-tolerated in both groups. The median trough plasma concentrations of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone were significantly lower with once-daily than with twice-daily administration; median plasma concentrations measured within the first 8 hours after administration tended to be higher with once-daily administration. These differences did not affect the safety and efficacy of risperidone. Risperidone given once daily at 8 mg is as effective as twice-daily administration of 4 mg in the treatment of acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. Both regimens were equally well-tolerated.",6,E

A total of 123 patients (62 RIS; 61 HAL/AMI) were included; the mean daily dosage at endpoint was 6.9 mg RIS versus 9 mg HAL combined with 180 mg AMI. Efficacy results for those 98 patients (47 RIS; 51 HAL/AMI) who completed at least 3 weeks of double-blind treatment revealed in both treatment groups large reductions in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (RIS 37%; HAL/AMI 51%) and the Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale total scores (RIS 51%; HAL/AMI 70%). The reductions in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale scores in the total group were significantly larger in the HAL/AMI group than in the RIS group (p < 0.01), mostly because of significant differences in the subgroup of patients suffering from depression with psychotic features, whereas treatment differences in the other diagnostic subgroups were not significant. The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects as assessed by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale was slightly higher under RIS (37%) than under HAL/AMI (31%). Adverse events were reported by 66% of RIS and 75% of HAL/AMI patients. The results of this trial suggest that the therapeutic effect of HAL/AMI is superior to RIS in the total group of patients with combined psychotic and depressive symptoms. However, subgroup differences have to be considered.",I,I

During a 5-week transition period, patients were randomized to treatment with sertindole or haloperidol; other treatments were gradually discontinued. Patients then received treatment through Day 365. Time to treatment failure was numerically superior in sertindole-treated patients compared with haloperidol-treated patients, although this difference was not statistically significant. Sertindole-treated patients, however, remained free of hospitalization for exacerbation of schizophrenia and remained medically compliant significantly longer than did haloperidol-treated patients. In addition, there were significantly fewer reports of EPS in sertindole-treated patients and sertindole therapy was generally well tolerated. Patients transitioned well from other antipsychotic agents to sertindole. Sertindole appears to be an effective long-term treatment for schizophrenia.",I,3

EPS, such as facial bradykinesia and akinesia, involve some of the same response systems and phenomena as emotional display channels. EPS are attributed to the blockade of dopamine receptors in the striatum by traditional neuroleptics. Newer atypical neuroleptics target primarily mesolimbic and mesocortical areas, and receptors for other transmitters such as serotonin. Olanzapine has been reported as less likely to cause EPS and may improve some negative signs. We investigated the relationship between measures of EPS and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia treated with haloperidol or olanzapine. Patients were rated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Simpson-Angus Scale EPS scale. Results show that the two agents have comparable efficacy but different safety outcomes. A positive correlation between EPS and PANSS negative score was detected in the haloperidol group only. Stepwise multiple regression analysis shows that a big proportion of variability in PANSS negative symptoms is predicted by EPS in the haloperidol group, but not in the olanzapine group, even though EPS increased in patients treated with haloperidol but not in olanzapine patients.",I,6

The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationship of patient demographic variables to therapeutic outcomes and to analyze the financial impact of risperidone on the treatment of psychotic symptoms. Subjects included in this 2-year, retrospective cohort, intent-to-treat analysis were all patients initiated on risperidone therapy at an inpatient psychiatric treatment facility. Clinical outcomes were assessed from the absolute change in hospitalized days, total number of psychotropic medications prescribed, and historic Clinical Global Impression severity scores. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to analyze the potential relationship to certain demographic variables to therapeutic response. The cost-benefit analysis compared the direct treatment costs incurred by the institution before and after risperidone initiation. Of the 66 patients originally started on risperidone, 57 completed a therapeutic trial. A clinical response was evident in 54 percent of these patients overall. Logistic regression analysis identified previous treatment intolerance and a negative history of substance abuse as predictive of therapeutic success with risperidone (p = .0006 and p = .01, respectively). Hospitalization rates declined by 43 percent among treatment responders and by 1.3 percent among nonresponders resulting in a net annual savings of $147,962. Risperidone may be efficacious in many patients who had previously failed antipsychotic trials. Patients who had been unable to tolerate traditional antipsychotics and those who lacked a documented history of substance abuse were uniquely responsive to risperidone treatment. The significant decline in hospitalized days that was observed among responsive patients seems to indicate that risperidone may be a cost-effective approach to the management of psychotic symptoms.",6,E

The number of patients in the clozapine group ranged from 383 (1.5 years of treatment) to 29 (4.5 years). The group of patients who took traditional antipsychotics was made up of all patients (N = 233) with similar diagnoses, symptom severity, and duration of illness present in Texas state hospitals on an index day.; The clozapine group showed a rapid and continuing decrease in hospital bed-days compared with controls who took traditional antipsychotics. The number of clozapine-treated patients who required little or no hospitalization during successive 6-month periods became significant (p < .0001) within 1.5 years, and continued to increase. Conversely, the number of patients taking clozapine who required virtually continuous state hospitalization decreased markedly compared with those taking traditional antipsychotics.; Potential hospital cost savings are substantial, even though overall group results are diluted by clozapine nonresponders. Most treatment costs for clozapine nonresponders were related to hospital care; most or all of such costs would have been present in any event had these patients remained on traditional antipsychotic therapy. We believe a trial of clozapine therapy provides a low-cost opportunity for a highly effective and highly cost-saving outcome in those patients who will favorably respond to this therapy.

We hypothesized that in vitro immune parameters of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are affected in the course of clozapine treatment and that clozapine per se, added in vitro to PBMC cultures of clozapine-treated patients, exerts differential effects in the timecourse of treatment in vivo. We measured proliferation and cytokine secretion of PBMC, serum autoantibodies, and immunoglobulin levels in 17 patients before and during the first 6 weeks of clozapine treatment. Independent of clozapine dosage and rectal temperature, clozapine treatment in vivo suppressed proliferation and shedding of sIL-2r by PBMC, and the addition of clozapine in vitro induced, relative to unstimulated conditions, PBMC proliferation and secretion of IL-6 and sIL-2r. Serum IgG levels were increased; whereas, autoantibody pattern was unaffected. Thus, clozapine treatment and the addition of clozapine in vitro exert differential effects on various in vitro immune parameters independent of clozapine dosage and rectal temperature in the course of treatment.",5,E

To differentiate between disease and drug-induced negative symptoms, we examined eight drug-free and eight neuroleptic-treated schizophrenic patients. Positive and negative symptoms and extrapyramidal side effects were assessed using standardized rating scales (PSAS, AMDP, SANS). 'Reaction time' and 'motor speed' were measured using a computer-aided system and striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability was assessed using [I-123]IBZM SPECT. Psychomotor reaction time, parkinsonism, affective flattening and avolition were increased in treated patients relative to the untreated cohort and were negatively correlated with dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability. Significant positive correlations were found between parkinsonism and affective flattening and between psychomotor slowing and avolition. Positive symptoms were not significantly associated with striatal IBZM binding. These findings support the hypothesis that neuroleptic-induced dopamine D2/D3 blockade in the striatum can mimic certain negative symptoms, such as affective flattening and avolition, and indicates that psychomotor testing may be helpful in differentiating between disease and drug-induced negative symptoms.",I,4

Three other subjects taking 30-40 mg/day were also included. Once steady-state plasma levels were achieved, dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors were assessed by using [11C]raclopride and [18F]setoperone positron emission tomography imaging, respectively. Ratings of clinical status, extrapyramidal side effects, and prolactin levels were also obtained.; Olanzapine induced near saturation of the 5-HT2 receptors, even at 5 mg/day. Its D2 occupancy increased with dose: patients taking 5-20 mg/day showed 43%-80% D2 occupancy, while patients taking 30-40 mg/day showed 83%-88%.; Olanzapine is a potent 5-HT2 blocker and shows a higher 5-HT2 than D2 occupancy at all doses. However, its D2 occupancy is higher than that of clozapine and similar to that of risperidone. In the usual clinical dose range of 10-20 mg/day, its occupancy varies from 71% to 80%, and this restricted range may explain its freedom from extrapyramidal side effects and prolactin elevation. However, doses of 30 mg/day and higher are associated with more than 80% D2 occupancy and may have a higher likelihood of prolactin elevation and extrapyramidal side effects.",6,E

The present study was designed to compare the effects of risperidone versus haloperidol on the ability to perceive emotion in 20 treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients, using a double-blind design. Measures of emotion perception included a facial emotion identification test (still photographs presented on videotape), a voice emotion identification test (audiotape), and an affect perception test (brief interpersonal vignettes presented on videotape). These measures were administered during the final week of baseline and after 8 weeks of double-blind medication. Risperidone treatment produced a greater effect on patients' ability to perceive emotion compared with haloperidol treatment. Additionally, all patients who received risperidone demonstrated improvement in performance between baseline and retest, compared with four of the nine patients who received haloperidol. When changes in positive symptoms were statistically controlled, the results remained significant.

The intent-to-treat analysis of mean changes from baseline in the BPRS total, BPRS Psychosis core, and CGI-S scores demonstrated that ziprasidone 160 mg/day was comparable with haloperidol in reducing overall psychopathology and positive symptoms and was superior to ziprasidone 4 mg/day. Despite the small sample size and short duration of the trial, the improvement in CGI-S with both ziprasidone 160 mg/day and haloperidol 15 mg/day was statistically significantly greater than with ziprasidone 4 mg/day (p = 0.001 andp = 0.005, respectively). The percentage of patients classified as responders on both the BPRS total (> or = 30% improvement) and CGI-Improvement (score of 1 or 2) scales in the ziprasidone 160 mg/day group was similar to that in the haloperidol group and nonsignificantly greater than that in the ziprasidone 4 mg/day group.

The aim of this study was to determine whether clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic agent with a potent serotonergic antagonistic activity, affects impulsiveness and aggression. Its effects on serum lipids, platelet-poor plasma serotonin (5-HT), and norepinephrine (NE) levels were also studied. Thirty neuroleptic-resistant chronic schizophrenic patients, maintained on clozapine for 1 year, were evaluated for aggressiveness, impulsiveness, and suicidality in comparison with 30 chronic schizophrenic patients maintained on classical antipsychotic agents for the same period of time. Clozapine treatment was associated with less impulsiveness (p < 0.05), aggressiveness (p < 0.01) and fewer suicidal attempts (p < 0.05). Serum triglycerides and plasma NE levels were significantly higher (p < 0.01 and p < 0.0001, respectively) in the patients treated with clozapine, as compared with patients treated with classical neuroleptic drugs. The authors conclude that long-term clozapine treatment may be effective in controlling aggressive, impulsive, and suicidal behavior in neuroleptic-resistant chronic schizophrenic patients. The elevated plasma NE levels in patients treated with clozapine as compared to those treated with classical neuroleptic drugs may be relevant for the anti-aggressive/antisuicidal activity of clozapine.",I,I

Both tasks required participants to identify five-digit numbers which were repeated. Numbers were presented in series for 500 ms each and separated by a 500-ms time-out period. In the immediate memory task, subjects were to respond if a number was identical to the one that had immediately preceded it. The delayed memory task differed from the first task in that a longer delay (3.5 s) between stimuli was introduced, and during this delay distracter stimuli appeared. While normal control subjects performed accurately on both tasks (exceeding 80% correct detections), schizophrenic patients performed poorly, performing worse on the delayed memory task than on the immediate memory task. Rates of commission errors (responses made to similar, but not identical numbers) were nearly equal between groups on the immediate memory task, but on the delayed memory task normal control subjects made relatively more commission errors while schizophrenic patients made fewer commission errors. No differences in response latencies were observed between subject groups or tasks. This paradigm may prove useful in discriminating subtle differences in immediate and delayed memory capability among psychiatric populations and normal control subjects.",2,E

In contrast, only one suicide occurred in six years among patients treated with clozapine who were of similar diagnosis, age, and sex, for a suicide rate of about 12.7 per 100,000 patients per year. This rate is similar to the 15.7 per 100,000 patients per year for all U.S. patients treated with clozapine, calculated from data reported as of June 1996 to the clozapine national registry system maintained by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, the U.S. manufacturer of clozapine.; The study results suggest that clozapine therapy is associated with a reduced risk of suicide among patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.",I,I

The results of these studies either found association between 5-HT2A genetic variants and clozapine response or found differences in the same direction which did not reach statistical significance. Meta-analysis of these studies including 373 patients who responded to the treatment and 360 non-responders showed association between two 5-HT2A polymorphisms, 102-T/C and His452Tyr, and clozapine response. Statistical analysis of extreme responders showed a clearer association of the 102-T/C with clozapine response.

The serotonin synthesis inhibitor dl-p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) was used to evaluate the involvement of endogenous serotonin in (a) the induction of MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion in NMRI mice, and (b) the inhibition of MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion by each of five monoaminergic antagonists (M100907, clozapine, olanzapine, raclopride, SCH23390). Further, brain monoaminergic biochemistry was characterised in rats and mice after various drug treatments. PCPA pretreatment did not significantly reduce MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion in any of the experiments performed; however in a meta-analysis of six experiments, the locomotion displayed by MK-801-treated animals was diminished 17% by PCPA pretreatment. The selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100907 exerted a dose-dependent inhibition of MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion. This effect was abolished in mice pretreated with PCPA, but could be restored in a dose-dependent manner by restitution of endogenous 5-HT by means of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). On the other hand, the inhibition of MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion exerted by the selective dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist raclopride or the dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 was unaffected by PCPA pretreatment. The antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine displayed a split profile. Hence, the inhibitory effect on MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion exerted by low doses of these compounds was diminished after PCPA pretreatment, while inhibition exerted by higher doses was unaffected by PCPA. These results suggest that (1) MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion is accompanied by an activation of, but is not fully dependent upon, brain serotonergic systems. (2) In the hypoglutamatergic state induced by MK-801, endogenous serotonin exerts a stimulatory effect on locomotion through an action at 5-HT2A receptors, an effect that is almost completely counterbalanced by a concomitant inhibitory impact on locomotion, mediated through stimulation of serotonin receptors other than 5-HT2A receptors. M100907, by blocking 5-HT2A receptors, unveils the inhibitory effect exerted on locomotion by these other serotonin receptors. (3) Dopamine D-2 receptor antagonistic properties of antipsychotic compounds, when they come into play, override 5-HT2A receptor antagonism. Possible implications for the treatment of schizophrenia with 5-HT2A receptor antagonists are discussed. It is hypothesized that treatment response to such agents is dependent on increased serotonergic tone.",4,E

The existing literature suggests fairly good efficacy of both typical and atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of psychotic disorders in children and adolescents. However, the incidence of certain side effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). is found to be higher in younger patients compared with adults. Positron emission tomography (PET) receptor studies in adults have demonstrated that the incidence of EPS is related to dose-dependent dopamine type-2 (D2) receptor occupancy and that there is a significant relationship between the number of these receptors and age.; Improved tolerability is leading to the increasing us of atypical antipsychotics for adolescent patients, though these new drugs to have specific adverse effects of their own. There is a need for more controlled studies of atypical antipsychotics in children and adolescents.

A history of substance abuse was present in 23 (38%) of the patients. At baseline evaluation, patients with a history of substance abuse had lower CGI scores and less negative symptomatology while having a higher rate of tardive dyskinesia. The overall group improved significantly over time. There were no differences in response between the substance-abusing (SA) and non-substance-abusing (NSA) patients as measured by the total BPRS, GGI and SANS ratings. The NSA group had significantly greater improvement in negative symptoms as measured by the BPRS negative symptom factor.

Without the aid of clozapine plasma concentration monitoring, 3-6 months are recommended for a therapeutic clozapine trial. Data suggest that the lag time to response can be reduced by administering a dose that produces a therapeutic clozapine concentration.; To generate a clozapine dosing nomogram to predict clozapine steady-state plasma concentrations, a cohort of 71 patients was collected via retrospective chart review and/or patient interview. Clozapine steady-state plasma concentrations and demographic variables were obtained.

However, clozapine was numerically superior to risperidone on PANSS total scores and PANSS positive, negative, excitement, and cognitive factors. Extrapyramidal side effects were minimal for clozapine, whereas some were present for risperidone. Patients taking risperidone improved significantly in the beginning stages of the study and remained stable thereafter. Patients taking clozapine showed a gradual improvement that occurred over the entire length of the trial. Neurocognitive measures showed minimal improvement and did not differentiate between the 2 medication groups.; Both clozapine and risperidone were comparably effective across a wide spectrum of psychopathologic measures. While the efficacy of clozapine was only numerically superior to that of risperidone, it was associated with fewer extrapyramidal side effects and with progressive improvement over the 12-week treatment period, suggesting that in longer trials clozapine may prove to be superior to risperidone in neuroleptic-refractory patients.",I,4

However, their safety and efficacy have not been well established in these patients.; A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled (either placebo or active drug), double-blind trials published since 1966 (N = 16; 499 treated, 112 active controls, and 123 placebo) was conducted. Data were collected on proportion of patients with clinically significant improvement, significant side effects, and dropout rates.; Pooled mean percentages of patients who improved (95% CI): all neuroleptics, 64% (54% to 74%); low potency, 63% (54% to 72%); moderate potency, 70% (56% to 85%); moderate-high potency, 62% (49% to 75%); and high potency, 69% (49% to 90%). Thus, no differences in efficacy existed between different potencies of neuroleptics. Therapeutic effect (neuroleptic minus placebo) was only 26% (14% to 38%). Treatment-emergent side effects were more common for neuroleptics vs. placebo (mean difference = 25%, 13% to 37%), but pooled mean dropout rates were not different (mean difference = 4%, -7% to 14%). Neither weighting by clinical trial quality (3 raters; weighted agreement, 83% to 92%) nor exclusion of poor quality trials changed the results.; Neuroleptics have small but significant efficacy over placebo in this population, and the efficacy rate is equivalent to the side effect rate. Comparing different neuroleptics shows they have similar efficacy, side effects, and dropout rates. Further study to determine more specific drug-responsive behaviors is needed to maximize benefits of these drugs.",I,3

Clozapine treatment was associated with an attenuation of the capacity for fine motor control. We now report that a test-retest study with 41 treatment-refractory patients confirms our earlier finding; the FC deficit is due primarily to clozapine treatment. An additional comparison was made with 10 patients who were administered the FC test repeatedly through the initial clozapine titration interval of 6-8 weeks. The results suggest that two distinct clozapine effects can be distinguished, an initial transient stage characterized by 'drowsiness' and a subsequent stage with dose-dependent emerging myoclonic features.",2,E

PEM studies are noninterventional observational cohort studies which monitor the safety of newly marketed drugs. The need for post-marketing surveillance is well recognised in the UK and general practice is an ideal source of data. PEM studies are general practitioner (community)-based and exposure is based on dispensed prescription data in England. To date, 65 PEM studies have been completed with a mean cohort size of 10 979 patients and the DSRU database has clinical information on over 700000 patients prescribed new drugs. Unlike spontaneous reporting schemes, PEM produces incidence rates for events reported during treatment. Comparative studies can be conducted for drugs in the same class. The DSRU aggregates outcome data for pregnancies exposed to new drugs. Data for children and the elderly can also be specifically examined. PEM data have a number of advantages over data from computerised general practice databases in the UK. PEM is the only technique within the UK capable of monitoring newly marketed drugs in such a comprehensive and systematic way.",5,E

This study attempted to replicate the P50 suppression deficit in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and to examine whether P50 is related to clinical symptoms or is affected by an atypical antipsychotic medication. Data from 22 recent-onset schizophrenia patients and 11 normal controls revealed that disruption in P50 suppression is present during the early stages of illness. In addition, impaired P50 suppression covaried with clinical ratings of anxiety, depression, and anergia; results also suggested that the P50 inhibitory deficit may be related to the degree of patients' attentional impairment. Finally, risperidone, compared with a typical antipsychotic medication, improved inhibition of P50 to the second click. These results support P50 suppression as a measure of disordered neurocognition in schizophrenia.",2,E

In humans, there are 5 isoenzymes involved in this process. The activity of these enzymes can be modulated by a number of commonly used drugs, yielding potentially hazardous interactions. Most of the recently introduced selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Thus, the plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants or clozapine might be elevated into toxic levels. In contrast, carbamazepine induces most of the isoenzymes. This potentiates the elimination of tricyclics and antipsychotics and might cause a serious risk for the recurrence of depressive or psychotic symptoms. Moreover, 5-10% of the population are slow metabolizers of CYP2D6. This group is prone to increased adverse effects of moderately dosed medication.

The purpose of the present study was to assess the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction between olanzapine and carbamazepine, since these agents are likely to be used concomitantly in the treatment of manic psychotic disorder.; The pharmacokinetics of two single therapeutic doses of olanzapine were determined in 11 healthy volunteers. The first dose of olanzapine (10 mg) was taken alone and the second dose (10 mg) after 2 weeks of treatment with carbamazepine (200 mg BID). Measurement of urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol excretion was used as an endogenous marker to confirm that induction of CYP3A4 by carbamazepine had occurred.; The dose of olanzapine given after a 2-week pretreatment with carbamazepine was cleared more rapidly than olanzapine given alone. Olanzapine pharmacokinetic values for Cmax and AUC were significantly lower after the second dose, the elimination half-life was significantly shorter, and the clearance and volume of distribution were significantly increased.; Carbamazepine has been shown to induce several P450 cytochromes including CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. Since CYP1A2 plays a role in the metabolic clearance of olanzapine, the interaction may be attributed to induction of CYP1A2 by carbamazepine, leading to increased first-pass and systemic metabolism of olanzapine. The interaction is not considered to be of clinical significance because olanzapine has a wide therapeutic index, and the changes in plasma concentration of olanzapine are within the fourfold variation that occurs without concern for safety in a patient population.",6,E

For several decades, pharmaceutical treatment for this disorder consisted of conventional neuroleptics such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine. However, the limitations of these drugs have driven the development of newer antipsychotics that are designed to be more efficacious and more tolerable than conventional agents. Newer agents available for consideration as first-line treatment options now include risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and, more recently, quetiapine. Proper dosing has emerged as a vital factor in the effective use of these newer drugs. This report examines data derived from clinical trials and market research with risperidone and olanzapine to help clinicians determine the appropriate dose for efficacy and to appraise the adverse events associated with that efficacious dose. Current information suggests that, for most patients with schizophrenia, the optimal dose with respect to efficacy and tolerability of risperidone is < or = 6 mg/day. The optimal dose of olanzapine is less clear and may be 15 mg/day or higher. With the advent of these newer antipsychotics, clinicians now have more treatment options for the management of patients with psychotic disorders. Knowledge gained through clinical experience is needed to augment clinical trial results and to help define the most effective use of each of these agents.",5,E

Serum creatine kinase levels > 201 IU/ml were considered abnormal. Boys had significantly higher creatine kinase activity than girls. Division of the cohort by diagnosis yielded significantly higher levels in those with schizophrenia, affective disorders and mental retardation. Higher levels were also associated with higher Clinical Global Impression score on admission, use of injections and physical restraint, and nonresponse to neuroleptic medication. There were no cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. This first large-scale investigation of serum creatine kinase activity in young psychiatric inpatients shows a significant association between high creatine kinase activity and acute psychosis, similar to that in adults. Furthermore, high creatine kinase levels on admission are predictive of the severity of the psychosis, but are not associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Because psychotic adolescents with high admission creatine kinase levels tend to be nonresponders, clinicians should consider the early use of atypical antipsychotics in this subgroup.",2,E

However, there are few guidelines available to clinicians interested in switching patients successfully treated with clozapine to olanzapine.; The goal of this study was to collect preliminary data on the safety, clinical effectiveness, and predictors of response of switching clozapine patients to olanzapine. In an open trial, 19 patients receiving clozapine were switched to olanzapine.; Eight (42%) of 19 patients were considered responders. Seven patients decompensated seriously enough to require hospitalization. All 7 of these patients were restabilized on clozapine treatment in the hospital, and olanzapine was discontinued. In an additional 4 patients, clinical status worsened, and clozapine doses were titrated upwards and olanzapine was slowly discontinued. Overall, mean total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores increased significantly from baseline to final assessment (p = .02). Responders had been treated for a significantly shorter period of time with clozapine prior to the switch compared to nonresponders (p = .04) and were receiving a lower dose of clozapine (p = .05). The final olanzapine dose did not differ between responders and nonresponders. All responders have remained on olanzapine treatment and are stable.; In this open trial, the crossover from clozapine to olanzapine was generally well tolerated and resulted in a successful transition for 8 of the 19 patients. However, mean scores on the total BPRS and negative symptom and depressive symptom subscales significantly increased. Caution must be taken in determining which patients may benefit from the switch to olanzapine because of the risk of decompensation and hospitalization. Because this was an open trial, these findings require replication in a controlled trial.",I,2

Cumulative improvement was estimated by computing the area under the improvement curve. This measure was then combined with cost data, reflecting consumption of societal resources to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.; Clozapine was significantly more effective than haloperidol on measures of symptoms (p = .02) and side effects (p < .0001), with nonsignificant trends in the positive direction on community role functioning (p = .06), family relationships (p = .23), social relationships (p = .30), and daily activities (p = .20). Clozapine was also more effective than haloperidol on the one-year cumulative Composite Health Index for Schizophrenia (p < .0001 for all weighting schemes). After converting this measure to a 0-1 Worst Health-Good Health Scale analogous to Quality Adjusted Life Years, clozapine was found to yield a small improvement of .049 Worst Health-Good Health Units as compared to an improvement of only .027 Units for haloperidol (p < .0001). Average annual costs were $2,733 lower for clozapine (95% C.I. = -$9,220 to $3,754). Although clozapine was significantly more effective than haloperidol, the summary cost-effectiveness ratio had a wide 95 percent confidence interval ranging from -$431,585 to $177,352.; Methods demonstrate an approach to using conventional disease-specific measures to evaluate the cumulative effectiveness of novel treatments for psychotic disorders and for expressing their economic effect as cost-effectiveness ratios. Among high hospital users with refractory schizophrenia, clozapine is more cost-effective than standard treatment, although the magnitude of its effect is small and there is considerable uncertainty about the cost estimates.",4,E

These data are consistent with animal studies and provide the first evidence in humans that psilocybin-induced psychosis is due to serotonin-2A receptor activation, independently of dopamine stimulation.

Although some data support the use of typical antipsychotics in pediatric patients with a variety of psychiatric syndromes, concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents often complicated their use and probably even interfered with case identification. A fundamentally new group of medications, the atypicals, have now become available and may not only have improved tolerability but also may have greater ability to reduce some target symptoms. Because of their superior side-effect profile in adults, some of these atypical treatments probably will be commonly prescribed despite a relative paucity of data about their use in the young. Moreover, although frequently prescribed in this age group, the overall prescription rate for antipsychotics will probably increase because of the putative improved safety profile of the newer agents. However, it is possible that serious side effects, such as tardive dyskinesia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, may occur with these atypical agents. For this reason, the enthusiasm for prescribing these newer treatments should be tempered with the understanding that these agents, although they may in some ways be superior to their predecessors, still possess the potential for significant adverse events. Four atypical antipsychotics are currently marketed in the United States (see Table 2). One additional agent, ziprasodone, is undergoing clinical investigation. Ziprasodone has been shown to be superior to placebo in adults suffering from schizophrenia. Ziprasodone will probably be marketed in the United States in the near future. Whether all of these atypical drugs will have a place in the clinical armamentarium of the pediatric psychopharmacologist remains to be determined. Because the receptor binding profile of the atypical agents differ, it is not possible to assume that what is true for one of these agents is true for the others. Although results from most preliminary studies with atypical antipsychotics indicate that these are promising agents for pediatric patients, further research is needed to define just how these medications may be most judiciously used.",4,E

Plasma NE levels reflect an interplay of release, reuptake, metabolism, and excretion. To explore the mechanism of clozapine-induced plasma NE elevation, we measured arterial plasma levels of NE and other catechols during intravenous infusion of tritium-labeled NE (3H-NE) in schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine, fluphenazine, or placebo. Clozapine-treated patients had markedly higher levels of NE than did the patients treated with fluphenazine or placebo. NE spillover averaged more than three times higher in clozapine-treated patients; whereas NE clearance did not differ among the groups. Production of 3H-dihydroxyphenylglycol (3H-DHPG), a purely intraneuronal metabolite of 3H-NE in clozapine-treated patients was normal, indicating that clozapine did not affect neuronal uptake of NE. Because plasma levels of DHPG and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), deaminated metabolites of catecholamines, in clozapine-treated patients were normal, clozapine also did not seem to inhibit intraneuronal monoamine oxidase (MAO). High plasma NE levels in clozapine-treated patients, therefore, resulted from increased NE spillover rather than decreased reuptake, metabolism, or clearance.",2,E

Hence, the authors examined patients with first-episode psychosis to determine the efficacy and safety of olanzapine and haloperidol treatment.; A subpopulation of first-episode patients (N=83) from a large prospective, multicenter, international, double-blind, 6-week acute treatment study was evaluated. These patients were selected from a pool of 1,996 patients who had a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder and who also met the following criteria: 1) the length of their current psychotic episode had to be 5 or fewer years, and 2) patients had to be 45 years of age or younger at onset of first psychotic symptoms.; Compared to haloperidol, olanzapine showed a statistically significantly greater reduction in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total and negative scores and in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total and positive scores. Clinical response (defined as 40% or greater improvement in BPRS total score from baseline) was also statistically significantly higher in olanzapine-treated patients (67.2%) than in haloperidol-treated patients (29.2%). Olanzapine-treated patients further showed statistically significant improvements in the Simpson-Angus scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale scores, while haloperidol-treated patients showed a worsening on both measures. Compared to olanzapine-treated multiple-episode patients in the parent study, olanzapine-treated first-episode patients achieved an even statistically significantly higher response. Haloperidol-treated first-episode patients experienced statistically significantly more extrapyramidal symptoms than haloperidol-treated multiple-episode patients.; In patients experiencing first-episode psychosis, olanzapine had a risk-benefit profile significantly superior to that of haloperidol. The study results suggest that novel antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine should be considered as a preferred option in first-episode psychosis, on the basis of both safety and efficacy advantages.",I,I

Analysis of covariance examining change at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year evaluated 1) clozapine's effect on positive and negative syndromes; 2) clozapine's effect on each syndrome, statistically controlling for the other; and 3) the interaction of clozapine treatment and the presence or absence of high levels of negative symptoms at baseline and the deficit syndrome.; Patients treated with clozapine showed significantly greater improvement than control subjects on positive symptoms at all time points and on negative symptoms at 3 months. Clozapine had no independent effect on negative symptoms at any time after control for positive symptoms, but its effects on positive symptoms persisted after control for negative symptoms at 6 weeks only. There were no significant differences in response to clozapine between patients with high and low levels of negative symptoms at baseline or between patients with and without the deficit syndrome.; The greater effectiveness of clozapine as compared to conventional medications in refractory schizophrenia is not specific to either negative clinical symptoms or clinical subtypes defined by prominent negative symptoms or evidence of the deficit syndrome.",4,E

We conducted a nonrandomized, retrospective chart review of consecutive patients identified as presenting with psychotic symptoms on inpatient wards at Riverview Hospital in British Columbia and given either risperidone or olanzapine as their first new drug after reassessment (n = 30 per treatment group). Data were collected for up to 120 days. No significant differences were observed between groups in terms of sex, age, duration of illness, or diagnosis. The mean dosage of risperidone for responders was 4.89 +/- 2.56 mg/d, whereas that for olanzapine was 17.19 +/- 3.88 mg/d. The associated daily drug-acquisition costs were significantly different, at CA$4.69 for risperidone and CA$11.52 for olanzapine. Notes in patient charts indicated that a significantly greater proportion of risperidone-treated patients (60.0%) than olanzapine-treated patients (26.7%) responded to therapy, as indicated by improvement in at least one target symptom (P < 0.01). Forty percent of patients initially treated with risperidone were discharged on their original therapy, compared with 13.3% of patients treated with olanzapine (P < 0.05). These results were not substantially affected by correction for markers of illness severity or treatment resistance. Overall, no significant differences in side effects were recorded in the patient records of the two groups. Within this cohort of patients, risperidone treatment was associated with lower drug-acquisition cost and better treatment outcomes than olanzapine.",2,E

In six patients who met the criteria of HIV-associated psychosis and who had previously developed moderate parkinsonism as a result of the use of typical neuroleptic agents, CZP was added in an open, rising dose study. Subjects were evaluated at baseline after at least 7 days without neuroleptic drugs and then monthly for 3 months of the experimental treatment using three rating scales: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and motor examination of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). A significant reduction in psychopathology as represented in the BPRS total score (54.2 at baseline versus 23.9 at month 3) and CGI (2 and 8, respectively) was obtained with a mean CZP dose of 27.08 mg/day. Parkinsonism also improved by an average of 76.5% at the end of the study. One patient did not complete the study as a result of a progressive decrease in leukocyte count while on CZP.

A hand search was performed as well. All relevant clinical data were collated by type of drug.; We found 5 blind placebo-controlled clinical trials (105 patients), 24 open-label clinical trials (387 patients), and 33 case series (115 patients) describing the use of the atypical neuroleptics clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, sulpiride, tiapride, amisulpride, remoxipride, and clothiapine in children and adolescents. Some of these agents, especially clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, were found to be efficacious in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and pervasive developmental disorders. The role of atypical neuroleptics as augmenters of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in obsessive-compulsive disorder is unclear. Risperidone appears to possess anti-tic properties in patients with Tourette's disorder.; The most convincing evidence of the efficacy of atypical neuroleptics in children and adolescents concerns clozapine in the treatment of schizophrenia. Data on other atypical neuroleptics in other disorders are still sparse, and further research is needed. Some of the atypical neuroleptics may become the first-line treatment for childhood schizophrenia and pervasive developmental disorders.",I,5

The percentage mean improvement in the haloperidol arms of the placebo-controlled studies was comparable to the percentage mean improvement in the corresponding arms of the non-placebo-controlled studies. The highest percentage responders in the placebo-groups was 43% and the lowest was 6%. Moreover the responder rates in the atypical antipsychotic and haloperidol arms of the non-placebo-controlled studies were, in two of the three studies, in the same order of magnitude as the responder rates of the placebo arms in the placebo-controlled studies. The overall dropout rates in the placebo arms was between 48% and 80% and were higher than the drop out rates in the atypical neuroleptic arms and haloperidol arms of the placebo-controlled studies. The dropout rates due to an insufficient response in the atypical neuroleptic arms and haloperidol arms of the non-placebo-controlled studies were lower when compared to corresponding treatment arms of the placebo-controlled studies.; In contrast to the mean improvement on the BPRS, responder rates in the placebo arms varied considerably from study to study. Responder rates in the atypical antipsychotic and haloperidol arms of the non-placebo-controlled studies were, in two of the three studies, of the same order of magnitude as the responder rates of the placebo arms in the placebo-controlled studies. These results indicate that placebo control is necessary. Moreover as responders are a more clinically relevant outcome measure when compared to mean improvement on a rating scale, placebo-controlled studies are still needed. However, consensus on responder definition should be agreed upon. For the moment, alternatives to placebo-controlled studies are inadequate in demonstrating efficacy in studies with schizophrenic patients.",5,E

It has been shown that the metabolism of clozapine may be affected by concomitant treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), while there have been reports of improved efficacy on negative symptomatology of clozapine in combination with SSRIs. Therefore, this prospective open clinical trial was performed to investigate the safety and tolerability of the coadministration of clozapine and paroxetine under control of serum concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites and the effect of this combination treatment on psychopathological outcome was evaluated. A total of 14 patients suffering from schizophrenia or schizodepressive disorder with predominant negative symptomatology were included. The duration of the study was at least 6 weeks for each patient. Initial treatment was a monotherapy with clozapine at a daily dose of 2.5 mg/kg weight. After two measurements of serum concentrations of clozapine and metabolites during steady state conditions, an add-on therapy with 20 mg paroxetine was initiated. No concomitant medication was allowed. The main finding of our prospective study was that addition of paroxetine to a monotherapy with clozapine was a well tolerated medication that did not give rise to new clinically relevant side effects. After addition of paroxetine the serum concentrations of clozapine and its major metabolites remained virtually constant. The results of the psychopathological measurements indicated a further clinical improvement, although the small open study could not test for efficacy.",3,E

It may arise from a variety of etiologies, including the use of antipsychotic agents, presumably because of a dopamine receptor blockade. This analysis was designed to characterize the relationship between risperidone, serum prolactin levels, and possible clinical sequelae. All data from randomized, double-blind studies of risperidone in patients with chronic schizophrenia were analyzed. The two largest studies (the North American and multinational trials) included 841 patients (259 women, 582 men) with paired prolactin level data and 1,884 patients (554 women, 1,330 men) with data on six adverse events possibly associated with increased prolactin levels (amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and decreased libido in women; erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, gynecomastia, and decreased libido in men). Both risperidone and haloperidol produced dose-related increases in plasma prolactin levels in men and women. Among women, the risperidone dose was not correlated with adverse events, nor were the adverse events correlated with endpoint prolactin levels. Among men, the incidence of adverse events was positively correlated with risperidone dose; however, at risperidone doses of 4 to 10 mg/day the incidence of adverse events was not significantly higher than that observed in patients receiving placebo. Furthermore, adverse events in men were unrelated to plasma prolactin levels. Risperidone-associated increase in serum prolactin levels was not significantly correlated to the emergence of possible prolactin-related side effects.",5,E
