AB  - Objective: Exposure to multiple traumatic events (polyvictimization) is a reliable predictor of deleterious health outcomes and risk behaviors in adolescence. The current study extends the literature on the prevalence and consequences of adolescent trauma exposure by (a) empirically identifying and characterizing trauma exposure profiles in a large, ethnically diverse, multisite, clinical sample of adolescents, and (b) evaluating relations among identified profiles with demographic characteristics and clinical correlates. Method: Data from the National Child Traumatic Stress Network Core Data Set were used to identify and characterize victimization profiles using latent class analysis in a sample of 3,485 adolescents (ages 13-18, 63% female, 35.7% White, 23.2% Black/African American, 35.0% Hispanic/Latino). Multiple measures of psychological distress and risk behaviors were evaluated as covariates of trauma exposure classes. Results: Five trauma exposure classes, or profiles, were identified. Four classes-representing approximately half the sample-were characterized by polyvictimization. Polyvictimization classes were differentiated on number of trauma types, whether emotional abuse occurred, and whether emotional abuse occurred over single or multiple developmental epochs. Unique relations with demographic characteristics and mental health outcomes were observed. Discussion: Results suggest polyvictimization is not a unidimensional phenomenon but a diverse set of trauma exposure experiences with unique correlates among youth. Further research on prevention of polyvictimization and mechanisms linking chronic trauma exposure, gender, and ethnicity to negative outcomes is warranted. © 2014 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop following traumatic brain injury (TBI), despite most patients having no conscious memory of their accident. This prospective study examined the frequency, timing of onset, symptom profile, and trajectory of PTSD and its psychiatric comorbidities during the first 4 years following moderate-to-severe TBI. Participants were 85 individuals (78.8% male) with moderate or severe TBI recruited following admission to acute rehabilitation between 2005 and 2010. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Disorders (SCID-I), participants were evaluated for pre- and post-injury PTSD soon after injury and reassessed at 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years post-injury. Over the first 4 years post-injury, 17.6% developed injury-related PTSD, none of whom had PTSD prior to injury. PTSD onset peaked between 6 and 12 months post-injury. The majority of PTSD cases (66.7%) had a delayed-onset, which for a third was preceded by subsyndromal symptoms in the first 6 months post-injury. PTSD frequency increased over the first year post-injury, remained stable during the second year, and gradually declined thereafter. The majority of subjects with PTSD experienced a chronic symptom course and all developed one or more than one comorbid psychiatric disorder, with mood, other anxiety, and substance-use disorders being the most common. Despite event-related amnesia, post-traumatic stress symptoms, including vivid re-experiencing phenomena, may develop following moderate-to-severe TBI. Onset is typically delayed and symptoms may persist for several years post-injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms from before to 2.5 years after deployment and to assess risk factors for symptom fluctuations and late-onset PTSD. METHOD: 743 soldiers deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 were assessed for PTSD symptoms using the PTSD Checklist (PCL) at 6 occasions from predeployment to 2.5 years postdeployment (study sample = 561). Predeployment vulnerabilities and deployment and postdeployment stressors were also assessed. RESULTS: Six trajectories were identified: a resilient trajectory with low symptom levels across all assessments (78.1%) and 5 trajectories showing symptom fluctuations. These included a trajectory of late onset (5.7%), independently predicted by earlier emotional problems (OR = 5.59; 95% CI, 1.57-19.89) and predeployment and postdeployment traumas (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.17 and OR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.00-1.26). Two trajectories of symptom fluctuations in the low-to-moderate range (7.5% and 4.1%); a trajectory of symptom relief during deployment, but with a drastic increase at the final assessments (2.0%); and a trajectory with mild symptom increase during deployment followed by relief at return (2.7%) were also found. Symptom fluctuation was predicted independently by predeployment risk factors (depression [OR = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.16-1.39], neuroticism [OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.21], and earlier traumas [OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16]) and deployment-related stressors (danger/injury exposure [OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04-1.40]), but not by postdeployment stressors. DISCUSSION: The results confirm earlier findings of stress response heterogeneity following military deployment and highlight the impact of predeployment, perideployment, and postdeployment risk factors in predicting PTSD symptomatology and late-onset PTSD symptoms.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the mental health of cardiac patients with diabetes and whether symptoms varied by gender and/or age. Screening for depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms was conducted on 1003 patients with cardiovascular disease. Correspondence analysis was utilized to identify clinical core profiles. Results suggested that cardiovascular disease patients with diabetes, particularly males, experience high rates of depression, suicide ideation, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Clinical implications of these findings include targeted mental health screening options as well as offering a closer look at the specific concerns of cardiovascular disease patients with diabetes. © 2015 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Purpose: To better understand alcoholism among US military veterans, we sought to examine subtypes in a nationally representative sample. Methods: We included 404 veterans with a lifetime history of AD from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS). Diagnosis of AD was made with the Mini Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MINI). We performed a latent class analysis (LCA) in Mplus utilizing the following indicator variables: MINI AD items (7), lifetime nicotine dependence (ND), lifetime drug use disorder (DUD), lifetime history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). ANOVAs were performed with class as a predictor variable for multiple outcome measures. Results: We found three classes of veterans with a history of AD, and a three class solution was a better fitting model compared to a two class model, (likelihood ratio v2 = -2316.2, mean = 16.8, s.d. = 16.9, p = 0.034). ANOVA revealed that class was a significant predictor of quality of life (F = 18.96, p < 0.001), physical health (F = 5.83, p = 0.003), mental health (F = 32.6, p = 0.000), conscientiousness (F = 23.4, p = 0.000), hostility (F = 23.4, p = 0.000), and cognitive function (F = 23.4, p < 0.001). Post-hoc pair-wise comparisons between the three classes yielded significant differences on all measures (most p's ≤ 0.006, mostly medium to large effect sizes). Class 1 (n = 42, 10.3%): The comorbidity subtype (CMB) is a highly comorbid subtype, with the highest risk of MDD and PTSD, also more likely than class 3 to have lifetime DUD or ND. Class 2 (n = 111, 27.2%): the severe and comorbid AD class (SAD) is more likely to have had all symptoms of AD (especially withdrawal and inability to quit), and is more likely than class 3 to have a lifetime DUD or ND, and past year problem drinking compared to the other two classes. They are more likely than class 3 and less likely than class 1 to have comorbid MDD or PTSD. Class 3 (n = 265, 62.5%): the non-comorbid type (NC) has less symptoms of withdrawal, less inability to quit, less overall symptoms of AD than class 1, and less likelihood of comorbid conditions than either class 1 or 2. Class 3 had greater function across multiple domains. Conclusions: Veterans have a unique profile of AD subtypes. We plan to further explore the predictive validity of these subtypes by analyzing longitudinal follow-up data for this cohort. Further study of these subtypes may help improve the treatment of alcoholism in veterans, and prevent poor outcomes.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been consistently reported as being highly comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD) and as being associated with health related functional impairment (HRF). We used archival data from 283 previously war-zone deployed Canadian veterans. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to uncover patterns of PTSD and MDD comorbidity as measured via the PTSD Checklist-Military version (PCL-M) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Individual membership of latent classes was used in a series of one-way ANOVAs to ascertain group differences related to HRF as measured via the Short-Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). LPA resulted in three discrete patterns of PTSD and MDD comorbidity which were characterized by high symptoms of PTSD and MDD, moderate symptoms, and low symptoms. All ANOVAs comparing class membership on the SF-36 subscales were statistically significant demonstrating group differences across levels of HRF. The group with the highest symptoms reported the worst HRF followed by the medium and low symptom groups. These findings are clinically relevant as they demonstrate the need for continual assessment and targeted treatment of co-occurring PTSD and MDD.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress (PTS) is common in survivors from life-threatening events. Little is known, however, about the course of PTS after life threat in the absence of collateral stressors (e.g., bereavement, social stigma, property loss) and there is a scarcity of studies about PTS in the long term. This study assessed the short- and long-term course of PTS, and the influence of gender, education and age on the level and course of PTS, in survivors from a non-fatal airliner emergency landing caused by engine failure at an altitude of 1 km. There were 129 persons on board. A survey including the Impact of Event Scale was distributed to 106 subjects after 1 month, 4 months, 14 months, and 25 months, and to 95 subjects after 19 years (response rates 64-83%). There were initially high levels of PTS. The majority of changes in PTS occurred from 1 to 4 months after the event. There were small changes from 4 to 25 months but further decrease in PTS thereafter. Female gender was associated with higher levels of PTS whereas gender was unrelated to the slope of the short- and long-term trajectories. Higher education was related to a quicker recovery although not to initial or long-term PTS. Age was not associated with PTS. The present findings suggest that a life-threatening experience without collateral stressors may produce high levels of acute posttraumatic stress, yet with a benign prognosis. The findings further implicate that gender is unrelated to trajectories of recovery in the context of highly similar exposure and few collateral stressors.

We assessed types of SLEs experienced, degree to which participants reported PTG, and variables predicting PTG across 24 months among a sample of high-risk, ethnically diverse, early emerging adults. Participants were recruited from alternative high schools (n = 564; mean age = 16.8; 65% Hispanic). Multi-level regression models were constructed to examine the impact of environmental (SLE quantity, severity) and personal factors (hedonic ability, perceived stress, developmental stage, future time orientation) on a composite score of PTG. The majority of participants reported that positive changes resulted from their most life-altering SLE of the past two years. Predictors of PTG included fewer SLEs, less general stress, having a future time perspective, and greater identification with the developmental stage of emerging adulthood. Findings suggest intervention targets to foster positive adaptation among early emerging adults who experience frequent SLEs.

AB  - PURPOSE: While many studies on mood disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following childbirth have been conducted, little is known regarding posttraumatic growth (PTG) and disordered eating in the postpartum period. This study aims to (a) identify the typology of women following childbirth based on anxiety, depressive, PTSD symptoms and level of PTG and (b) evaluate whether these profiles differ on disordered eating symptoms. METHODS: Up to 2 years after childbirth, 306 French-speaking mothers [mean age (SD) = 29.4 (4.6) years] completed questionnaires assessing PTSD, depressive, anxiety and disordered-eating symptoms and level of posttraumatic growth. RESULTS: Four profiles were highlighted: a first one labeled growing cluster (22.2 % of the sample, n = 68), a second one labeled low level of symptoms cluster (37.6 % of the sample, n = 115), a third one labeled vulnerable cluster (21.6 % of the sample, n = 66) and a last one labeled anxious-depressed-traumatized cluster (18.6 % of the sample, n = 57). Our findings also highlight an impact of these profiles on disordered eating symptoms, suggesting that disordered eating in postpartum would not be the result of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Consistent with our expectation, our findings suggest a potential protective role of posttraumatic growth on the development of disordered eating symptoms. Further researches focusing on traumatic experience, disordered eating and posttraumatic growth in postpartum are warranted.

AB  - Introduction: The aims were to identify latent classes of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a national sample of adolescents and test their associations with PTSD and functional impairment 1 year later. Method: A total of 1119 trauma-exposed adolescents ages 12 to 17 (mean = 14.99, 51% female) participating in the National Survey of Adolescents- Replication were included in this study. Telephone interviews were conducted to assess PTSD symptoms and functional impairment at Waves 1 and 2. Results: Latent class analysis revealed 3 classes of adolescent PTSD at each time point: pervasive disturbance, intermediate disturbance, and no disturbance. Three numbing and 2 hyperarousal symptoms best distinguished the pervasive and intermediate disturbance classes atWave 1. Three reexperiencing, 1 avoidance, and 1 hyperarousal symptom best distinguished these classes at Wave 2. The Wave 1 intermediate disturbance class was less likely to have a PTSD diagnosis, belong to theWave 2 pervasive disturbance class, and report functional impairment 1 year later compared with theWave 1 pervasive disturbance class. The Wave 1 no disturbance class was less likely to have PTSD, belong to the pervasive disturbance class, and report functional impairment at Wave 2. Conclusions: This study suggests that PTSD severity-distinguishing symptoms change substantially in adolescence and are not characterized by the numbing cluster, contrary to studies on adult samples. These results may help to explain inconsistent factor analytic findings on the structure and diagnosis of PTSD and emphasize that developmental context is critical to consider in both research and clinical work on PTSD assessment and diagnosis. Public Health Relevance: Accurate and developmentally sensitive characterization of PTSD symptoms and their associations with clinically relevant longitudinal outcomes is critical for effective assessment, prevention, and treatment of the disorder in trauma-exposed youth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the taxonomy of combat-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) based on symptom patterns. PARTICIPANTS: Up to 1341 military personnel who experienced a combat-related mTBI within 2 years of evaluation. MEASURES: Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory and PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). RESULTS: Cluster analysis revealed the following 4 subtypes: primarily psychiatric (posttraumatic stress disorder) group, a cognitive group, a mixed symptom group, and a good recovery group. The posttraumatic stress disorder cluster (21.9% of the sample) reported symptoms related to hyperarousal and dissociation/depression with few complaints related to cognition or headaches. The cognitive group (21.5% of the sample) had primarily cognitive and headache complaints with few mood symptoms. The mixed profile cluster included 18.6% of the sample and was characterized by a combination of mood complaints (hyperarousal and dissociation/depression), cognitive complaints, and headaches. The largest cluster (37.8% of the sample) had an overall low symptom profile and was labeled the "good recovery" group. CONCLUSIONS: The results support a unique taxonomy for combat-related mTBI. The clinical differences among these subtypes indicate a need for unique treatment resources and programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To develop latent classes of exposure to traumatic experiences before the age of 13 years in an urban community sample and to use these latent classes to predict the development of negative behavioral outcomes in adolescence and young adulthood. METHOD: A total of 1815 participants in an epidemiologically based, randomized field trial as children completed comprehensive psychiatric assessments as young adults. Reported experiences of nine traumatic experiences before age 13 years were used in a latent class analysis to create latent profiles of traumatic experiences. Latent classes were used to predict psychiatric outcomes at age 13 years, criminal convictions, physical health problems and traumatic experiences reported in young adulthood. RESULTS: Three latent classes of childhood traumatic experiences were supported by the data. One class (8% of sample), primarily female, was characterized by experiences of sexual assault and reported significantly higher rates of a range of psychiatric outcomes by young adulthood. Another class (8%), primarily male, was characterized by experiences of violence exposure and reported higher levels of antisocial personality disorder and post-traumatic stress. The final class (84%) reported low levels of childhood traumatic experiences. Parental psychopathology was related to membership in the sexual assault group. CONCLUSIONS: Classes of childhood traumatic experiences predict specific psychiatric and behavioral outcomes in adolescence and young adulthood. The long-term adverse effects of childhood traumas are primarily concentrated in victims of sexual and non-sexual violence. Gender emerged as a key covariate in the classes of trauma exposure and outcomes.

AB  - Background: Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have a worse prognosis than individuals with BPD alone. A common view is that the emotional instability and impulsivity of BPD should be treated before attempting to address trauma. However, PTSD symptoms may interfere with patients' ability to benefit from such 'stabilizing' treatments. Methods: The effect of BPD-PTSD comorbidity on self-harm and BPD symptom outcomes was evaluated in 89 patients receiving dialectical behaviour therapy, using multilevel modelling. Results: Patients with comorbid BPD-PTSD showed a trend towards elevated BPD symptoms throughout the treatment year (beta = 2.12, 95% CI =-0.21-4.44, p = 0.07). There was a three-way interaction between PTSD comorbidity, treatment completion and time, whereby PTSD comorbidity was associated with less reduction in self-harm frequency over time, but only in those completing the full 12 months of treatment (incident risk ratio = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.04-1.30, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Patients with comorbid PTSD had a poorer outcome from dialectical behaviour therapy than those with BPD alone, possibly because of the negative impact of unaddressed trauma. The results provide further grounds for recently developed treatments targeting BPD traits and PTSD symptoms simultaneously.

AB  - The present study uses longitudinal data to investigate whether differences in exposure to community violence discriminate among serious juvenile offenders in terms of mental health symptomatology for depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and hostility. Group-based modeling and moderation analyses are used to assess the influence of exposure to violence on mental health outcomes. The results demonstrate a moderating effect of psychosocial maturity and social support between exposure to community violence and adverse mental health consequences for youth on the stable low exposure trajectory. In addition, youth who experience stable high exposure to violence consistently suffer worse outcomes. The study contributes to the development of empirically derived profiles of serious youth offenders. While all of the youth in this study may face the stigma of being labeled as dangerous, some (particularly those on the chronic exposure trajectory) might find themselves in a situation where their psychological status exacerbates an already tenuous situation: reentry. Therefore, reentry services should better target the specific needs of this returning subgroup of serious youth offenders. © 2014 International Association for Correctional and Forensic Psychology

AB  - Objectives. The study examined the long-term course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by analyzing rates of recurrence and the predictive value of comorbid psychiatric disorders and psychosocial functioning. Methods. This study is based on diagnostic assessments administered at intake and subsequent follow-up interviews over a period of 15 years in a sample of 90 anxiety-disordered patients with comorbid PTSD who participated in the Harvard Brown Anxiety Research project (HARP). KaplanMeier life table analysis revealed a 0.20 probability of full remission during the 15 years of follow-up. Results. Latent growth model (LGM) analysis revealed that the number of trauma exposures was a predictor of a worse course of PTSD but only during some intervals of the 15-year follow-up. Subjects with full social phobia were more likely to experience worsening of PTSD over time in comparison with subjects with less severe social phobia. Role functioning in the areas of household and employment was a significant predictor of a declining course of PTSD. Conclusions. These findings revealed the dynamic nature of the predictive value of traumatic experiences, the deleterious effect of social phobia and the long term effect of psychosocial functioning on the course of PTSD. Implications for treatment planning and development of interventions for PTSD are discussed. (copyright) 2013 Informa Healthcare.

AB  - In this study, we tested the validity of a dissociative subtype in a sample of 225 detained adolescents (142 boys, 83 girls) likely meeting full or partial criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Competing theories of dissociation pose controversy regarding dissociation as a taxon versus a continuum, and results of the current study contribute to this debate by providing evidence of distinct group differences between those high and low in dissociation. Mixture modeling revealed 2 groups of youth with differing levels of depersonalization/derealization dissociative symptoms. Differences between the 2 groups of youth were investigated regarding trauma exposure and several posttraumatic reactions: posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), emotion dysregulation, and emotional numbing. Compared with youth classified in the low-dissociation group, youth who exhibited high levels of dissociation demonstrated higher levels of total PTSS, posttraumatic symptom clusters of emotional numbing, intrusion, and associated features, as well as reporting more difficulties with emotion dysregulation. To test theory regarding the factors that increase the likelihood of persistent dissociation, bootstrapped regression analyses were performed to examine the possibility of an indirect effect of peritraumatic dissociation. Results consistent with statistical mediation suggested that the presence of peritraumatic dissociation at the time of trauma may contribute to the continuation of dissociative symptoms as a more generalized pattern. The results of the current study have implications for clinical treatment with traumatized youth.

AB  - OBJECTIVES:: To examine the effects of combat stress reaction (CSR) and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) on the level and trajectories of self-rated health (SRH) over 20 years after war exposure. METHODS:: A total of 675 veterans comprising two groups, a CSR group (n = 369) and a matched control group without CSR (n = 306), were assessed in a prospective longitudinal design, 1, 2, 3, and 20 years after their participation in the 1982 Lebanon War. SRH and PTS were assessed repeatedly, at each point of measurement. RESULTS:: The CSR participants showed more impaired initial SRH than the controls. Although the CSR group showed an improvement in SRH over time, its SRH level remained lower than that of the control group in all 4 points in time. Initial levels of PTS were associated with more impaired SRH and lower improvement over time. In addition, increased levels of PTS in the first follow-up period were related to poorer SRH, in comparison to the predicted trajectory on the basis of CSR and initial PTS. CONCLUSIONS:: Stress reaction to war trauma affected the trajectory of SRH over a 20-year period. Although the differences between veterans who had shown acute stress reaction and those who had not persisted over the entire period, there was slow improvement in SRH over time among the more impaired CSR group. PTS in the first years after the war slowed this improvement and thus played a key role in the relationship between war trauma and physical health.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess women's risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and of experiencing post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) over 4 years after seeking an abortion, and to assess whether symptoms are attributed to the pregnancy, abortion or birth, or other events in women's lives. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal cohort study which followed women from approximately 1 week after receiving or being denied an abortion (baseline), then every 6 months for 4 years (9 interview waves). SETTING: 30 abortion facilities located throughout the USA. PARTICIPANTS: Among 956 women presenting for abortion care, some of whom received an abortion and some of whom were denied due to advanced gestational age; 863 women are included in the longitudinal analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PTSS and PTSD risk were measured using the Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD). Index pregnancy-related PTSS was measured by coding the event(s) described by women as the cause of their symptoms. ANALYSES: We used unadjusted and adjusted logistic mixed-effects regression analyses to assess whether PTSS, PTSD risk and pregnancy-related PTSS trajectories of women obtaining abortions differed from those who were denied one. RESULTS: At baseline, 39% of participants reported any PTSS and 16% reported three or more symptoms. Among women with symptoms 1-week post-abortion seeking (n=338), 30% said their symptoms were due to experiences of sexual, physical or emotional abuse or violence; 20% attributed their symptoms to non-violent relationship issues; and 19% said they were due to the index pregnancy. Baseline levels of PTSS, PTSD risk and pregnancy-related PTSS outcomes did not differ significantly between women who received and women who were denied an abortion. PTSS, PTSD risk and pregnancy-related PTSS declined over time for all study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Women who received an abortion were at no higher risk of PTSD than women denied an abortion.

AB  - Large cohort studies suggest that most military personnel experience minimal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following warzone deployment, an outcome often labeled resilience. Very low symptom levels, however, may be a marker for low exposure, not resilience, which requires relatively high-magnitude or high-frequency stress exposure as a precondition. We used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to examine the longitudinal course of lifetime PTSD symptoms following combat exposure by disaggregating deployed U.S. Marines into upper, middle, and lower tertiles of combat exposure. All factor models fit the data well; Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and comparative fit index (CFI) values ranged from .91 to .97. Three distinct trajectories best explained the data within each tertile. The upper tertile comprised True Resilience (73.2%), New-Onset Symptoms (18.3%), and Pre-existing Symptoms (8.5%) trajectories. The middle tertile also comprised True Resilience (74.5%), New-Onset Symptoms (16.1%), and Pre-existing Symptoms (9.4%) trajectories. The lower tertile comprised Artifactual Resilience (86.3%), Pre-existing Symptoms (7.6%), and New-Onset Symptoms (6.1%) trajectories. True Resilience involved a clinically significant symptom increase followed by a return to baseline, whereas Artifactual Resilience involved consistently low symptoms. Conflating artifactual and true resilience may inaccurately create the expectation of persistently low symptoms regardless of warzone exposure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine trajectories of psychological functioning using latent class analysis on a sample of hospitalized survivors of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong. DESIGN: A longitudinal study of 997 survivors, recruited from among 1,331 individuals hospitalized for SARS, were interviewed at 6, 12, and 18 months after hospitalization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Psychological and physical functioning at each time point was measured using the 12-item Medical Outcome Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). RESULTS: Four latent classes were identified--chronic dysfunction, delayed dysfunction, recovery, and resilience. All groups had better physical health than the chronic group. Resilient and recovered individuals had greater social support and less SARS-related worry, and resilient individuals were more likely to be male. The resilient group also had greater social support than the delayed group and better physical functioning than the recovered group. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that longitudinal outcome trajectories following a major health-threat event in an Asian sample bear close resemblance to prototypical trajectories observed in trauma studies using Western samples. Unique predictors of the trajectories included factors observed in previous studies, such as social support, as well as factors of particular relevance to a major disease outbreak, such as SARS-related worry.

AB  - Purpose/Objective: To investigate longitudinal trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms following spinal cord injury (SCI) as well as the predictors of those trajectories. Research Method/Design: A longitudinal study of 233 participants assessed at 4 time points: within 6 weeks, 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years from the point of injury. Data were analyzed using latent growth mixture modeling to determine the best-fitting model of depression and anxiety trajectories. Covariates assessed during hospitalization were explored as predictors of the trajectories. Results: Analyses for depression and anxiety symptoms revealed 3 similar latent classes: a resilient pattern of stable low symptoms, a pattern of high symptoms followed by improvement (recovery), and delayed symptom elevations. A chronic high depression pattern also emerged but not a chronic high anxiety pattern. Analyses of predictors indicated that compared with other groups, resilient patients had fewer SCI-related quality of life problems, more challenge appraisals and fewer threat appraisals, greater acceptance and fighting spirit, and less coping through social reliance and behavioral disengagement. Conclusion/Implications: Overall, the majority of SCI patients demonstrated considerable psychological resilience. Models for depression and anxiety evidenced a pattern of elevated symptoms followed by improvement and a pattern of delayed symptoms. Chronic high depression was also observed but not chronic high anxiety. Analyses of predictors were consistent with the hypothesis that resilient individuals view major stressors as challenges to be accepted and met with active coping efforts. These results are comparable to other recent studies of major health stressors. © 2012 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Background: Most previous attempts to determine the psychological cost of military deployment have been limited by reliance on convenience samples, lack of pre-deployment data or confidentiality and cross-sectional designs. Aims: This study addressed these limitations using a population-based, prospective cohort of US military personnel deployed in support of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Method: The sample consisted of US military service members in all branches including active duty, reserve and national guard who deployed once (n = 3393) or multiple times (n = 4394). Self-reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress were obtained prior to deployment and at two follow-ups spaced 3 years apart. Data were examined for longitudinal trajectories using latent growth mixture modelling. Results: Each analysis revealed remarkably similar post-traumatic stress trajectories across time. The most common pattern was low-stable post-traumatic stress or resilience (83.1% single deployers, 84.9% multiple deployers), moderate-improving (8.0%, 8.5%), then worsening-chronic post-traumatic stress (6.7%, 4.5%), high-stable (2.2% single deployers only) and high-improving (2.2% multiple deployers only). Covariates associated with each trajectory were identified. Conclusions: The final models exhibited similar types of trajectories for single and multiple deployers; most notably, the stable trajectory of low post-traumatic stress pre- to post-deployment, or resilience, was exceptionally high. Several factors predicting trajectories were identified, which we hope will assist in future research aimed at decreasing the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder among deployers.

Method: Based on a prospective study of New York City adults following the World Trade Center disaster (WTCD), we conducted baseline interviews with 2,368 persons one year after this event and then at follow-up 1 year later to evaluate changes in current PTSD status based on DSM-IV criteria. Results: Baseline analysis suggested that current PTSD, defined as present if this occurred in the past 12 months, was associated with females, younger adults, those with lower self-esteem, lower social support, higher WTCD exposure, more lifetime traumatic events, and those with a history of pre-WTCD depression. At follow-up, current PTSD was associated with Latinos, non-native born persons, those with lower self-esteem, more negative life events, more lifetime traumatic events, and those with mixed handedness. Classifying respondents at follow-up into resilient (no PTSD time 1 or 2), remitted (PTSD time 1, not 2), delayed (no PTSD time 1, but PTSD time 2), and persistent (PTSD both time 1 and 2) PTSD, revealed the following: compared to resilient cases, remitted ones were more likely to be female, have more negative life events, have greater lifetime traumatic events, and have pre-WTCD depression. Delayed cases were more likely to be Latino, be non-native born, have lower self-esteem, have more negative life events, have greater lifetime traumas, and have mixed handedness. Persistent cases had a similar profile as delayed, but were the only cases associated with greater WTCD exposures. They were also likely to have had a pre-WTCD depression diagnosis. Examination of WTCD-related PTSD at follow-up, more specifically, revealed a similar risk profile, except that handedness was no longer significant and WTCD exposure was now significant for both remitted and persistent cases. Conclusion: PTSD onset and course is complex and appears to be related to trauma exposure, individual predispositions, and external factors not directly related to the original traumatic event. This diagnostic classification may benefit from additional conceptualization and research as this relates to changes in PTSD status over time. (copyright) Springer-Verlag 2009.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to chart patterns of simultaneous trajectories over 8 months in breast cancer survivors’ (BCS) supportive care needs, psychological distress, social support, and posttraumatic growth. Clusters of BCS among these trajectories were identified and characterized. Methods: Of 426 BCS study participants, 277 (65 %) provided full assessments in the last week of primary cancer treatment and 4 and 8 months later. Latent trajectories were obtained using growth mixture modeling for patients who responded to all scores for at least one time point (n = 348). Then, classification of BCS was performed by hierarchical agglomerative clustering on axes derived from a multiple factor analysis of trajectory assignments. Self-esteem, attachment security, and satisfaction with care were assessed at baseline. Results: Four trajectory clusters were identified, including two BCS subgroups (63 %) with low needs and low psychological distress. Two others (37 %) exhibited high or increasing needs and concerning levels of psychological distress. These latter clusters were characterized by higher insecure attachment, lower satisfaction with care, and either lower education or younger age, and having undergone chemotherapy. Conclusion: More than a third of BCS present unfavorable patterns in supportive care needs over 8 months after primary cancer treatment. Identified psychosocial and cancer care characteristics point to targets for enhanced BCS supportive care.

AB  - Background Post-traumatic symptomatology is one of the signature effects of the pernicious exposures endured by responders to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster of 11 September 2001 (9/11), but the long-term extent of diagnosed Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its impact on quality of life are unknown. This study examines the extent of DSM-IV PTSD 11-13 years after the disaster in WTC responders, its symptom profiles and trajectories, and associations of active, remitted and partial PTSD with exposures, physical health and psychosocial well-being. Method Master's-level psychologists administered sections of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Range of Impaired Functioning Tool to 3231 responders monitored at the Stony Brook University World Trade Center Health Program. The PTSD Checklist (PCL) and current medical symptoms were obtained at each visit. Results In all, 9.7% had current, 7.9% remitted, and 5.9% partial WTC-PTSD. Among those with active PTSD, avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms were most commonly, and flashbacks least commonly, reported. Trajectories of symptom severity across monitoring visits showed a modestly increasing slope for active and decelerating slope for remitted PTSD. WTC exposures, especially death and human remains, were strongly associated with PTSD. After adjusting for exposure and critical risk factors, including hazardous drinking and co-morbid depression, PTSD was strongly associated with health and well-being, especially dissatisfaction with life. Conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate the extent and correlates of long-term DSM-IV PTSD among responders. Although most proved resilient, there remains a sizable subgroup in need of continued treatment in the second decade after 9/11. © Cambridge University Press 2015.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic injuries affect millions of patients each year, and resulting post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) significantly contributes to subsequent impairment. AIMS: To map the distinctive long-term trajectories of PTSD responses over 6 years by using latent growth mixture modelling. METHOD: Randomly selected injury patients (n = 1084) admitted to four hospitals around Australia were assessed in hospital, and at 3, 12, 24 and 72 months. Lifetime psychiatric history and current PTSD severity and funxctioning were assessed. RESULTS: Five trajectories of PTSD response were noted across the 6 years: (a) chronic (4%), (b) recovery (6%), (c) worsening/recovery (8%), (d) worsening (10%) and (e) resilient (73%). A poorer trajectory was predicted by female gender, recent life stressors, presence of mild traumatic brain injury and admission to intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the long-term PTSD effects that can occur following traumatic injury. The different trajectories highlight that monitoring a subset of patients over time is probably a more accurate means of identifying PTSD rather than relying on factors that can be assessed during hospital admission.

AB  - The present study examined individual latent changes in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms over a 60-month period after an industrial disaster. Participants were recruited from survivors of a factory explosion. Participants were assessed retrospectively for peritraumatic reactions and acute stress symptoms. Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were then assessed at 6, 15, and 60 months. Using structural equation modeling, the authors tested 3 hypotheses of individual latent change: stability of PTSD symptoms between 6, 15, and 60 months; change between 6 and 15 months; and change between 15 and 60 months. Only one model provided a good fit suggesting that PTSD symptoms evolved between 6 and 15 months after trauma exposure and remained stable at the individual level thereafter.

AB  - Objective: Prospectively identifying individuals at heightened risk for depression can alleviate the disease burden of distal physical and mental health consequences after cancer onset. Our objective was to identify heterogeneous trajectories of adjustment in cancer patients, using treatment-type as a predictor. Methods: Participants were followed for 6 years within the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a prospective population-based cohort study. The sample consisted of 1,294 middle-aged participants who were assessed once before and 3 time points after their report of an initial cancer diagnosis. In addition to self-reported depressive symptoms, subjects indicated receipt of surgical, radiological, or chemical interventions as part of their usual oncological care. Results: Four symptom trajectories were identified with Latent Growth Mixture Modeling: an increasing depression (10.5%), chronic depression (8.0%), depressed-improved (7.8%), and stable-low depression (73.7%). A conditional model using participants with available predictor data (n = 545) showed individuals in the emerging depression class were significantly more likely to have received chemo/medication therapy when compared with the remitting depression, stable-low, and chronic depression classes. Participants in the chronic and depressed-improved classes generally had worse baseline health, and the depressedimproved were also younger in age. Conclusion: Patients who exhibited increasing depressive symptoms had a greater probability of receiving chemo/medication therapy than any other adjustment trajectory group, although the majority of chemotherapy patients did not exhibit depressive symptom changes. These data underscore the diversity of ways that patients adjust to cancer, and suggest cancer treatment, baseline health, and age may influence long-term patterns of psychological adjustment. © 2014 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Background: The burden of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in the military is well documented and co-occurring alcohol misuse is common, but few studies have documented longitudinal trajectories of these disorders, and none have considered how co-occurring alcohol misuse modifies these trajectories. The primary aim of the OHARNG-MHI is to examine the role of pre-, peri-, and post-deployment experiences, both military and civilian, in jointly contributing to trajectories of psychopathology, psychological adjustment, and resilience. This particular analysis identifies vulnerable subgroups by studying trajectories of depression and PTSD symptoms after deployment across four waves. Methods: Among 3457 subjects enrolled into Waves 1-4 from 2008-2012, a cohort of 1199 were identified as having completed at least two study waves, being deployed within two years of baseline, and having experienced a traumatic event. All subjects with depression, with or without PTSD (n=727), completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); those who also had co-occurring PTSD completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL). Subjects with PTSD (n=472) completed both the PHQ-9 and the PCL using the same traumatic event defined as their worst of all study waves. Time-stable risk factors at baseline (area of conflict to which the soldier was deployed in their most recent deployment, low education/income, childhood adversity, marital status, 10+lifetime traumas, 4+lifetime stressful events) and time-varying covariates (past-year alcohol misuse, past-year PTSD, past-year depression, and cumulative traumas and stressors) were used to identify membership into different latent trajectory groups and to assess the effect of alcohol misuse on observed trajectories. Using the PHQ-9, depression symptoms were modeled assuming a zero-inflated Poisson distribution in the 727 soldiers. PTSD symptoms were modeled assuming a censored normal distribution using the PTSD Check List symptom scale in 472 soldiers and were questioned about the same worst index event throughout all follow-up interviews. Alcohol misuse was defined as having either past-year abuse or dependence defined by the DSM-IV. SAS-callable proc traj was used to estimate output trajectories. PTSD diagnosis at each time point was used as a time-varying covariate to see if it significantly altered outcome, and conversely, depression at each time point was used as a covariate in the PTSD trajectories. Results: Following combat trauma and after the follow-up period, 46% of soldiers were resistant to the development of PTSD symptoms, 38% experienced mild PTSD symptoms that remitted, 11% mild chronic PTSD symptoms, and 5% chronic moderately severe PTSD. Vulnerable subgroups were identifiable at baseline as low income, low education, and high number of lifetime traumatic events. 55% of soldiers were resistant to the development of depressive symptoms, 20% experienced remitting mild depression symptoms, 13% displayed delayed onset of two symptoms of depression, and 12% showed chronic dysfunction. Trajectories of Depression: Baseline lifetime stressors predicted chronic dysfunction three-fold. The absence of childhood trauma, not being married/being single, not being deployed to a conflict area, and having few lifetime stressors were associated with resistance to the development of depressive symptoms. Whereas the addition of alcohol abuse or dependence had no effect on the 55% who were resistant to depression symptoms across all four waves, all other subgroups misusing alcohol experienced a worsening of depressive symptoms. Of the 727, the 13% who were resistant at month 7 and only worsened minimally over the 45 months were particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of alcohol misuse, which resulted in a 180% increase in depression symptoms across the four waves; the two remaining trajectory groups showed moderate increases in symptomology. Trajectories of PTSD: A high level of potentially traumatic events at baseline made soldiers nearly 12 times more likely to fall into the chronic dysfunction group. Being deployed to an area of conflict was associated with constant mild symptoms. Of the 472, 46% experienced no PTSD symptoms at month 7 and went on to be completely resistant to the development of PTSD symptoms at all four time points. 38% had mild subsyndromal symptoms that gradually remitted over 45 weeks, 11% who had persistent constant mild symptoms of PTSD continued to do so, and 5% who had severe chronic symptoms worsened over time. The impact of those misusing alcohol was compared to those not misusing alcohol. The addition of alcohol misuse mildly worsened subjects in all four groups, with the largest effect being a 9. Conclusions: Most soldiers fell into the low-symptoms groups and were resistant to both PTSD and depression. The primary predictors of chronic dysfunction were low income, low education, and a high number of lifetime traumas and stressors. The potential influence of lifetime risk factors on trajectories suggests that a life course perspective (including pre-, peri-, postdeployment inquiry) is critical in the investigation of psychopathology in service members.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are highly comorbid in association with serious clinical consequences. Nevertheless, to date, no study using latent class or latent profile analysis (LCA/LPA) has examined patterns of co-occurring PTSD and depression symptoms among natural disaster survivors, nor has the distinctiveness of DSM-5 PTSD and depression symptoms been clarified in the aftermath of trauma. This study was primarily aimed at filling these gaps. METHODS: LPA was used to examine self-reported PTSD and depression symptoms in an epidemiological sample of 1196 Chinese earthquake survivors. RESULTS: A 4-class solution characterized by low symptoms (53.9%), predominantly depression (18.2%), predominantly PTSD (18.9%) and combined PTSD-depression (9.0%) patterns fit the data best. Demographic characteristics and earthquake-related exposures were specifically or consistently associated with the non-parallel profiles varying in physical health impairment. LIMITATIONS: A sample exposed to specific traumatic events was assessed by self-report measures. CONCLUSIONS: The distinctiveness of DSM-5 PTSD and depression symptoms following an earthquake suggests that PTSD and depression may be independent sequelae of psychological trauma rather than a manifestation of a single form of psychopathology. The current findings support the distinction between PTSD and depression constructs, and highlight the need for identifications of natural disaster survivors at high risk for PTSD and/or depression, and interventions individually tailored to one's symptom presentations.

AB  - Context The detailed course of recovery following compensable whiplash associated disorders (WAD) is not well understood. Some people recover within months and others report symptoms for extended periods. Recent research identified distinct recovery pathways. Identifying recovery pathways for people with this condition in compensable settings could assist clinical and claim management. Study objective This study aimed to identify recovery trajectories based on disability, pain catastrophising and mental health and, secondly, to examine developmental linkages between the trajectories. Study design A cohort of 246 people with compensable WAD were followed for 24 months after a motor vehicle related injury. Outcome measures Functional Rating Index (FRI), Pain Catastrophising Scale (PCS) and the SF36 Mental Component Score (SF 36 MCS). Method Group-based trajectory analytical techniques were used to identify distinct post-injury profiles. Multinominal logistic regression modelling identified factors associated with membership of different trajectories. Results 246 people were enrolled a median of 72 days after injury. Three trajectories were identified for the measures used and their prevalences, respectively, were: for disability (FRI) they were mild (47%), moderate (31%), and severe (22%); for pain catastrophising (PCS) they were non-catastrophisers (55%), moderate-low catastrophisers (32%) and clinically significant catastrophisers (13%); and, for mental health (SF36 MCS) they were good mental health (40%), moderately low mental health (42%) and severely low mental health (18%). All groups showed no further recovery beyond 12 months after injury. The significant baseline predictors of the severe disability trajectory were: lower (that means worse) bodily pain scores (SF 36 BPS) (p ≤ 0.01); high pain catastrophising (p ≤ 0.01); and, self-reported fair or poor general health (p = 0.03). Conditional probabilities for group membership showed that the three trajectories for both PCS and FRI were linked. Dual membership was high for the mild disability and mild pain catastrophising trajectories and, for the severe disability and clinically significant pain catastrophising trajectories. Conclusions There is a strong and plausible association between severe disability, clinical levels of pain catastrophising and low mental health. Claimants can be identified at claim notification based on three estimated recovery trajectories. Claim and clinical interventions can be targeted to the profile within each recovery trajectory. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - While post-trauma research has focused on psychiatric disorders, mainly posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic events may have broader mental health effects that result in dysfunction at home, work and social settings. We know little about dysfunction trajectories, or the relation between posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and dysfunction. We selected a random sample of adults in Galveston and Chambers Counties, Texas, 2-6 months after Hurricane Ike and interviewed them 3 times in 2 years. PTSS and dysfunction items were subject to repeated measures latent class analysis to estimate common pathways. Respondents exhibited the following patterns over the 2 years: (1) no dysfunction/PTSS class members (58.2% - 78.8% of sample at Times 1-3) were unlikely to experience role impairment, interference with social activities/daily behaviors, difficulties handling stressors, or to report PTSS including re-experiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal; (2) low dysfunction/moderate PTSS class members (29.4-14.6%) were unlikely to report dysfunction symptoms but moderately likely to report PTSS; and (3) high dysfunction/PTSS class members (12.4-6.6%) were highly likely to exhibit both dysfunction and PTSS. Relative to the no dysfunction/PTSS class, membership in the low dysfunction/moderate PTSS class was predicted by exposure to Ike-related and post-Ike stressors. Membership in the high dysfunction/PTSS class was predicted by Ike-related and post-Ike traumatic events and stressors. These results illustrate distinct and co-occurring post-trauma PTSS and dysfunction trajectories. Alleviating ongoing post-trauma adverse circumstances may play a central role in mitigating the consequences of traumatic events.

AB  - Trauma survivors often experience posttraumatic stress (PTS) and report concurrent difficulties with emotion regulation (ER). Although individuals typically use multiple regulatory strategies to manage emotion, no studies yet examine the influence of a constellation of strategies on PTS in a community sample. We assessed six ER strategies and investigated whether specific profiles of ER (i.e. the typical pattern of regulation, determined by how often each strategy is used) were related to PTS. A hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that four distinct profiles were present: Adaptive Regulation, Active Regulation, Detached Regulation, and Maladaptive Regulation. Further analyses revealed that an individual's profile was not related to frequency of past trauma, but had the power to differentiate symptom severity for overall PTS and each symptom cluster of posttraumatic stress disorder. These findings highlight how profiles characterising multiple regulatory strategies offer a more complete understanding of the ways ER can account for PTS.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the associated factors and change trajectories of quality of life (QoL), global outcome, and post-concussion symptoms (PCS) over the first year following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).Methods: This was a prospective longitudinal study of 100 participants with mTBI from neurosurgical outpatient departments in Chiayi County District Hospitals in Taiwan. The checklist of post-concussion syndromes (CPCS) was used to assess PCS at enrollment and at 1, 3, and 12 months after mTBI; the glasgow outcome scale extended (GOSE), the quality of life after brain injured (QOLIBRI), Chinese version, and the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), Taiwan version, were used to assess mTBI global outcome and QoL at 1, 3, and 12 months after mTBI.Results: Latent class growth models (LCGMs) indicated the change trajectories of QOLIBRI, PCS SF-36, MCS SF-36, GOSE, and PCS. Classes of trajectory were associated with age >40 years, unemployment at 1 month after injury, and educational level <12 years. Univariate analysis revealed that employment status at 1 month post-injury was correlated with the trajectories of QOLIBRI, PCS SF-36, MCS SF-36, and GOSE, but not PCS.Conclusions: Employment status was the most crucial associated factor for QoL in individuals with mTBI at the 1-year follow-up. Future studies should explore the benefits of employment on QoL of individuals with mTBI. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - Research demonstrates substantial comorbidity between PTSD and alcohol use disorders. Evidence for functional relationships between PTSD and problematic alcohol use has not always been consistent, and there have been few investigations with adolescent samples. Further, research has not consistently controlled for cumulative potentially traumatic event (PTE) exposure when examining prospective relationships between PTSD and problematic alcohol use (i.e., binge drinking). This study examines the prospective relationships between PTSD symptoms, problematic alcohol use, and cumulative PTE exposure measured at three time points over approximately three years among a nationally representative sample of adolescents exposed to at least one PTE (n= 2399 and age range = 12-17 at Wave 1). Results from parallel process latent growth curve models demonstrated that increases in cumulative PTE exposure over time positively predicted increases in both PTSD symptoms and binge drinking, whereas increases in PTSD symptoms and increases in binge drinking were not related when controlling for the effect of cumulative PTE exposure. Further analyses suggested that these relationships are specific to assaultive PTEs and are not found with non-assaultive PTEs. Theoretical implications are discussed. (copyright) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objectives The World Trade Centre Health Registry (WTCHR) prospectively follows a cohort of over 71 000 individuals who reported being directly exposed to the 9/11/01 terrorist attack. Among police registrants at Survey Wave 2, 5-6 years after 9/11/01, four unique trajectories of probable PTSD symptoms were identified: resilient (83%), recovered (2.5%), delayed onset (11.2%) and chronic (5.3%). The current study documents the longitudinal trajectories of PTSD in police officers exposed to the WTC attacks at Wave 3 (2011-2012), over 10 years since the WTC attack. Method We examined the prevalence of probable PTSD at the Wave 3 survey using a cut-off score of 44 or greater on the event-specific Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) and at least one re-experiencing symptom (DSM-IV criterion B), three avoidance or numbing symptoms (DSM-IV criterion C), and two hyperarousal symptoms (DSM-IV criterion D). Results Probable PTSD was 14.4% (95% CI 13.0-15.9%) at Wave 2 and 12.9% (95% CI, 11.6-14.3%) at Wave 3. Significant predictors of chronic probable PTSD 10 years post-disaster (n = 59/2241, 2.6%) include age 45-69 (aOR 3.16, 95% CI, 1.7-6.0), number of stressful events witnessed on 9/11/01 (aOR 3.00, 1.6-5.8), five or more stressful life events since 9/11/01 (aOR 5.42, 1.9-15.2), and unmet mental health care needs (aOR 6.86, 3.3-14.1). Protective factors include social support (aOR 0.34, 0.1-0.97) and number of close friends or relatives (aOR 0.92, 0.87-0.98). Conclusions Chronic probable PTSD among police responders continues to be a significant problem, associated both with intervening stressful life events and unmet mental health care needs.

AB  - Typologies of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms and personality traits were evaluated in regard to coping styles and treatment preferences using data from 1266 trauma-exposed military veterans of which the majority were male (n=1097; weighted 89.6%). Latent profile analyses indicated a best-fitting 5-class solution; PTSD asymptomatic and emotionally stable (C1); predominant re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms and less emotionally stable (C2); subsyndromal PTSD (C3); predominant negative alterations in mood/cognitions and combined internalizing-externalizing traits (C4); and high PTSD severity and combined internalizing-externalizing traits (C5). Compared to C5, C1 members were less likely to use self-distraction, denial, and substance use and more likely to use active coping; C2 and C4 members were less likely to use denial and more likely to use behavioral disengagement; C3 members were less likely to use denial and instrumental coping and more likely to use active coping; most classes were less likely to seek mental health treatment. Compared to C1, C2 members were more likely to use self-distraction, substance use, behavioral disengagement and less likely to use active coping; C3 members were more likely to use self-distraction, and substance use, and less likely to use positive reframing, and acceptance; and C4 members were more likely to use denial, substance use, emotional support, and behavioral disengagement, and less likely to use active coping, positive reframing, and acceptance; all classes were more likely to seek mental health treatment. Emotional stability was most distinguishing of the typologies. Other implications are discussed.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD; Kessler et al., 1995) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; Brown et al., 2001). We aimed to (1) assess discrete patterns of post-trauma PTSD-depression-GAD symptoms using latent profile analyses (LPAs), and (2) assess covariates (gender, income, education, age) in defining the best fitting class solution. The PTSD Checklist (assessing PTSD symptoms), GAD-7 scale (assessing GAD symptoms), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (assessing depression) were administered to 1266 trauma-exposed Ohio National Guard soldiers. Results indicated three discrete subgroups based on symptom patterns with mild (class 1), moderate (class 2) and severe (class 3) levels of symptomatology. Classes differed in symptom severity rather than symptom type. Income and education significantly predicted class 1 versus class 3 membership, and class 2 versus class 3. In conclusion, there is heterogeneity regarding severity of PTSD-depression-GAD symptomatology among trauma-exposed soldiers, with income and education predictive of class membership.

AB  - We conducted a follow-up assessment to assess the development of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression among Chinese immigrants after the World Trade Center attack. Sixty-five Chinese displaced workers who were originally interviewed in May 2002 were re-interviewed in March 2003. Whereas depression scores decreased over time, average PTSD scores remained unchanged. The trajectory of posttraumatic stress symptoms was more complex, with an increasing number of individuals who show no or little emotional health problems and another increasing group of individuals with exacerbated posttraumatic stress symptoms. Although the mean values of the re-experiencing and hypervigilance cluster did not change over time, the mean value of the avoidance/numbing cluster increased significantly from time 1 (M = 4.60, SD = 4.98) to time 2 (M = 6.34, SD = 4.24), (F1.61 = 5.69, P = .02). A higher proportion of subjects met diagnostic criteria of PTSD at time 2 (27%) than at time 1 (21%). The study highlights the importance of ongoing mental health surveillance of diverse cultural and linguistic groups after a major traumatic event. (copyright) The Author 2005.

AB  - Objective: Early childhood is a high-risk time for exposure to potentially traumatic medical events. We have previously reported that 10% of young children continue to have posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 6 months after burn injury. This study aimed to 1) document the prevalence and prospective change in parental psychological distress over 6 months following their child's burn injury and 2) identify risk factors for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in young children and their parents. Methods: Participants were 120 parents of 1-6-year-old children with unintentional burn injuries. Data were collected within 2 weeks, 1 month, and 6 months of burn injury using developmentally sensitive diagnostic interviews and questionnaires. Results: Within the first month,~25% of parents had a probable PTSD diagnosis, and moderate to extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Distress levels decreased significantly over time; however, 5% of parents still had probable PTSD at 6 months. Hierarchical multiple regression and path analyses indicated that parent posttraumatic stress reactions contributed significantly to the development and maintenance of child PTSS. Other risk factors for child PTSS included premorbid emotional and behavioral difficulties and larger burn size. Risk factors identified for parent PTSS included prior trauma history, acute distress, greater number of child invasive procedures, guilt, and child PTSS. Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that parents' responses to a traumatic event may play a particularly important role in a young child's psychological recovery. However, further research is needed to confirm the direction of the relationship between child and parent distress. This study identified variables that could be incorporated into screening tools or targeted by early intervention protocols to prevent the development of persistent child and parent PTSS following medical trauma.

AB  - Objective: To investigate trajectories of PTSD and depression following traumatic injury using latent class growth curve modeling. Method: A longitudinal study of 330 injured trauma survivors was conducted and participants were assessed during hospitalization, and at 1, 3, and 6 months follow-up. Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) was assessed during hospitalization using the Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASD-I), PTSD was measured at all follow-up with the Post-Traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS) and depression was measured at hospitalization with the (BSI) and at follow-up with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESDS). Covariates were explored, including coping self-efficacy, anger, education level, and mechanism of injury. Results: Four latent classes were identified for PTSD and Depression symptoms: chronic distress, delayed distress, recovered, and resilience. When compared to the resilient group, individuals with chronic distress were more likely to have been assaulted, had higher levels of anger, and had less coping self-efficacy. The delayed distress group had lower education levels, higher levels of coping self-efficacy, and higher levels of anger. Individuals in the recovered group had fewer years of education, and higher levels of anger. Conclusion: The majority of the injured trauma sample demonstrated resiliency, with those exhibiting distress doing so as a delayed, chronic, or recovered trajectory. Coping self efficacy, education, assaultive trauma type, and anger were important covariates of depression and PTSD trajectories. These results are similar to studies of individuals who experienced a major health threat and with survivors from the World Trade Center attacks in the U.S. (copyright) 2010 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Few studies have incorporated multiple dimensions of victimization or examined whether victimization profiles differ by gender. Consequently, the present study sought to extend prior research by using latent class analysis (LCA) to identify naturally occurring subgroups of individuals who have experienced victimization, and to test for sex differences. Data from 4,016 females and 3,032 males in the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS) were analyzed. Evidence of the existence of similar victimization subtypes for both males and females emerged, with a three-class solution providing the best fit to the data for both sexes. Furthermore, the classes were labeled "low victimization" (the baseline class; Class 3), the "high victimization class" (Class 1), and "the bullying and domestic violence class" (Class 2) for both males and females. Multinomial logistic regression was used to interpret the nature of the latent classes, or groups, by estimating the associations with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) dimensions, suicide attempt, and non-suicidal self-injury. Although different constellations of victimization experiences did not emerge through the gender-specific analyses, the nature of the associations between class membership and external variables differed between males and females. Findings highlight the heterogeneity of victimization experiences and their relations to functioning, and have implications for policy and practice implications.

AB  - Notes that there has been interest in and application of cluster analysis in longitudinal applications to identify distinctive developmental patterns of intraindividual change. This article used Monte Carlo experiments to evaluate the adequacy of cluster analysis to recover group membership based on simulated latent growth curve (LGC) models. The simulated LGC models were manipulated by varying growth parameters (e.g., elevation, dispersion, and shape) for subpopulation growth curves (e.g., linear and quadratic growth models). The evaluation of cluster analysis to recover individual membership in these growth curve subpopulations was completed via the Kappa statistics. Cluster analysis failed to recover adequately growth subtypes when the difference between growth curves was shape only. It was much more successful when the distance between initial mean levels was large (e.g., difference of two standard deviations), independent of difference in the shape of the growth curves. Tentative guidelines were proposed to facilitate the evaluation of the adequacy of a cluster analytic solution to recover subtype heterogeneity in longitudinal (intraindividual) growth curves.

AB  - Background: Deployment can put soldiers at risk of developing post-traumatic stress symptoms. Despite several longitudinal studies, little is known about the timing of an increase in post-traumatic stress symptoms relative to pre-deployment. Longitudinal studies starting pre-deployment, in which participants are repeatedly measured over time, are warranted to assess the timing of an increase in symptoms to ultimately assess the timing of an increase in treatment demand after deployment. Methods: In this large observational cohort study, Dutch military personnel who were deployed to Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Forces between March, 2005, and September, 2008, were assessed for post-traumatic stress symptoms with the Self-Rating Inventory for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (SRIP) questionnaire. Participants were assessed 1 month before deployment and followed up at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, and 5 years after deployment, with changes in SRIP scores compared with pre-deployment using a mixed model analysis. The primary outcome was the total score of post-traumatic stress symptoms measured with SRIP at pre-deployment and the five follow-up assessments, with a score of 38 used as the cutoff to indicate substantial post-traumatic stress symptoms. Findings: Between March, 2005, and September, 2008, 1007 participants were recruited to this study. The results show two important effects of deployment on post-traumatic stress symptoms. A short-term symptom increase within the first 6 months after deployment (symptom increase coefficient for SRIP score vs pre-deployment [β] 0·99, 95% CI 0·50-1·48); and a long-term symptom increase at 5 years after deployment (β 1·67, 1·14-2·20). Interpretation: This study underlines the importance of long-term monitoring of the psychological health of soldiers after deployment because early detection of symptoms is essential to early treatment, which is related to improved psychological health.

AB  - Emotion regulatory strategies such as higher expressive suppression and lower cognitive reappraisal may be associated with increased psychopathology (Gross & John, 2003). Yet, it is unclear whether these strategies represent distinct cognitive styles associated with psychopathology, such that there are individuals who are predominantly "suppressors" or "reappraisers." Using cluster analysis, we examined whether women with and without exposure to potentially traumatic events evidence distinct patterns of emotion regulation frequency, capacity, suppression, and cognitive reappraisal. Four patterns emerged: high regulators; high reappraisers/low suppressors; moderate reappraisers/low suppressors; and low regulators. Individuals who reported infrequently and ineffectively regulating their emotions (low regulators) also reported higher depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In contrast, individuals who reported frequently and effectively using reappraisal and low levels of suppression (high reappraisers/low suppressors) reported the lowest levels of these symptoms, suggesting that this specific combination of emotion regulation may be most adaptive. Our findings highlight that the capacity to regulate emotions and the ability to flexibly apply different strategies based on the context and timing may be associated with reduced psychopathology and more adaptive functioning.

AB  - Objective: Individuals who assume caregiving duties for a family member disabled in a traumatic injury often exhibit considerable distress, yet few studies have examined characteristics of those who may be resilient in the initial year of caregiving. Reasoning from the influential Pearlin model of caregiving (Pearlin & Aneshensel, 1994) and the resilience process model (Bonanno, 2005), we expected a significant minority of caregivers would be chronically distressed and another group would be resilient throughout the inaugural year of caregiving for a person with a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), and these groups would differ significantly in primary and secondary stress and in personal resources and mediators. Method: Twenty men and 108 women who identified as caregivers for a family member who incurred a traumatic SCI consented to complete measures during the inpatient rehabilitation and at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months postdischarge. Results: Latent growth mixture modeling of depression symptoms over time revealed 3 groups of caregivers: chronic (24%), recovery (24%) and resilient (48%). The chronic group reported more anxiety, negative affect, and ill health than the other 2 groups throughout the year. The resilient group was best characterized by their enduring levels of positive affect and supportive social networks. Conclusions: A large percentage of individuals are resilient in the initial year of caregiving, and those who have problems adapting exhibit significant distress soon following the traumatic event. Early detection of and psychological interventions for individuals who have difficulty adjusting are indicated, as their distress is unlikely to abate untreated over the year. © 2014 American Psychological Association.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examines the patterns and predictors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom trajectories among adolescent survivors following the Wenchuan earthquake in China. METHOD: A total of 1573 adolescent survivors were followed up at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post-earthquake. Participants completed the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Self-Rating Scale (PTSD-SS), Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Checklist, Social Support Rate Scale, and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Distinct patterns of PTSD symptom trajectories were established through grouping participants based on time-varying changes of developing PTSD (i.e. reaching the clinical cut-off on the PTSD-SS). Multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine predictors for trajectory membership. RESULTS: PTSD prevalence rates at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months were 21.0, 23.3, 13.5 and 14.7%, respectively. Five PTSD symptom trajectories were observed: resistance (65.3% of the sample), recovery (20.0%), relapsing/remitting (3.3%), delayed dysfunction (4.2%) and chronic dysfunction (7.2%). Female gender and senior grade were related to higher risk of developing PTSD symptoms in at least one time point, whereas being an only child increased the possibility of recovery relative to chronic dysfunction. Family members' injury/loss and witness of traumatic scenes could also cause PTSD chronicity. More negative life events, less social support, more negative coping and less positive coping were also common predictors for not developing resistance or recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents' PTSD symptoms showed an anniversary reaction. Although many adolescents remain euthymic or recover over time, some adolescents, especially those with the risk factors noted above, exhibit chronic, delayed or relapsing symptoms. Thus, the need for individualized intervention with these adolescents is indicated.

AB  - The aim of this article is to investigate the effects of cluster munitions on the different environmental, anatomical and neuropsychological levels. We conducted a study to explore the effects of sub-munitions on Lebanese victims. The study included a total of 407 cases that have been subjected to the detonation of unexploded sub-munitions in Lebanon, between 2006 and 2011. In our series, 356 casualties were injured and 51 were dead. 382 were males and 25 were females. We recorded 83 cases of amputations, and injuries involving cranio-facial regions, thorax, abdomen, and upper and lower extremities. These injuries lead to loss of function, body disfiguration, and chronic pain caused by the injuries or the amputations, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. The peripheral nervous system was mostly affected and patients suffered from significant psychosocial tribulations. Cluster munitions harm human beings and decrease biodiversity. Survivors suffer from physical and psychological impairments. Laws should be passed and enforced to ban the use of these detrimental weapons that have negative effects on ecosystem and societal levels. (copyright) 2013 Springer-Verlag Italia.

AB  - The mental health (MH) of soldiers remains extremely newsworthy and is regularly featured in high profile media forums that focus on post-traumatic stress disorder. However, the authors feel that there are distinct benefits to serving within the Army, and that it provides effective occupational medical, MH and welfare support. This research study explores potential benefits and stressors of being in the Army and provides an overview of Army mental health services (AMHS) through the perspectives of AMHS personnel, 84% of which were nurses. The study indicated that the Army can provide a protective community, sharing a bond based on common values and experiences. The Army can provide soldiers with career opportunities that are not available in civilian life, and there are opportunities to develop an employment profile, enhanced by internal and external educational training, and encapsulated within a progressive career pathway. The Army can also be seen to offer an escape route, preventing soldiers entering a life of crime, and supplying the stable family these soldiers had never experienced. The provision of leadership, within an environment where soldiers are valued and stigma is not tolerated can potentially shield against MH problems.

AB  - This study attempted to extend research indicating that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) factors of Re-experiencing, Avoidance and Hyperarousal are more related to Fear/phobic disorders, while PTSD Dysphoria is more related to Anxious-Misery disorders. Trauma exposure, PTSD and comorbidity data for 668 veteran patients were analysed using confirmatory factor analyses and relative strengths of the relationships between PTSD factors and the Fear and Anxious-Misery factors were assessed. Combining Simms, Watson, and Doebbeling's (2002) model of PTSD symptoms and Krueger's (1999) Fear/Anxious Misery model of mood and anxiety disorders fit the data well. Contrary to previous research, PTSD Re-experiencing, Avoidance and Hyperarousal did not correlate more with the Fear factor; nor did PTSD Dysphoria correlate more with Anxious-Misery. Hyperarousal was more closely related to Fear than was Re-experiencing; however, Avoidance was not. Dysphoria was more closely related to the Anxious-Misery factor than all other PTSD factors.

AB  - Objective: The proposed DSM-V criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) specifically require both active avoidance and emotional numbing symptoms for a diagnosis. In DSM-IV, since both are included in the same cluster, active avoidance is not essential. Numbing symptoms overlap with depression, which may result in spurious comorbidity or overdiagnosis of PTSD. This paper investigated the impact of requiring both active avoidance and emotional numbing on the rates of PTSD diagnosis and comorbidity with depression. Method: We investigated PTSD and depression in 835 traumatic injury survivors at 3 and 12 months post-injury. We used the DSM-IV criteria but explored the potential impact of DSM-IV and DSM-V approaches to avoidance and numbing using comparison of proportion analyses. Results: The DSM-V requirement of both active avoidance and emotional numbing resulted in significant reductions in PTSD caseness compared with DSM-IV of 22% and 26% respectively at 3 and 12 months posttrauma. By 12 months, the rates of comorbid PTSD in those with depression were significantly lower (44% vs. 34%) using the new criteria, primarily due to the lack of avoidance symptoms. Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that requiring both active avoidance and numbing as separate clusters offers a useful refinement of the PTSD diagnosis. Requiring active avoidance may help to define the unique aspects of PTSD and reduce spurious diagnoses of PTSD in those with depression. (copyright) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: Survivors of traumatic events of an interpersonal nature typically have higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than survivors of noninterpersonal traumatic events. Little is known about potential differences in the nature or trajectory of PTSD symptoms in survivors of these different types of traumatic events. The current study aimed to identify the specific symptom profile of survivors of interpersonal and noninterpersonal trauma, and to examine changes in differences in the symptom profile over time. Method: The study examined PTSD symptom data from 715 traumatic injury survivors admitted to the hospital between April 2004 and February 2006, who were assessed 3, 12, and 24 months after injury using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (primary outcome measure). Multivariate analyses of variance were used to investigate differences in PTSD symptom profile over time between interpersonal and noninterpersonal trauma. Results: Multivariate analyses of variance revealed significant differences between the 2 groups in overall severity of PTSD symptoms at each of the 3 time points: 3 months, F17,696 = 5.86, P < .001; 12 months, F17,696 = 3.62, P < .001; 24 months, F17,696 = 3.09, P < .001. Survivors of interpersonal trauma demonstrated significantly (P < .01) higher scores on 14 PTSD symptoms at 3 months after injury but on only 6 symptoms by 24 months. Symptoms on which differences persisted were the PTSD unique symptoms more associated with fear and threat. Conclusions: Interpersonal trauma results in more severe PTSD symptoms in the early aftermath of trauma. Over the course of time, the distinctive persisting symptoms following interpersonal trauma involve fear-based symptoms, which suggest fear conditioning may be instrumental in persistent interpersonal PTSD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little research to date has explored the typologies of psychopathology following trauma, beyond development of particular diagnoses such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The objective of this study was to determine the longitudinal patterns of these typologies, especially the movement of persons across clusters of psychopathology. METHOD: In this 6-year longitudinal study, 1,167 hospitalized severe injury patients who were recruited between April 2004-February 2006 were analyzed, with repeated measures at baseline, 3 months, 12 months, and 72 months after injury. All patients met the DSM-IV criterion A1 for PTSD. Structured clinical interviews were used to assess psychiatric disorders at each follow-up point. Latent class analysis and latent transition analysis were applied to assess clusters of individuals determined by psychopathology. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) were employed to complete diagnoses. RESULTS: Four latent classes were identified at each time point: (1) Alcohol/Depression class (3 months, 2.1%; 12 months, 1.3%; and 72 months, 1.1%), (2) Alcohol class (3 months, 3.3%; 12 months, 3.7%; and 72 months, 5.4%), (3) PTSD/Depression class (3 months, 10.3%; 12 months, 11.5%; and 72 months, 6.4%), and (4) No Disorder class (3 months, 84.2%; 12 months, 83.5%; and 72 months, 87.1%). Latent transition analyses conducted across the 2 transition points (12 months and 72 months) found consistently high levels of stability in the No Disorder class (90.9%, 93.0%, respectively) but lower and reducing levels of consistency in the PTSD/Depression class (81.3%, 46.6%), the Alcohol/Depression class (59.7%, 21.5%), and the Alcohol class (61.0%, 36.5%), demonstrating high levels of between-class migration. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the array of psychiatric disorders that may develop following severe injury, a 4-class model best described the data with excellent classification certainty. The high levels of migration across classes indicate a complex pattern of psychopathology expression over time. The findings have considerable implications for tailoring multifocused interventions to class type, as well as flexible stepped care models, and for the potential development and delivery of transdiagnostic interventions targeting underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Objectives: This study aims to detect the prevalence of common mental disorders among patients seen by doctors at family health program units in Petropolis-RJ, and to establish their nosological profile. Method: The population of the study included all 18 to 65-year-old patient who attended any family health program units included in the study during a 30-day period, between August and December 2002 (n = 714). The prevalence of common mental disorders was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire, 12 item version. In order to establish the nosological profile, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview was administered to all common mental disorders positive patients who accepted to return (n = 215). Results: At the cut-off point of 2/3 the common mental disorders prevalence was 56% and for 4/5, it was 33%. The most frequent nosological categories found among common mental disorders positive patients were depression and anxiety categories along with posttraumatic stress disorder, somatoform pain disorder and dissociative disorders. There was a high frequency of comorbidity, especially between anxiety, depression, somatoform and dissociative disorders. Conclusions: The common mental disorders prevalence and the nosological profile found in FHP were similar to those of other primary care studies in Brazil, but some disorders (posttraumatic stress disorder, somatoform pain disorder and dissociative disorders) that had not been previously studied in this context were also very frequent. The high common mental disorders prevalence found reinforces the urgent need for systematic inclusion of this level of care in mental health assistance planning.

AB  - Both categorical and dimensional models of mental disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are useful for diagnostic and heuristic purposes; however, few empirical studies have compared categorical and dimensional models of PTSD side-by-side or compared these models to a hybrid (dimensional and categorical) model. In the present study, the dimensionality of PTSD was examined by fitting latent profile analytic, confirmatory factor analytic, and factor mixture models in 271 Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom veterans 6 months after return from deployment. Latent profile analysis was used to identify subgroups of individuals with similar PTSD symptom profiles and predictors of subgroup membership, confirmatory factor analysis was used to identify the underlying continuous structure of PTSD in this sample, and factor mixture modeling was used to test whether a hybrid categorical and continuous model of PTSD best fit our sample. A factor mixture model consisting of a 4-factor dysphoria model of PTSD with 2 classes characterized by low and moderate symptom severity was the best-fitting model. Dissociation and deployment concerns emerged as significant predictors of membership in the moderate symptoms class. Implications for PTSD diagnostic conceptualization and treatment planning are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A dissociative subtype has been recognized based on the presence of experiences of depersonalization and derealization in relation to DSM-IV posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the dissociative subtype has not been assessed in a community sample in relation to the revised DSM-5 PTSD criteria. Moreover, the 20-item PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) currently does not assess depersonalization and derealization. METHOD: We therefore evaluated two items for assessing depersonalization and derealization in 557 participants recruited online who endorsed PTSD symptoms of at least moderate severity on the PCL-5. RESULTS: A five-class solution identified two PTSD classes who endorsed dissociative experiences associated with either 1) severe or 2) moderate PTSD symptom severity (D-PTSD classes). Those in the severe dissociative class were particularly likely to endorse histories of childhood physical and sexual abuse. A principal axis factor analysis of the symptom list identified six latent variables: 1) Reexperiencing, 2) Emotional Numbing/Anhedonia, 3) Dissociation, 4) Negative Alterations in Cognition & Mood, 5) Avoidance, and 6) Hyperarousal. CONCLUSIONS: The present results further support the presence of a dissociative subtype within the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD.

AB  - Postnatal depression is among the most frequent mental disorders in young women (incidence 10-15%). Besides depressive illness, however anxiety disorder, stress disorder and psychosis play an important role as well. These disorders have not only negative impact on women's mental health, but may also adversely affect the child's development as well as the mother-child relationship. Inpatient mother-child care as established e.g. at the Heidelberg University Hospital offers adequate treatment without the need for the mother to separate from her child. In a retrospective study a profile of the women treated at the Psychiatric Department of the University Hospital Heidelberg was developed which reflects the psychological and social stress in their life situations. In order to gain an overview on the specific treatment options the data were then compared with those of other national and international centres. Analysis of demand shows that this mother-child psychiatric care is well accepted by the population and that there is a considerable need for adequate in- and outpatient care of postnatal mental disorders.

AB  - Background: Predicting pathways to chronic PTSD has significant clinical and public health implications but current risk indicators are inconsistent and limited. Previously identified in a large cohort of recent trauma survivors (n=957) using Latent Growth Mixture Modeling, trajectories of PTSD symptoms from one-week to fifteenmonths, include Rapid Remission (56%), Slow Remission (27%), and Non-Remission (17%), the non-remission class comprising the majority PTSD cases at fifteen months, and not responding to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Innovative approaches to forecasting membership in a nonremitting, treatment resistant class may improve our ability to identify, shortly after trauma exposure, survivors at high risk of developing PTSD. We tested the robustness of seven machine learning forecasting methods to predicting the non-remitting class from predictor variables collected during the days that followed trauma exposure. Methods: Consecutive trauma survivors admitted to a general hospital emergency department were screened and followed longitudinally and n=125 with Acute PTSD received efficient cognitive behavioral therapy within a month of the traumatic event. CBT was equally distributed among trajectory classes. Survivors were followed regardless and blindly of their participation in treatment. Markov boundary feature selection was used to identify a parsimonious set of trajectory predictors from 68 candidate variables. That set was than used to compare seven classification algorithms [two variants of linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs), polynomial SVMs, AdaBoost, Random Forests, Bayesian Logistic Regression (BBR) and Kernal Ridge Regression (KRR)] for their ability to build accurate multivariate classification models separating nonremission from other trajectories: Support Vector Machines (SVMs), two Optimized SVMs, AdaBoost, Random Forests, Bayesian Logistic Regression (BBR) and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR). Results: Variables selected by Markov boundary method robustly predicted PTSD symptom course yielding with mean area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) across 100 cross-validation runs ranging from 0.77- 0.80. The seven machine learning classification methods worked equivalently well: Linear SVMs AUC=0.78, 95% CI: [0.74 0.82]; Linear Optimized SVMs=0.78, 95% CI: [0.73 0.82]; Polynomial Optimized SVMs=0.77, 95% CI: [0.73 0.81]; Random Forests=0.80, 95% CI: [0.76 0.84]; AdaBoost=0.79, 95% CI: [0.75 0.83]; KRR=0.79, 95% CI: [0.75 0.83]; BBR=0.78, 95% CI: [0.74 0.82]. Predictors that identified in >90% of cross validation training sets included specific demographic (age), trauma characteristics (exposure to terror, head injury) emergency room parameters (pain levels, time in the emergency room) formal symptoms (total PTSD and Acute Stress Disorder severity and, independently, difficulty concentrating, nightmares, flashbacks, de-realization), depression, sense of worthlessness, and subjective perception indicators (participants' and clinicians' Clinical Global Impression, perceived need of help, perceived social support). Forecasting from PTSD/ and ASD symptoms alone performed less well than the previous, unrestricted, array of predictors (AUC=0.69). Conclusions: Uncovering the heterogeneous course of PTSD symptom during the year that follows a traumatic event provides a predictable non-remitting phenotype with relevance for early detection and treatment. Machinelearning approaches offer a promising way to identify non-remission from readily available features of the immediate response to traumatic events.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scientific research into mental health outcomes following trauma is undergoing a revolution as scientists refocus their efforts to identify underlying dimensions of health and psychopathology. This effort is in stark contrast to the previous focus which was to characterize individuals based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnostic status (Insel et al., 2010). A significant unresolved issue underlying this shift is how to characterize clinically relevant populations without reliance on the categorical definitions provided by the DSM. Classifying individuals based on their pattern of stress adaptation over time holds significant promise for capturing inherent inter-individual heterogeneity as responses including chronicity, recovery, delayed onset, and resilience can only be determined longitudinally (Galatzer-Levy & Bryant, 2013) and then characterizing these patterns for future research (Depaoli, Van de Schoot, Van Loey, & Sijbrandij, 2015). Such an approach allows for the identification of phenominologically similar patterns of response to diverse extreme environmental stressors (Bonanno, Kennedy, Galatzer-Levy, Lude, & Elfstom, 2012; Galatzer-Levy & Bonanno, 2012; Galatzer-Levy, Brown, et al., 2013; Galatzer-Levy, Burton, & Bonanno, 2012) including translational animal models of stress adaptation (Galatzer-Levy, Bonanno, Bush, & LeDoux, 2013; Galatzer-Levy, Moscarello, et al., 2014). The empirical identification of heterogeneous stress response patterns can increase the identification of mechanisms (Galatzer-Levy, Steenkamp, et al., 2014), consequences (Galatzer-Levy & Bonanno, 2014), treatment effects (Galatzer-Levy, Ankri, et al., 2013), and prediction (Galatzer-Levy, Karstoft, Statnikov, & Shalev, 2014) of individual differences in response to trauma. METHOD: METHODological and theoretical considerations for the application of Latent Growth Mixture Modeling (LGMM) and allied methods such as Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) for the identification of heterogeneous populations defined by their pattern of change over time will be presented (Van De Schoot, 2015). Common pitfalls including non-identification, over identification, and issues related to model specification will be discussed as well as the benefits of applying such methods along with the theoretical grounding of such approaches. CONCLUSIONS: LGMM and allied methods have significant potential for improving the science of stress pathology as well as our understanding of healthy adaptation (resilience).

AB  - Context:Uncovering heterogeneities in the progression of early PTSD symptoms can improve our understanding of the disorder's pathogenesis and prophylaxis.Objectives:To describe discrete symptom trajectories and examine their relevance for preventive interventions.Design:Latent Growth Mixture Modeling (LGMM) of data from a randomized controlled study of early treatment. LGMM identifies latent longitudinal trajectories by exploring discrete mixture distributions underlying observable data.Setting:Hadassah Hospital unselectively receives trauma survivors from Jerusalem and vicinity.Participants:Adult survivors of potentially traumatic events consecutively admitted to the hospital's emergency department (ED) were assessed ten days and one-, five-, nine- and fifteen months after ED admission. Participants with data at ten days and at least two additional assessments (n = 957) were included; 125 received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) between one and nine months.Approach:We used LGMM to identify latent parameters of symptom progression and tested the effect of CBT on these parameters. CBT consisted of 12 weekly sessions of either cognitive therapy (n = 41) or prolonged exposure (PE, n = 49), starting 29.8±5.7 days after ED admission, or delayed PE (n = 35) starting at 151.8±42.4 days. CBT effectively reduced PTSD symptoms in the entire sample.Main Outcome Measure:Latent trajectories of PTSD symptoms; effects of CBT on these trajectories.Results:Three trajectories were identified: Rapid Remitting (rapid decrease in symptoms from 1- to 5-months; 56% of the sample), Slow Remitting (progressive decrease in symptoms over 15 months; 27%) and Non-Remitting (persistently elevated symptoms; 17%). CBT accelerated the recovery of the Slow Remitting class but did not affect the other classes.Conclusions:The early course of PTSD symptoms is characterized by distinct and diverging response patterns that are centrally relevant to understanding the disorder and preventing its occurrence. Studies of the pathogenesis of PTSD may benefit from using clustered symptom trajectories as their dependent variables. © 2013 Galatzer-Levy et al.

AB  - Studies of individual differences in bereavement have revealed prototypical patterns of outcome. However, many of these studies were conducted prior to the advent of sophisticated contemporary data analytic techniques. For example, Bonanno et al. (2002) used rudimentary categorization procedures to identify unique trajectories of depression symptomatology from approximately 3 years prior to 4 years following conjugal loss in a representative sample of older American adults. In the current study, we revisited these same data using Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) to derive trajectories and test predictors. LCGA is a technique well-suited for modeling empirically- and conceptually-derived heterogeneous longitudinal patterns while simultaneously modeling predictors of those longitudinal patterns. We uncovered four discrete trajectories similar in shape and proportion to the previous analyses: Resilience (characterized by little or no depression; 66.3%), Chronic Grief (characterized by depression following loss, alleviated by 4 years post-loss; 9.1%), _Pre-existing Chronic Depression (ongoing high pre- through post-loss depression; 14.5%), and Depressed-Improved (characterized by high pre-loss depression that decreases following loss; 10.1%). Using this analytic strategy, we were able to examine multiple hypotheses about bereavement simultaneously. Health, financial stress, and emotional stability emerged as strong predictors of variability in depression only for some trajectories, indicating that depression levels do not have a common etiology across all the bereaved. As such, we find that identifying distinct patterns informs both the course and etiology of depression in response to bereavement. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: A growing body of literature suggests that college students display alarming rates of psychological distress. However, studies of responses to significant life stressors in other contexts have found that people respond in heterogeneous ways and that attachment style and ego-resiliency mitigate the effects of stressors on mental health. Method: Individual differences in distress among a cohort of students (N=157; Mean age=18.8 years, 62.6% female) across the four years of college were analyzed using latent class growth analysis. Trajectories were then regressed on levels of anxious and avoidant attachment and ego-resiliency. Results: Four discrete patterns emerged characterized by healthy and maladaptive patterns of stress response, indicating that students respond to college in heterogeneous ways. Several patterns showed significant variability in distress by semester. Low levels of anxious but not avoidant attachment predicted membership in the stable-low distress or resilient class while ego-resiliency predicted membership in both the resilient and moderate distress classes. Conclusions: Findings indicate that low levels of anxious attachment and the ability to flexibly cope with adversity may be associated with better mental health throughout college. Implications from stress response and developmental perspectives are discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Responses to both potentially traumatic events and other significant life stressors have been shown to conform to discrete patterns of response such as resilience, anticipatory stress, initial distress with gradual recovery, and chronic distress. The etiology of these trajectories is still unclear. Individual differences in levels of negative and positive emotion are believed to play a role in determining risk and resilience following traumatic exposure. In the current investigation, we followed police officers prospectively from academy training through 48 months of active duty, assessing levels of distress every 12 months. Using latent class growth analysis, we identified 4 trajectories closely conforming to prototypical patterns. Furthermore, we found that lower levels of self-reported negative emotion during academy training prospectively predicted membership in the resilient trajectory compared with the more symptomatic trajectories following the initiation of active duty, whereas higher levels of positive emotion during academy training differentiated resilience from a trajectory that was equivalently low on distress during academy training but consistently grew in distress through 4 years of active duty. These findings emerging from a prospective longitudinal design provide evidence that resilience is predicted by both lower levels of negative emotion and higher levels of positive emotion prior to active duty stressor exposure. © 2013 American Psychological Association.

AB  - College has been shown to be a particularly stressful time both due to unique emergent stressors and because of increased vulnerability for exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs). Both of these conditions are associated with heightened risk for the development of stress-related pathology. However, while this period may be particularly challenging, previous work shows most students adapt in a number of heterogeneous ways that result in little or no stress-related symptomatology over the four years of college. There is indication from the coping literature that the ability to flexibly move between multiple coping behaviors may foster resilient outcomes. In this study, we examined trajectories of distress, using Latent Growth Mixture Modeling, and whether flexible coping aids in adaption. Results showed that trajectories were not influenced by exposure to a PTE and that the common outcome was little or no distress over the four years of college. Flexible coping was strongly associated with a resilient outcome. © 2012 Guilford Publications, Inc.

AB  - There is broad interest in predicting the clinical course of mental disorders from early, multimodal clinical and biological information. Current computational models, however, constitute a significant barrier to realizing this goal. The early identification of trauma survivors at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is plausible given the disorder's salient onset and the abundance of putative biological and clinical risk indicators. This work evaluates the ability of Machine Learning (ML) forecasting approaches to identify and integrate a panel of unique predictive characteristics and determine their accuracy in forecasting non-remitting PTSD from information collected within10 days of a traumatic event. Data on event characteristics, emergency department observations, and early symptoms were collected in 957 trauma survivors, followed for fifteen months. An ML feature selection algorithm identified a set of predictors that rendered all others redundant. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as well as other ML classification algorithms were used to evaluate the forecasting accuracy of i) ML selected features, ii) all available features without selection, and iii) Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) symptoms alone. SVM also compared the prediction of a) PTSD diagnostic status at 15 months to b) posterior probability of membership in an empirically derived non-remitting PTSD symptom trajectory. Results are expressed as mean Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC). The feature selection algorithm identified 16 predictors, present in ≥95% cross-validation trials. The accuracy of predicting non-remitting PTSD from that set (AUC=77) did not differ from predicting from all available information (AUC=78). Predicting from ASD symptoms was not better then chance (AUC=60). The prediction of PTSD status was less accurate than that of membership in a non-remitting trajectory (AUC=71). ML methods may fill a critical gap in forecasting PTSD. The ability to identify and integrate unique risk indicators makes this a promising approach for developing algorithms that infer probabilistic risk of chronic posttraumatic stress psychopathology based on complex sources of biological, psychological, and social information.

AB  - Heterogeneity in glucocorticoid response to experimental stress conditions has shown to differentiate individuals with healthy from maladaptive real-life stress responses in a number of distinct domains. However, it is not known if this heterogeneity influences the risk for developing stress related disorders or if it is a biological consequence of the stress response itself. Determining if glucocorticoid response to stress induction prospectively predicts psychological vulnerability to significant real life stressors can adjudicate this issue. To test this relationship, salivary cortisol as well as catecholamine responses to a laboratory stressor during academy training were examined as predictors of empirically identified distress trajectories through the subsequent 4 years of active duty among urban police officers routinely exposed to potentially traumatic events and routine life stressors (N=234). During training, officers were exposed to a video vignette of police officers exposed to real-life trauma. Changes in salivary 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and cortisol in response to this video challenge were examined as predictors of trajectory membership while controlling for age, gender, and baseline neuroendocrine levels. Officers who followed trajectories of resilience and recovery over 4 years mounted significant increases in cortisol in response to the experimental stressor, while those following a trajectory of chronic increasing distress had no significant cortisol change in response to the challenge. MHPG responses were not associated with distress trajectories. Cortisol response prospectively differentiated trajectories of distress response suggesting that a blunted cortisol response to a laboratory stressor is a risk factor for later vulnerability to distress following significant life stressors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: With an emphasis on betrayal trauma, this study used latent profile analysis to examine how childhood traumas co-occur and whether trauma patterns differentially predicted psychological distress. METHOD: A community sample of 806 adolescents and young adults participated. Youths reported their trauma histories, and lifetime DSM-IV disorders were assessed using a structured diagnostic interview. RESULTS: Latent profile analysis yielded 5 profiles: high betrayal trauma physical violence and emotional abuse (HBTPE), high betrayal trauma sexual and emotional abuse (HBTSE), low betrayal trauma (LBT), parent death (PD), and a no/low trauma profile. Logistic regression analyses compared youths in the no/low trauma profile to those in the trauma profiles. Youths in the HBTPE profile were more likely to have moderate/severe major depressive disorder (odds ratio [OR] = 2.92, 95% CI [1.16, 7.32]), posttraumatic stress disorder (OR = 4.33, 95% CI [1.34, 14.03]), and hallucinations (OR = 5.03, 95% CI [2.00, 12.67]); youths in the HBTSE and LBT profiles were more likely to experience hallucinations (OR = 3.19, 95% CI [1.21, 8.39] and OR = 3.20, 95% CI [1.01, 10.19], respectively); and youths in the PD profile were more likely to have moderate/severe depression (OR = 2.42, 95% CI [1.07, 5.43]). CONCLUSIONS: Specific trauma types co-occurred when considering type, level of betrayal, and frequency. The emergence of the 2 high betrayal trauma profiles, with differing symptom presentations, suggests that experiences of high betrayal traumas are not homogenous and specific trauma-focused interventions may be more appropriate for differing trauma profiles.

AB  - There is considerable evidence that immediate and long-term stress reactions are associated with increased somatic symptomatology. However, because of the scarcity of long-term longitudinal studies, the trend of mutual change of these factors has not been assessed. This study examined the chronological inter-relationships between post-traumatic stress reactions and somatization symptoms among combatants over a 20-year period. Two groups of veterans were assessed 1, 2, 3 and 20 years after their participation in the 1982 Lebanon War: a clinical group of veterans who had been diagnosed with combat stress reaction (CSR) on the battlefield (n=363), and a matched control group of veterans (n=301). The CSR veterans reported higher initial levels of intrusion and avoidance and a steeper decline in those symptoms over time in comparison to the control group. The former also reported higher initial levels of somatization symptoms than the latter. In addition, over the years, stress reactions were positively associated with somatization symptoms. For both study groups, in the first years after the war, stress reaction symptoms predicted somatization symptoms. However, with time, the trend was reversed and somatization symptoms predicted stress reactions. The findings suggest that CSR is a marker for future stress reactions and somatization symptoms, and indicate a long-term role for these symptoms in veterans' psychological distress.

AB  - Latent class analysis was used to identify subgroups of victimized women (N = 406) on probation and parole differentiated by levels of general psychological distress. The 9 primary symptom dimensions from the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) were used individually as latent class indicators (Derogatis, 1993). Results identified 3 classes of women characterized by increasing levels of psychological distress; classes were further differentiated by posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, cumulative victimization, substance use and other domains of psychosocial functioning (i.e., sociodemographic characteristics; informal social support and formal service utilization; perceived life stress; and resource loss). The present research was effective in uncovering important heterogeneity in psychological distress using a highly reliable and easily accessible measure of general psychological distress. Differentiating levels of psychological distress and associated patterns of psychosocial risk can be used to develop intervention strategies targeting the needs of different subgroups of women. Implications for treatment and future research are presented.

AB  - Refugees resettled in the United States have disproportionately high rates of psychological distress. Research has demonstrated the roles of postmigration stressors, including lack of meaningful social roles, poverty, unemployment, lack of environmental mastery, discrimination, limited English proficiency, and social isolation. We report a multimethod, within-group longitudinal pilot study involving the adaptation for African refugees of a community-based advocacy and learning intervention to address postmigration stressors. We found the intervention to be feasible, acceptable, and appropriate for African refugees. Growth trajectory analysis revealed significant decreases in participants' psychological distress and increases in quality of life, and also provided preliminary evidence of intervention mechanisms of change through the detection of mediating relationships whereby increased quality of life was mediated by increases in enculturation, English proficiency, and social support. Qualitative data helped to support and explain the quantitative data. Results demonstrate the importance of addressing the sociopolitical context of resettlement to promote the mental health of refugees and suggest a culturally appropriate, and replicable model for doing so. © 2014 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Growing evidence supports the effectiveness of Trauma and Grief Component Therapy for Adolescents (TGCT-A) in reducing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and maladaptive grief (MG) reactions. This pilot study explored whether the specific focus of students' narratives (i.e., focus on trauma vs. focus on loss) as shared by TGCT-A group members would predict initial pretreatment levels, as well as pre- to posttreatment change trajectories, of PTSD symptoms and MG reactions. Thirty-three adolescents from three middle schools completed a 17-week course of group-based TGCT-A. PTSD and MG symptoms were assessed at pretreatment, twice during treatment, and at posttreatment. The focus (trauma vs. loss) of each student's narrative was coded using transcripts of members' narratives as shared within the groups. The reliable change index showed that 61% of students reported reliable pre-post improvement in either PTSD symptoms or MG reactions. Students whose narratives focused on loss both reported higher starting levels and showed steeper rates of decline in MG reactions than students whose narratives focused on trauma. In contrast, students whose narratives focused on trauma reported higher starting levels of PTSD than students who narrated loss experiences. However, narrative focus was not significantly linked to the rate at which PTSD symptoms declined over the course of treatment. This study provides preliminary evidence that TGCT-A treatment components are associated with reduced PTSD symptoms and MG reactions. Loss-focused narratives, in particular, appear to be associated with greater decreases in MG reactions. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - By the time children reach adolescence, most have experienced at least one type of severe adversity and many have been exposed to multiple types. However, whether patterns of adverse childhood experiences are consistent or change across developmental epochs in childhood is not known. Retrospective reports of adverse potentially traumatic childhood experiences in 3 distinct developmental epochs (early childhood, 0- to 5-years-old; middle childhood, 6- to 12-years-old; and adolescence, 13- to 18-years-old) were obtained from adolescents (N = 3485) referred to providers in the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) for trauma-focused assessment and treatment. Results from latent class analysis (LCA) revealed increasingly complex patterns of adverse/traumatic experiences in middle childhood and adolescence compared to early childhood. Depending upon the specific developmental epoch assessed, different patterns of adverse/traumatic experiences were associated with gender and with adolescent psychopathology (e.g., internalizing/externalizing behavior problems), and juvenile justice involvement. A multiply exposed subgroup that had severe problems in adolescence was evident in each of the 3 epochs, but their specific types of adverse/traumatic experiences differed depending upon the developmental epoch. Implications for research and clinical practice are identified.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) typically follows an acute to chronic course. However, some trauma victims do not report significant symptoms until a period of time has elapsed after the event. Although originally dismissed as an artifact of retrospective methodologies, recent prospective studies document apparent instances of delayed-onset PTSD. Little is known currently about factors associated with the delayed onset of PTSD. This study was designed to examine the course of PTSD in a sample of 1,040 U.S. military peacekeepers who served in Somalia. A small but nontrivial subset of participants endorsed clinically significant levels of PTSD after a period of minimal distress, the magnitude of which cannot be ascribed to minor waxing and waning of symptoms. War-zone exposure and perceived meaningfulness of the mission, as rated by soldiers after returning to the United States, predicted symptom course over the next 18 months.

AB  - Previous research on natural disasters has been limited by a lack of predisaster data and statistical analyses that do not adequately predict change in psychological symptoms. In the current study, we addressed these limitations through analysis of 3 waves of data from a longitudinal investigation of 313 low-income, African American mothers who were exposed to Hurricane Katrina. Although postdisaster cross-sectional estimates of the impact of traumatic stress exposure and postdisaster social support on postdisaster psychological distress were somewhat inflated, the general trends persisted when controlling for predisaster data (B = 0.88 and -0.33, vs. B = 0.81 and -0.27, respectively). Hierarchical linear modeling of the 3 waves of data revealed that lower predisaster social support was associated with higher psychological distress at the time of the disaster ((beta) = -.16), and that higher traumatic stress exposure was associated with greater increases in psychological distress after the storm ((beta) = .86). Based on the results, we suggest that the impact of traumatic stress on psychological trajectories cannot be accounted for solely by preexisting risk, and recommend more complex research designs to further illuminate the complex, dynamic relationships between psychological distress, traumatic stress exposure, and social support.

AB  - Secondary traumatization describes the phenomenon whereby those in proximity to trauma survivors develop psychological symptoms similar to those experienced by the direct survivor. The current study examined secondary trauma (ST) and generalized distress symptoms (general psychiatric symptomatology, functional disability, and self-rated health) in wives of former prisoners of war (ex-POWs). The study compared wives of Israeli ex-POWs from the 1973 Yom Kippur War with wives of a matched control group of non-POW Yom Kippur War combat veterans (CVs). The wives also were divided into groups based on their husbands' current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) status and PTSD trajectory (i.e., chronic, delayed), and their outcomes were compared with resilient CVs. We found that wives of ex-POWs with PTSD reported higher ST and generalized distress than wives of ex-POWs and non-POW CVs without PTSD. Wives of ex-POWs with chronic PTSD reported the highest levels of functional disability. We also found that the relationships between husbands' prior captivity, and wives' ST and general psychiatric symptomatology were fully mediated by the husbands' PTSD symptoms. These findings indicate that it is exposure to a partner with PTSD that leads to overall ST and other distress symptoms, and not simply to a trauma survivor. Furthermore, the more severe their husbands' PTSD, the more wives are at risk for ST and general psychiatric symptomatology. Wives of partners with PTSD should therefore be considered high-risk groups for ST and distress that may require targeted interventions.

AB  - Aim. Researchers addressing the mental health needs of inmates reported that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was one of the most common disorders. This study examined the patterns of PTSD symptoms and their relation to the self-reported level of distress and psychological wellbeing in a sample of Italian inmates. Methods. Fifty inmates, 90% male, 54% aged 31-50 years, 70% awaiting trial, completed a battery of tests including the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), the Symptom Questionnaire (SQ), and the Psychological Well-Being Scales (PWBS). Results. Cluster analysis revealed three distinct clusters of respondents, which presents varying combination of PTSD symptoms, as measured with the three subscales of the DTS. Accordingly, these clusters were labeled Cluster 1 - Traumatized (n=18), Cluster 2 - Non-traumatized (n=18), and Cluster 3 - Seriously traumatized (n=14). Findings indicated that the three groups differed consistently across all the domains of the SQ and on the environmental mastery scale of the PWBS.Those in the Traumatized clusters, as compared to the Nontraumatized, demonstrated higher overall psychological distress and lower perceived environmental mastery. Moreover, independent of posttraumatic level, inmates showed poorer psychological wellbeing and higher distress than the normative population. Discussion. The patterns manifested in clusters 1 and 3 could become the focus of attention to deliver specific intervention aimed at reducing inmates' distress and encouraging their adjustment to prison life.

AB  - Acute stress disorder (ASD) was introduced into the DSM-IV to recognize early traumatic responses and as a precursor of PTSD. Although the diagnostic criteria for ASD were altered and structured more similarly to the PTSD definition in DSM-5, only the PTSD diagnosis includes a dissociative subtype. Emerging research has indicated that there also appears to be a highly symptomatic subtype for ASD. However, the specific nature of the subtype is currently unclear. The present study investigates the possible presence of ASD subtypes in a mixed sample of victims meeting caseness for DSM-5 ASD based on self-report following four different types of traumatic exposure (N=472). The results of latent profile analysis revealed a 5-class solution. The highly symptomatic class was marked by high endorsement on avoidance and dissociation compared to the other classes. Findings are discussed in regard to its clinical implications including the implications for the pending the ICD-11 and the recently released DSM-5.

AB  - Psychiatric disturbance is common and disabling after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Few studies have investigated the trajectory of psychiatric symptoms in the first 6 months postinjury, when monitoring and early treatment might prevent persistent difficulties. The aim of this study was to examine the trajectory of psychiatric symptoms 1-6 months post-TBI, the patient/injury characteristics associated with changes, and characteristics predictive of persisting symptoms. A secondary analysis was performed on data from a clinical trial with three data collection points. Across eight centers, 872 participants with complicated mild to severe TBI were administered the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) at 30, 90, and 180 days postinjury. Mixed-effects models were used to assess longitudinal changes in the BSI Global Severity Index (GSI). Multi-variate logistic regression was used to assess predictors of clinically significant GSI elevations persisting to 6 months post-TBI. In general, GSI scores improved over time. Women improved faster than men; race/ethnicity was also significantly associated with rate of change, with Hispanics showing the most and African Americans the least improvement. Clinically significant psychiatric symptoms (caseness) occurred in 42% of the sample at 6 months, and more than one type of symptom was common. Significant predictors of caseness included African American race, age from 30 to 60 years, longer post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) duration, pre-TBI unemployment, and pre-TBI risky alcohol use. Findings indicate that psychiatric symptoms are common in the first 6 months post-TBI and frequently extend beyond the depression and anxiety symptoms that may be most commonly screened. Patients with longer PTA and preinjury alcohol misuse may need more intensive monitoring for symptom persistence. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have utilized latent class analysis (LCA) and latent profile analysis (LPA) to examine posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom profiles in a range of populations. Further study is needed to explore symptom profiles among women exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV). The current study examined latent symptom profiles in a sample of IPV-exposed women, and explored trauma-related cognitive appraisals associated with these PTSD symptom presentations. METHODS: An LPA was conducted using cross-sectional data from a non-treatment seeking community sample of women recruited following a police-reported incident of IPV by a male perpetrator (N=229). Multinomial regression analyses determined associations between latent profile membership and trauma-related appraisals. RESULTS: The LPA identified five PTSD symptom profiles: Low Symptom (46% of the sample); Low Symptom with High Hypervigilance (17%); Intermediate Symptom (16%); Intermediate Symptom with High Hypervigilance (11%); and High Symptom (10%). Trauma-related appraisals, including fear, alienation, and self-blame, were the strongest independent predictors of PTSD symptom profile membership. LIMITATIONS: The study focused on female victims of IPV by a male partner, and findings may not generalize to other gender configurations (e.g. same-sex couples, male victims, etc.). The LPA is cross-sectional, and the stability of these profiles over time warrants further study. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the need for careful consideration of differences among IPV-exposed women within the larger context of PTSD research and clinical intervention. Identifying latent subgroups may provide an empirical basis for practitioners to design and implement PTSD intervention efforts that are tailored to specific symptom profiles.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Following child trauma, parents are at risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), either owing to their direct involvement or from hearing of their child's involvement. Despite the potential impact of a parent's development of PTSD on both the parent and child, little is known about what may place a parent at increased risk. METHOD: PTSD symptoms were assessed </=4 weeks, 6 months, and 3 years post-trauma, along with a range of potential risk factors, in a sample of parents of 2-10-year-old children who were involved in a motor vehicle collision. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Two symptom trajectories were identified: Those parents whose symptoms remained low across all time points and those whose symptoms remained elevated at 6 months post-trauma and declined by 3 years. Subjective threat, thought suppression, and maladaptive cognitions about damage to the child were identified as key predictors of poorer outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic testing for hereditary colorectal cancer (HCRC) had significant psychological consequences for test recipients. This prospective longitudinal study investigated the factors that predict psychological resilience in adults undergoing genetic testing for HCRC. METHODS: A longitudinal study was carried out from April 2003 to August 2006 on Hong Kong Chinese HCRC family members who were recruited and offered genetic testing by the Hereditary Gastrointestinal Cancer Registry to determine psychological outcomes after genetic testing. Self-completed questionnaires were administered immediately before (pre-disclosure baseline) and 2 weeks, 4 months and 1 year after result disclosure. Using validated psychological inventories, the cognitive style of hope was measured at baseline, and the psychological distress of depression and anxiety was measured at all time points. RESULTS: Of the 76 participating subjects, 71 individuals (43 men and 28 women; mean age 38.9 +/- 9.2 years) from nine FAP and 24 HNPCC families completed the study, including 39 mutated gene carriers. Four patterns of outcome trajectories were created using established norms for the specified outcome measures of depression and anxiety. These included chronic dysfunction (13% and 8.7%), recovery (0% and 4.3%), delayed dysfunction (13% and 15.9%) and resilience (76.8% and 66.7%). Two logistic regression analyses were conducted using hope at baseline to predict resilience, with depression and anxiety employed as outcome indicators. Because of the small number of participants, the chronic dysfunction and delayed dysfunction groups were combined into a non-resilient group for comparison with the resilient group in all subsequent analysis. Because of low frequencies, participants exhibiting a recovery trajectory (n = 3 for anxiety and n = 0 for depression) were excluded from further analysis. Both regression equations were significant. Baseline hope was a significant predictor of a resilience outcome trajectory for depression (B = -0.24, p < 0.01 for depression); and anxiety (B = -0.11, p = 0.05 for anxiety). CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest that hopefulness may predict resilience after HCRC genetic testing in Hong Kong Chinese. Interventions to increase the level of hope may be beneficial to the psychological adjustment of CRC genetic testing recipients.

AB  - Objective: To examine inter-relationships among stress due to infant appearance and behavior in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), parental role alteration stress in the NICU, depressive symptoms, state anxiety, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and daily hassles exhibited by African-American mothers of preterm infants and to determine whether there were subgroups of mothers based on patterns of psychological distress. Method: One hundred seventy-seven African-American mothers completed questionnaires on their psychological distress at enrollment during infant hospitalization and 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after term. Results: Psychological distress measures were intercorrelated. There were four latent classes of mothers: the low distress class with low scores on all measures; the high NICU-related stress class with high infant appearance and parental role stress and moderate scores on other measures; the high depressive symptoms class with high depressive symptoms and state anxiety and moderately elevated scores on NICU-related stress and posttraumatic stress symptoms; the extreme distress class with the highest means on all measures. Infants in the high stress class were sicker than infants in the other classes. The extreme distress class mothers averaged the lowest educational level. The classes differed on distress measures, worry about the child, and parenting stress through 24 months with the extreme distress class having the highest values. Conclusion: Although different types of maternal psychological distress were substantially related, there were distinct subgroups of mothers that were identifiable in the NICU. Moreover, these subgroups continued to differ on trajectories of distress and on their perceptions of the infants and parenting through 24 months after term.

AB  - Mothers of preterm infants experience significant psychological distress, with elevated levels of inter-correlated depressive, stress, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms. In a sample of racially and ethnically diverse mothers of preterm infants, we identified differing patterns of psychological distress during infant hospitalization and examined the effect of these psychological distress patterns on longitudinal trajectories of each psychological distress measure and on maternal perceptions of the child over the first year of the infant's life. Mothers of preterm infants (N=232) completed five questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, stress due to infant appearance, and stress due to parental role alteration during enrollment during the neonatal hospitalization, discharge, and at 2, 6, and 12 months of age adjusted for prematurity. Latent class analysis on the enrollment psychological distress variables allowed us to identify five sub-groups of mothers exhibiting similar patterns of psychological distress, differing primarily in degree and type: low distress, moderate distress, high NICU-related distress, high depressive and anxiety symptoms, and extreme distress. These classes continued to show different longitudinal trajectories for the psychological distress measures through 12 months corrected age. Mothers in the extreme distress class and, to a lesser degree, mothers in the high depressive and anxiety symptom class remained at risk of significant psychological distress one year after discharge and had less positive perceptions of their child (greater worry and higher perceptions of child vulnerability). In conclusion, distinctive sub-groups of mothers during hospitalization had different patterns of psychological distress throughout the 12-month period and may require different interventions in the NICU.

AB  - The present study aimed at predicting posttraumatic stress 5 and 27 years after the North Sea oil rig disaster. The predictions were based on the initial levels of stress responses and the early recovery as reported in 1980. The Posttraumatic Stress Scale (PTSS) was used at 3 measure points. From 1980, data from 69 survivors were used in latent growth modeling. Follow-up studies included 65 survivors and 85 matched unexposed oil-rig workers in 1985; and 47 and 62 in 2007. In 1985, the survivors had higher total PTSS scores and more frequent endorsements on most single PTSS-items than the comparison group. In 2007, a few single items remained different. The initial levels of stress responses and the early recovery rate predicted the long-term outcomes after 5 and 27 years. Initial screenings may be helpful in the early detection of posttraumatic stress in the very long-term perspective. (copyright) 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - This study analyzed trajectories of initial stress and long-term mental health after the 1980 North Sea oil rig disaster. A growth-mixture model of the survivors' stress manifestations in the first 8 weeks (Posttraumatic Stress Scale, [PTSS-10]) and general mental health in 1980, 1981, 1985, and 2007 (General Health Questionnaire, [GHQ-20]) was estimated. Survivors' GHQ-scores in 1985 and 2007 were contrasted to those of a comparison group. Four trajectories were identified among survivors. The resilient (n = 43) displayed initially moderate stress that rapidly declined. The recovery (n = 10), chronic (n = 8), and relapse (n = 9) showed initially stable high stress scores, but the long-term mental health differed. Early screening may identify those at long-term risk.

AB  - Background We investigated the distinct longitudinal trajectories of posttraumatic stress symptoms in a sample of 167 children, who witnessed death of two mothers of their schoolmates. Methods: The cohort was followed-up at 2 days (T1), 2 months (T2), 6 months (T3), and 30 months (T4) after the traumatic event. The children's posttraumatic stress symptoms (T1-T4), depression (T1, T3 and T4), state anxiety (T1, T3 and T4), and quality of life (T4) were assessed, along with parental stress related to child rearing (T4). Different trajectory patterns of the children's posttraumatic stress symptoms were identified using growth mixture modeling (GMM). Results: Four different patterns of symptom change were identified, which were consistent with the prototypical model, and were named Recovery (19.9%), Resilience (72.7%), Chronic Dysfunction (1.8%), and Delayed Reactions (5.6%). Significant differences were found in depression and anxiety scores, children's quality of life, and parental rearing stress according to the distinct longitudinal trajectories of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Conclusions The present study suggests that individual differences should be taken into account in the clinical course and outcome of children exposed to psychological trauma. The two most common trajectories were the Resilience and the Recovery types, together suggesting that over 90% of children were evidenced with a favorable 30-month outcome. The latent classes were associated with significant mean differences in depression and anxiety scores, supporting the clinical validity of the distinct trajectories.

AB  - Objective: This study investigated trajectories of psychological distress and their relationships with change in psychosocial resources in the year following cancer diagnosis. Design: Chinese colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (n = 234) were assessed within 12 weeks of diagnosis (T1) and again at 3-month (T2) and 12-month (T3) follow-ups. Growth mixture modeling was used to analyze the longitudinal data. Main Outcome Measures: Psychological distress was measured at the three time-points using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: Growth mixture models identified four classes: chronic distress (7-9%), delayed distress (10-13%), recovery (13-16%), and resilient (65-67%). People in chronic distress were more likely to demonstrate loss in physical functioning and social relational quality than those in delayed distress, and loss in physical functioning, optimism, and hope than those in recovery, but more likely to demonstrate stability/gain in optimistic personalities than those in delayed distress and resilient. People in resilient were more likely to report stability/gain in optimistic personalities than those in delayed distress but not those in recovery. Conclusion: Understanding differential outcome trajectories and associated change in coping resources has implications for developing ongoing psychological services for cancer patients during the diagnosis and treatment process. © 2010 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Exposure to traumatic events has been implicated in the onset and development of a range of psychiatric disorders. People can be exposed to multiple traumatic events and previous research suggests that traumatic experiences may cluster at the individual level. This study aimed to examine the distribution of traumatic experiences in a large nationally representative sample using latent class analysis, and estimate the relationship between these classes and a number of demographic and clinical variables. Data from the National Comorbidity Survey was used. Four latent classes, each representative of a range of traumatic experiences were identified. The classes were labelled 'high risk' (class 1), 'exposure to non-sexual adult interpersonal/non-interpersonal trauma' (class 2), 'intermediate risk/sexual abuse' (class 3), and 'low risk' (class 4). Each of the latent classes was predicted by several of the demographic variables. In addition, membership of classes 1, 2, and 3 increased the risk of each of the clinical variables. The findings have clinical implications for the assessment of trauma histories across a range of psychiatric diagnoses.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Identified patterns of connectedness in youth with cancer and demographically similar healthy peers. METHOD: Participants included 153 youth with a history of cancer and 101 youth without a history of serious illness (8-19 years). Children completed measures of connectedness, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and benefit-finding. Parents also reported on children's PTSS. RESULTS: Latent profile analysis revealed four profiles: high connectedness (45%), low connectedness (6%), connectedness primarily to parents (40%), and connectedness primarily to peers (9%). These profiles did not differ by history of cancer. However, profiles differed on PTSS and benefit-finding. Children highly connected across domains displayed the lowest PTSS and highest benefit-finding, while those with the lowest connectedness had the highest PTSS, with moderate PTSS and benefit-finding for the parent and peer profiles. CONCLUSION: Children with cancer demonstrate patterns of connectedness similar to their healthy peers. Findings support connectedness as a possible mechanism facilitating resilience and growth.

AB  - To date, most studies of chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) development after trauma/stress exposure have focused on pain symptoms alone or the association of CMP with one or two other outcomes. In contrast, individuals often experience post-traumatic pain symptoms as part of a broader constellation of psychological and somatic symptoms. In this study we evaluated how trajectories of pain symptoms, depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and somatic symptoms (often termed ''post-concussive'' (PC)) cluster over time after motor vehicle collision (MVC) in a large cohort of adult European Americans who presented to the ED within 24 hours of MVC. Study participants were interviewed in the ED at the time of initial presentation and six weeks, six months, and one year following MVC. Outcome evaluations at each timepoint included an assessment of pain (0-10 NRS, Regional Pain Scale), depressive symptoms (CES-D), PTSD symptoms (IES-R), and PC symptoms (Rivermead Questionnaire). Follow-up assessments of enrolled patients (n = 948) were completed in 859 (91%), 840 (89%), and 861 (91%) participants at six weeks, six months, and one year, respectively. Exploratory factor analysis identified four correlated factors (PTSD, depressive, pain, and somatic symptoms) with high internal consistency and reliability and consistent structure over time. Individual trajectories for each factor were estimated, and K-means cluster analysis performed using trajectory intercepts found that a 4-cluster solution provided the best fit to the data. These four clusters were: globally resilient; mildly symptomatic with symptoms of depression and PTSD more prominent; extreme symptoms across all four categories with somatic and pain symptoms somewhat more prominent; and mild somatic symptoms with pain, depressive, and PTSD symptoms. These results indicate that CMP after MVC do not develop in isolation, and identify several common patterns of somatic and psychological symptoms associated with post-MVC CMP.

AB  - Background: Mental health consequences of disasters are frequently studied. However, few studies have investigated symptom improvement in victims after natural disasters. This study aimed to identify predictors of 6 months post-disaster stress symptoms and to study 6 months and 24 months course of symptoms among Norwegian tourists who experienced the 2004 tsunami. Methods: Norwegian tourists (≥18 years) who experienced the 2004 tsunami (n = 2468) were invited to return a postal questionnaire at two points of time. The first data set was collected at 6 months (T1, n = 899) and the second data set at 24 months post-disaster (T2, n = 1180). The population studied consisted of those who responded at both assessments (n = 674). Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) was used to measure posttraumatic stress symptoms. IES-R score ≥33 (caseness) was used to identify various symptom trajectories from T1 to T2. Multiple linear regression was used to determine predictors of posttraumatic stress at T1 and to identify variables associated with symptom improvement from T1 to T2. Results: The majority was identified as non-case at both assessments (57.7%), while 20.8% of the respondents were identified as case at both assessments. Symptoms at T1 were positively related to female gender, older age, unemployment, being chased or caught by the waves, witnessing death or suffering, loss of loved ones, experiencing intense fear during the disaster, low conscientiousness, neuroticism and low levels of social support. The IES-R sum score declined from 24.6 (SD = 18.5) at T1 to 22.9 (SD = 18.3) at T2, p < 0.001. Emotional stability and high IES-R scores at T1 were positively related to symptom improvement, while received social support was not. Being referred to a mental health specialist was negatively related to symptom improvement. Conclusions: A significant minority (20-30%) among Norwegian tourists developed enduring posttraumatic stress symptoms in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami. Tsunami exposure, peritraumatic fear, neuroticism and low levels of social support were the strongest predictors of posttraumatic stress at 6 months post-disaster. Decrease in posttraumatic stress was related to emotional stability and higher symptom levels at T1. Being referred to a mental health specialist did not facilitate symptom improvement. © 2013 Hussain et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Trauma exposure during childhood can lead to specific physiological, behavioral, and psychological trajectories that influence sleep and functional outcomes. The present study evaluated the relations between the timing of trauma exposures, objective REM sleep measures, subjective sleep report, and daytime Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms among a sample of combat-exposed military veterans. Methods: Participants (N=173) with a primary diagnosis of PTSD (63.0%; 42.9, [SD(plus or minus)13.0] years-old; 92.7% men), insomnia (30.6%; 36.1 [SD(plus or minus)12.4] years-old; 84.9% men), or who were healthy controls (6.4%; 28.4 [SD(plus or minus)4.0] years-old; 92.3% men) were included in this sample. Participants completed the Clinician-Administered PTSD scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the PSQI-Addendum for PTSD (to assess disruptive nocturnal behaviors), and completed overnight polysomnography. The Trauma History Questionnaire provided a retrospective account about variety of traumatic events experienced before age 18 (early-life trauma), and after age 18 (later-life trauma). Results: Early-life trauma was associated with fragmented REM sleep (r=.43, p<.001), later-life trauma (r=.28, p<.001), and daytime PTSD severity (r=.17, p<.05). Later-life trauma was associated with daytime PTSD severity (r=.47, p<.001), disruptive nocturnal behaviors (r=.32, p=.001), and sleep quality (r=.31, p<.01). Later-life trauma mediated the relations between early-life trauma and daytime PTSD severity (Sobel= 3.3, p=.001), sleep quality (Sobel=2.5, p=.01), and disruptive nocturnal behaviors (Sobel=2.5, p=.01). Conclusion: Early-life trauma exposure was associated with later-life fragmented REM sleep, but not subjective sleep measures. Early-life trauma had an indirect influence on later-life PTSD and subjective sleep disturbances. These findings suggest that early-life trauma may affect the development of sleep physiology, which may partially explain reported discrepancies between subjective and objective sleep measures in PTSD. More broadly, investigating the impact of early-life trauma exposure on sleep may provide novel insights into sleep as a mechanism for stress resilience, which may inform prevention strategies to improve functional outcomes among trauma exposed individuals.

AB  - U. S. veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan are known to have a high prevalence of traumatic brain injury (TBI), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression, which are often comorbid and share many symptoms. Attempts to describe this cohort by single diagnoses have limited our understanding of the complex nature of this population. The objective of this study was to identify subgroups of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans (IAVs) with distinct compositions of symptoms associated with TBI, PTSD, and depression. Our cross-sectional, observational study included 303,716 IAVs who received care in the Veterans Health Administration in 2010-2011. Symptoms and conditions were defined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes and symptom-clusters were identified using latent class analysis. We identified seven classes with distinct symptom compositions. One class had low probability of any condition and low health care utilization (HCU) (48 %). Other classes were characterized by high probabilities of mental health comorbidities (14 %); chronic pain and sleep disturbance (20 %); headaches and memory problems (6 %); and auditory problems (2.5 %). Another class had mental health comorbidities and chronic pain (7 %), and the last had high probabilities of most symptoms examined (3 %). These last two classes had the highest likelihood of TBI, PTSD, and depression and were identified as high healthcare utilizers. There are subgroups of IAVs with distinct clusters of symptom that are meaningfully associated with TBI, PTSD, depression, and HCU. Additional studies examining these veteran subgroups could improve our understanding of this complex comorbid patient population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The characteristics of long-term trajectories of distress after disasters are unclear, since few studies include a comparison group. This study examines trajectories of recovery among survivors in comparison to individuals with indirect exposure. METHODS: Postal surveys were sent to Swedish tourists, repatriated from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami (n=2268), at 1, 3, and 6 years after the tsunami to assess posttraumatic stress (PTS) and poor mental health. Items were used to ascertain high and moderate disaster exposure groups and an indirect exposure comparison group. RESULTS: Long-term PTS trajectories were best characterized by a resilient (72.3%), a severe chronic (4.6%), a moderate chronic (11.2%) and a recovering (11.9%) trajectory. Trajectories reported higher levels of PTS than the comparison group. Exposure severity and bereavement were highly influential risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications regarding anticipation of long-term psychological adjustment after natural disasters and need for interventions after a single traumatic event with few secondary stressors.

AB  - Long-term follow-up after disaster exposure indicates increased rates of psychological distress. However, trajectories and rates of recovery in large samples of disaster-exposed survivors are largely lacking. A group of 3457 Swedish survivors temporarily on vacation in Southeast Asia during the 2004 tsunami were assessed by postal questionnaire at 14 months and 3 years after the tsunami regarding post-traumatic stress reactions (IES-R) and general mental health (GHQ-12). There was a general pattern of resilience and recovery 3 years postdisaster. Severe exposure and traumatic bereavement were associated with increased post-traumatic stress reactions and heightened risk for impaired mental health. The rate of recovery was lower among respondents exposed to life threat and among bereaved. Severe trauma exposure and bereavement seem to have considerable long-term impact on psychological distress and appear to slow down the recovery process. Readiness among health agencies for identification of symptoms and provision of interventions might facilitate optimal recovery. (copyright) 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To discover whether post-combat syndromes have existed after modern wars and what relation they bear to each other. Design: Review of medical and military records of servicemen and cluster analysis of symptoms. Data sources: Records for 1856 veterans randomly selected from war pension files awarded from 1872 and from the Medical Assessment Programme for Gulf war veterans. Main outcome measures: Characteristic patterns of symptom clusters and their relation to dependent variables including war, diagnosis, predisposing physical illness, and exposure to combat; and servicemen's changing attributions for post-combat disorders. Results: Three varieties of post-combat disorder were identified - a debility syndrome (associated with the 19th and early 20th centuries), somatic syndrome (related primarily to the first world war), and a neuropsychiatric syndrome (associated with the second world war and the Gulf conflict). The era in which the war occurred was overwhelmingly the best predictor of cluster membership. Conclusions: All modern wars have been associated with a syndrome characterised by unexplained medical symptoms. The form that these assume, the terms used to describe them, and the explanations offered by servicemen and doctors seem to be influenced by advances in medical science, changes in the nature of warfare, and underlying cultural forces.

AB  - Methods: In a prospective, longitudinal study of Danish soldiers deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 (N = 743), we assessed community reintegration difficulties 2.5 years after home coming (study sample: N = 454). Furthermore, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed before, during, and after deployment. Trajectories of PTSD symptoms from a previously published latent growth mixture modeling analysis were used to address whether community reintegration difficulties differ as a result of course and level of PTSD symptoms. Objective: In the years following military deployment, soldiers may experience problems integrating into the community. However, little is known about the nature and prevalence of these problems and if they relate to posttraumatic symptomatology. Results: Between 3.6 and 18.0 % reported to have some, a lot, or extreme difficulties in reintegration domains such as interpersonal functioning, productivity, community involvement, and self-care. Mean level of reintegration difficulties differed significantly across six PTSD symptom trajectories (range 6.35–36.00); with more symptomatic trajectories experiencing greater community reintegration difficulties. Conclusions: Reintegration difficulties after deployment are present in less than 20 % of Danish soldiers who return from Afghanistan. Difficulties are greater in individuals who follow symptomatic PTSD trajectories in the first years following deployment than in those who follow a low-stable trajectory with no or few symptoms.

AB  - Objective: To (1) identify long-term trajectories of combat-induced posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms over a 20-year period from 1983 to 2002 in veterans with and without combat stress reaction (CSR) and (2) identify social predictors of these trajectories. Method: A latent growth mixture modeling analysis on PTSD symptoms was conducted to identify PTSD trajectories and predictors. PTSD was defined according to DSM-III and assessed through the PTSD Inventory. Israeli male veterans with (n = 369) and without (n = 306) CSR were queried at 1, 2, and 20 ears after war about combat exposure, military unit support, family environment, and social reintegration. Results: For both study groups, we identified 4 distinct trajectories with varying prevalence across groups: resilience (CSR = 34.4%, non-CSR = 76.5%), recovery (CSR = 36.3%, non-CSR = 10.5%), delayed onset (CSR = 8.4%, non-CSR = 6.9%), and chronicity (CSR = 20.9%, non-CSR = 6.2%). Predictors of trajectories in both groups included perception of war threat (ORs = 1.59-2.47, P values ≤ .30), and negative social reintegration (ORs = 0.24-0.51, P values ≤ .047). Social support was associated with symptomatology only in the CSR group (ORs = 0.40-0.61, P values ≤ .045), while family coherence was predictive of symptomatology in the non-CSR group (OR = 0.76, P = .015) but not in the CSR group. Conclusions: Findings confirmed heterogeneity of long-term sequelae of combat, revealing 4 trajectories of resilience, recovery, delay, and chronicity in veterans with and without CSR. Symptomatic trajectories were more prevalent for the CSR group, suggesting that acute functional impairment predicts pathological outcomes. Predictors of symptomatic trajectories included perceived threat and social resources at the family, network, and societal levels. © Copyright 2013 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) profiles were examined in 160 U.S. service members (SMs) following mild-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Participants who sustained a mild TBI had significantly higher PAI scores than those with moderate-severe TBI on eight of the nine clinical scales examined. A two-step cluster analysis identified four PAI profiles, heuristically labeled "High Distress", "Moderate Distress", "Somatic Distress," and "No Distress". Postconcussive and posttraumatic stress symptom severity was highest for the High Distress group, followed by the Somatic and Moderate Distress groups, and the No Distress group. Profile groups differed in age, ethnicity, rank, and TBI severity. Findings indicate that meaningful patterns of behavioral and personality characteristics can be detected in active duty military SMs following TBI, which may prove useful in selecting the most efficacious rehabilitation strategies.

AB  - Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are highly comorbid conditions that may arise following exposure to psychological trauma. This study examined their temporal sequencing and mutual influence using bivariate latent difference score structural equation modeling. Longitudinal data from 182 emergency room patients revealed level of depression symptom severity to be positively associated with changes in PTSD intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal over 3 time intervals, beginning shortly after the traumatic event. Higher scores on depression anticipated increases (or worsening) in PTSD symptom severity. The pattern of influence from PTSD symptom severity to change in depression symptom severity simply followed the general trend toward health and well-being. Results are discussed in terms of the dynamic interplay and associated mechanisms of posttrauma depression and PTSD symptom severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The distinct trajectories of psychological distress over the first year of the diagnosis with breast cancer (BC) and its determinants have not been explored. METHODS: 285 of 405 Chinese women receiving surgery for BC were assessed at 5-day, 1-month, 4-month, and 8-month post-surgery on measures of psychological distress, optimism, treatment decision-making (TDM) difficulties, satisfaction with treatment outcome, satisfaction with medical consultation, and physical symptom distress. Latent growth mixture modelling identified trajectories of psychological response to BC. Multinominal logistic regression compared TDM difficulties, satisfaction with treatment outcome, satisfaction with medical consultation, optimism, and physical symptom distress, by distress pattern adjusted for age, education, employment status, and stage of disease. RESULTS: Four distinct trajectories of distress were identified, namely, resilience (66%), chronic distress (15%), recovered (12%), and delayed-recovery (7%). TDM difficulties, optimism, satisfaction with consultation, and physical symptom distress predicted distress trajectories. Psychologically resilient women had less physical symptom distress at early post-surgery compared with women with other distress patterns. Compared with the resilient group, women in the recovered or chronic distress groups experienced greater TDM difficulties, whereas women in the delayed-recovery group reported greater dissatisfaction with the initial medical consultation. Women in the chronic distress group reported greater pessimistic outlook. CONCLUSION: Optimism and better early post-operative treatment outcomes predicted resilience to distress. Pre-operative interventions helping women to establish a realistic expectation of treatment outcome may minimize disappointment with treatment outcome and resultant distress, whereas post-operative rehabilitation should focus on symptom management.

AB  - Very few studies have investigated the longitudinal trajectory of depression and anxiety related symptomatology among child victims of maltreatment or among those at risk for maltreatment. The current study examined latent class trajectories of anxiety/depression symptoms in a sample of 1354 (n = 657 boys, n = 697 girls) victimized or at risk children using data collected from the Longtitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). Four trajectory groups were identified labeled low-stable, moderate-stable, moderate-increasing, and high-decreasing. This study also sought to investigate predictors of group membership. Relative to the low-stable group, membership in the three more pathological groups (i.e., moderate-stable, moderate-increasing, and high-decreasing) was predicted by a greater number of maltreatment allegations, more visits to a primary care physician for psychological issues, less perceived support by primary maternal caregiver, and lower rated popularity of the child. Implications for early identification of child maltreatment victims in primary health care settings was discussed. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background and aims: Advances in modern medicine have increasingly improved survival rates of critically ill and injured children. Evidence suggests that there is a significant risk for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) for children following admission to the Paediatric Intensive Care (PICU), however few studies have explored individual recovery patterns, especially in children. Aims: This paper identifies patterns of PTSS in children aged from 1 year following PICU admission using group-based trajectory modelling. Methods: Following IRB approval, maternal reports of child distress from the acute stage and up to 2 years post-PICU admission (n = 272) were examined to: (1) assess the prevalence of distress in the child, (2) identify symptom trajectories, and (3) identify risk factors associated with poor child mental health outcomes following PICU admission. Results: Analysis identified three distinct symptom trajectories in the children. The majority were resilient (82%). A small group had very high symptoms in the acute phase but were below the clinical cut-off after 6 months (recovery 3%). A significant group of children had clinical level symptoms that did not appear to improve over time (chronic 15%). There was no evidence of delayed onset PTSS. Child age and gender do not predict trajectory patterns. Conclusions: There is growing evidence that significant distress in the peritrauma period is linked to continuing clinical level distress symptoms which have the potential to impact on child physical recovery and long term functioning. Research into early interventions for distressed children following critical illness is a matter of urgency.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The extent of heterogeneity in response to the psychopharmacological treatment of negative symptoms is unknown. AIMS: To examine the extent of heterogeneity in response to the treatment of predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia. METHOD: Data were analyzed from three clinical trials that compared placebo or amisulpride for up to 60days. Trial participants had predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia (n=485). Heterogeneity of percentage reduction on the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) was examined with trajectory-group based modeling followed by descriptive statistics and the prediction of trajectory group membership with logistic regression modeling. Analyses were repeated separately for the placebo and amisulpride groups. RESULTS: Trajectory group-based modeling identified groups of non- (n=297, 61.2%), gradual-moderate (n=135, 27.8%) and rapid- (n=53, 10.9%) responders. At baseline compared to non-responders, rapid-responders had consistently significantly (p<.05) higher SANS total and subscale scores. Percent SANS improvement at endpoint was greatest for the rapid-responders group, a finding that replicated stratifying by placebo and amisulpride treatment groups. Similarly, in the total sample and stratifying by placebo and amisulpride groups, dropout was not significantly associated with trajectory group membership. CONCLUSIONS: Trajectories of treatment response to the psychopharmacological medication of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia demonstrate substantial heterogeneity. Approximately half of the patients included in our analysis showed little improvement, and the most severely ill at baseline responded the most.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examines broad-based psychopathology in a community sample of female survivors of interpersonal trauma. The extent to which facets of emotion regulation predict symptom presentation among this population is examined. METHOD: Hierarchical cluster analysis examining symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, somatization, and alcohol abuse was used to identify symptom clusters in an ethnically diverse sample (N = 205). RESULTS: Approximately 17% of the sample fell into a severe symptom group characterized by clinical levels of distress across all four disorders. The largest group (46%) was marked by subclinical distress across all four disorders, while the final group (37%) reported subclinical distress, but with a relative absence of alcohol abuse. Of the 6 emotion regulation subscales from the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (Gratz & Roemer, 2004), 2 consistently predicted group membership: nonacceptance and impulsivity. CONCLUSIONS: Cluster analyses revealed symptom clusters that may vary in their appropriateness for current posttrauma interventions. Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose was to examine the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in parents of children with cancer from shortly after diagnosis up to 5 years after end of treatment or a child's death. The study aimed to distinguish distinct landmarks important for parents' adjustment by assessment of the effect of time since significant events such as diagnosis, treatment cessation, and a child's death. METHOD: A longitudinal design covering seven assessments (T1-T7) was used. The assessments were linked to key events rather than merely to time since diagnosis. T1-T3 were administered in relation to diagnosis during treatment and the following in relation to treatment cessation (T4-T7) or a child's death (T5-T7). Parents (N = 259 at T1) were assessed for PTSS and full/partial PTSD using the self-report questionnaire PTSD Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C). Latent growth curve modeling and McNemar's test were used to assess development of PTSS over time and prevalence of PTSD after end of treatment/a child's death. RESULTS: Initial levels of PTSS were high however a subsequent decline was confirmed with a significant linear and quadratic slope between T1 and T4. The decline abated with time and was non-significant from three months after treatment cessation. The immediate time after end of treatment deviated from the overall growth with a substantially higher level. At T7, 19% of mothers and 8% of fathers reported levels indicative of at least partial PTSD. Bereaved parents reported a higher level of PTSS/ PTSD. For bereaved mothers, the prevalence of PTSD decreased with time and was at T7 equal to the prevalence among mothers of survivors. CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm that the initial high level of PTSS among parents decreases with time up to three months after treatment cessation. After this time a stable state enters. A subgroup of parents continues to report a clinically relevant level of PTSS five years after end of treatment. The results reveal that the time directly after end of treatment is an important landmark with a substantially higher level of PTSS/PTSD compared to the overall development pattern. The level of PTSS and the prevalence of PTSD was high following bereavement, pointing to the traumatic implication of losing a child to cancer. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: The application of PTSS/PTSD has been questioned for populations exposed to serious illness. Our findings underscore that the phenomena captures symptoms that parents experience and show that posttraumatic stress provides a useful framework for the conceptualization of the psychological sequelae experienced by parents of children with cancer. The design does not capture the immediate time preceding treatment cessation. There may be unique elements of parents' experiences in relation to treatment cessation that warrant further study. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: We identified a subgroup of parents for whom time does not heal the wounds created by a child's cancer disease. Intervention trials focusing on psychological functioning and targeting this subgroup are warranted. The immediate time after end of a child's cancer treatment appears as psychologically demanding for parents and should be considered in the clinical care. In addition, findings indicate that bereaved fathers may be at risk for long-term psychological sequelae.

AB  - Over the past ten years interventions utilizing an integrated model of treatment for co-occurring PTSD and SUD in women have emerged to address the links between trauma and addiction. The current study applied a longitudinal, dynamic lens to 353 women dually diagnosed with SUD and PTSD in an effort to classify common trajectories of substance use during the first 12 months following treatment. As a secondary analysis of the largest behavioral trial to date for the concurrent treatment of PTSD and SUD in women (Hien et al., 2009), the present study utilized latent growth mixture models (LGMM) with multiple groups to estimate substance use patterns after treatment in order to further clarify the phenomenon of recovery for traumatized substance users. Results from the growth mixture analyses provided support for three distinct trajectories of use and recovery in the post-treatment year. Findings highlight the necessity of accounting for heterogeneity in post-treatment substance use and the relevance of incorporating methodologies like LGMM when evaluating treatment outcomes.

AB  - Aims: High rates of relapse, heterogeneity, and nonlinearity in substance/alcohol use following treatment have underscored the need for clinical research to examine longitudinal trajectories of growth or decline. The present study evaluated the trajectories of substance/alcohol use in the 12 months following treatment in a sample of 353 women with co-occurring substance use disorders (SUDs) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A second, related aim was the exploration of associations between common trajectories and risk factors, treatment response, and post-treatment behaviors. Methods: Study re-analyzed data from the largest randomized, multi-site clinical trial to date for co-occurring SUDs and PTSD in women (National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network “Women and Trauma Study”). We utilized latent growth mixture models (LGMM) with multiple groups to estimate substance and alcohol use trajectories of 353 women with comorbid PTSD and SUDs who received six session of either Seeking Safety or Women's Health Education in addition to substance abuse treatment. LGMM was then employed to identify variables significantly associated with membership in each trajectory class. Results: LGMM analyses indicated the best fit model to consist of three distinct use patterns in the year following treatment: (1) a “light use” group (54.5%) with low likelihood and low frequency of use; (2) a “lapsing” group (23.6%) with high likelihood and low frequency; (3) a “relapsing” group (21.9%) with high likelihood and high frequency. PTSD treatment response, age, and follow up care were associated with specific trajectories. Conclusions: Study marks the first application of LGMM to investigate post-treatment substance/alcohol use trajectories in women with co-occurring PTSD and SUDs. Findings supported a 3-class trajectory model. Findings highlight the necessity of accounting for heterogeneity in post-treatment substance/alcohol use and the relevance of incorporating methodologies like LGMM when evaluating treatment outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Despite advances towards integration of care for women with co-occurring substance use disorder (SUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), low abstinence rates following SUD/PTSD treatment remain the norm. The utility of investigating distinct substance use trajectories is a critical innovation in the detection and refining of effective interventions for this clinical population.
DESIGN AND METHODS: The present study reanalysed data from the largest randomised clinical trial to date for co-occurring SUD and PTSD in women (National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network; Women and Trauma Study). Randomised participants (n = 353) received one of two interventions in addition to treatment as usual for SUD: (i) trauma-informed integrative treatment for PTSD/SUD; or (ii) an active control psychoeducation course on women's health. The present study utilised latent growth mixture models (LGMM) with multiple groups to estimate women's substance use patterns during the 12-month follow-up period.
RESULTS: Findings provided support for three different trajectories of substance use in the post-treatment year: (i) consistently low likelihood and use frequency; (ii) consistently high likelihood and use frequency; and (iii) high likelihood and moderate use frequency. Covariate analyses revealed improvement in PTSD severity was associated with membership in a specific substance use trajectory, although receiving trauma-informed treatment was not. Additionally, SUD severity, age and after-care efforts were shown to be related to trajectory membership.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the necessity of accounting for heterogeneity in post-treatment substance use, relevance of trauma-informed care in SUD recovery and benefits of incorporating methodologies like LGMM when evaluating SUD treatment outcomes.

AB  - Urban residents experience a wide range of traumatic events and are at increased risk of assaultive violence. Although previous research has examined trajectories of posttraumatic stress (PTS) through latent class growth analysis (LCGA) among persons exposed to the same index events (e.g., a natural disaster), PTS trajectories have not been documented among urban residents. The aims of this study were to conduct LGCA with a sample of trauma survivors from Detroit, Michigan (N = 981), and to explore predictors of trajectory membership. Participants completed three annual telephone surveys, each of which included the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist-Civilian Version. Four PTS trajectories were detected. Although the majority evidenced a trajectory of consistently few symptoms (Low: 72.5 %), 4.6 % were in a trajectory of chronic severe PTSD (High), and the remainder were in trajectories of consistently elevated, but generally subclinical, levels of PTS (Decreasing: 12.3 %; Increasing: 10.6 %). Socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., lower income), more extensive trauma history (e.g., childhood abuse), and fewer social resources (e.g., lower social support) were associated with membership in higher PTS trajectories, relative to the Low trajectory. The results suggest that efforts to reduce PTS in urban areas need to attend to socioeconomic vulnerabilities in addition to trauma history and risk for ongoing trauma exposure. © 2014 Society for Community Research and Action.

AB  - Exposure to natural disasters has been linked to a range of adverse outcomes, including mental health problems (e.g., posttraumatic stress symptoms [PTSS], depression), declines in role functioning (e.g., occupational difficulties), and physical health problems (e.g., somatic complaints). However, prior research and theory suggest that the modal postdisaster response in each of these domains is resilience, defined as low levels of symptoms or problems in a given outcome over time, with minimal elevations that are limited to the time period during the disaster and its immediate aftermath. However, the extent to which disaster survivors exhibit mental health wellness (resilience across multiple mental health conditions) or general wellness (resilience across mental health, physical health, and role functioning domains) remains unexplored. The purpose of this study was to quantify mental health and general wellness, and to examine predictors of each form of wellness, in a three-wave population-based study of Hurricane Ike survivors (N=658). Latent class growth analysis was used to determine the frequency of resilience on four outcomes (PTSS: 74.9%; depression: 57.9%; functional impairment: 45.1%; days of poor health: 52.6%), and cross-tabulations were used to determine the frequency of mental health wellness (51.2%) and general wellness (26.1%). Significant predictors of both mental health and general wellness included lower peri-event emotional reactions and higher community-level collective efficacy; loss of sentimental possessions or pets and disaster-related financial loss were negative predictors of mental health wellness, and loss of personal property was a negative predictor of general wellness. The results suggest that studies focusing on a single postdisaster outcome may have overestimated the prevalence of mental health and general wellness, and that peri-event responses, personal property loss and collective efficacy have a cross-cutting influence across multiple domains of postdisaster functioning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Longitudinal studies of posttraumatic stress (PTS) have documented environmental factors as predictors of trajectories of higher, versus lower, symptoms, among them experiences of childhood physical abuse. Although it is now well-accepted that genes and environments jointly shape the risk of PTS, no published studies have investigated genes, or gene-by-environment interactions (GxEs), as predictors of PTS trajectories. The purpose of this study was to fill this gap. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We examined associations between variants of the retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORA) gene and trajectory membership among a sample of predominantly non-Hispanic Black urban adults (N = 473). The RORA gene was selected based on its association with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the first PTSD genome wide association study. Additionally, we explored GxEs between RORA variants and childhood physical abuse history. RESULTS: We found that the minor allele of the RORA SNP rs893290 was a significant predictor of membership in a trajectory of consistently high PTS, relatively to a trajectory of consistently low PTS. Additionally, the GxE of rs893290 with childhood physical abuse was significant. Decomposition of the interaction showed that minor allele frequency was more strongly associated with membership in consistently high or decreasing PTS trajectories, relative to a consistently low PTS trajectory, among participants with higher levels of childhood physical abuse. CONCLUSION: The results of the study provide preliminary evidence that variation in the RORA gene is associated with membership in trajectories of higher PTS and that these associations are stronger among persons exposed to childhood physical abuse. Replication and analysis of functional data are needed to further our understanding of how RORA relates to PTS trajectories.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate trajectories of psychological distress among low-income, primarily unmarried and African American women who survived Hurricane Katrina (N = 386). Data were collected in the year prior to the hurricane as well as approximately 1 and 3 years thereafter. Using Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA), we detected 6 distinct trajectory groups. Over half of the participants fit into a trajectory consistent with resilience; that is, they maintained low levels of psychological distress over the course of the study, but experienced an elevation in symptoms at the first predisaster time point followed by a return to predisaster levels. The other trajectories reflected a range of psychological responses to disasters and indicated that predisaster functioning had a major influence on postdisaster psychological outcomes. Degree of exposure to hurricane-related stressors, experiences of human and pet bereavement, perceived social support, and socioeconomic status were significant predictors of trajectory group membership. Implications for research and policy are discussed. © 2013 American Orthopsychiatric Association.

AB  - Objective: Suicidal ideation in veterans is of great concern. The objective of this study is to examine how heterogeneous posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) trajectories are associated with postdeployment suicidal ideation in veterans 2.5 years postdeployment to a combat zone in Afghanistan. If PTSD trajectories are associated with postdeployment suicidal ideations, then the accumulative knowledge on what characterizes veterans falling into different PTSD trajectories may provide better opportunities for early identification of suicidal high-risk veterans. Method: In this prospective study of 743 Danish soldiers deployed to Afghanistan from February to August in 2009, we collected data at 6 time points from 6 weeks before deployment to 2.5 years after homecoming (total for this study: 456). At all assessments, the soldiers responded to a comprehensive questionnaire including measures of PTSD (measured by the PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version) and other mental and physical health variables, demographics, and social and combat-related factors. Suicidal ideation was measured by an item from the European Parasuicide Study Interview Schedule II. In a previous study based on soldiers from this cohort, we identified 6 PTSD trajectories using latent growth mixture modeling, which we have extracted and applied as independent variables in this study. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied to examine whether deployed soldiers with certain PTSD symptom trajectories were more likely to report suicidal ideation 2.5 years after homecoming. Results:Two PTSD trajectories with high PTSD symptom level 2.5 years after return were significantly associated with suicidal Ideation 2.5 years after homecoming. Thus, a relieved-worsening class, described by initial decreasing PTSD symptom levels followed by a steep increase in symptoms had higher risk of suicidal ideation (OR= 7.84; 95% CI, 1.68-36.6), which was also the case for a late-onset class (OR 5.2; 95% CI, 2.21-12.24) when compared to a low-stable class. Conclusions: Heterogeneous PTSD trajectories are associated with suicidal ideation in veterans 2.5 years after homecoming.

AB  - Studies on the long-term consequences of traumatization found different diagnostic trajectories: chronic, recovered, delayed and resilient. This distinction, however, was never studied in victims of torture or severe political persecution. We aimed to verify the trajectory classes of PTSD empirically and to analyze potential predictors of such trajectories. Former political prisoners from East Germany, first interviewed in 1995, were re-assessed fourteen years later. In 1995, retrospective symptom reports dating back to shortly after the prisoners' release dates were assessed. Predictors of the four different trajectories were divided into pre-trauma, peri-trauma, and post-trauma factors. As a result, the four long-term trajectories were validated in the current sample with the following percentages: chronic (36%), resilient (27%), recovered (26%) and delayed (11%) trajectories. Trajectories were mainly distinguished by pre- and post-traumatic factors, e.g. pre-trauma education or post-trauma disclosure opportunities. We conclude that the four long-term trajectories of trauma sequelae deserve more attention to adequately deal with survivors of severe persecution. Furthermore, the specific predictors of long-term trajectory deserve more attention for re-integration or in rehabilitation.

AB  - We estimated the temporal course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Vietnam-era veterans using a national sample of male twins with a 20-year follow-up. The complete sample included those twins with a PTSD diagnostic assessment in 1992 and who completed a DSM-IV PTSD diagnostic assessment and a self-report PTSD checklist in 2012 (n = 4,138). Using PTSD diagnostic data, we classified veterans into 5 mutually exclusive groups, including those who never had PTSD, and 4 PTSD trajectory groups: (a) early recovery, (b) late recovery, (c) late onset, and (d) chronic. The majority of veterans remained unaffected by PTSD throughout their lives (79.05% of those with theater service, 90.85% of those with nontheater service); however, an important minority (10.50% of theater veterans, 4.45% of nontheater veterans) in 2012 had current PTSD that was either late onset (6.55% theater, 3.29% nontheater) or chronic (3.95% theater, 1.16% nontheater). The distribution of trajectories was significantly different by theater service (p < .001). PTSD remains a prominent issue for many Vietnam-era veterans, especially for those who served in Vietnam.

AB  - Research increasingly indicates that prototypical trajectories of resilience, recovery, delayed, and chronic distress characterize reactions to acute adversity. However, trajectory research has been limited by the practical and methodological difficulties of obtaining pre-event and longitudinal data. In two studies, we employed a novel method in which trained interviewers provided a graphical depiction of prototypical stress trajectories to participants and asked them to select the one that best described their experience. In Study 1, self-identified trajectories from 21 high-exposure survivors of the September 11th World Trade Center attacks distinguished variation in posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms at 7 and 18 months, and were consistent with trajectories based on longitudinal outcomes and friend/relative ratings. In Study 2, we examined self-identified trajectories from 115 bereaved spouses at 1.5 to 3 years. Persons who identified a resilient trajectory, compared with recovery and chronic distress trajectories, had fewer interviewer-rated symptoms of grief, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder were rated as functioning more effectively by friends, reported higher life satisfaction, and had fewer somatic complaints. The present results provide initial evidence for the construct validity of a cross-sectional and less demanding method for identifying acute stress trajectories.

AB  - Objectives: This research identified which theoretically predicted factors (Joseph, Williams, & Yule, 1997) were associated with the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms 1 and 6 months following onset of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Predictor variables included event factors, peri-traumatic distress; and maintaining factors including coping strategies, social support, re-appraisal of event threat, and beliefs about the nature of ACS. Associations with alexithymia were also explored. Method: One hundred and fifty participants completed questionnaires in hospital and at 1- and 6-month follow-up. Results: Hierarchical multiple regression including both baseline and contemporaneous variables explained 52 and 42% of the variance in PTSD symptoms at each follow-up. At 1-month follow-up, predictors of PTSD symptoms were as follows: peri-traumatic distress, concern over symptoms, illness comprehension, and lack of social support. At 6-month follow-up, predictors were: peri-traumatic distress, lack of social support, use of problem-focused coping, and continued symptoms. Conclusions: The Joseph et al. model was generally supported. The data allow some degree of prediction of high risk individuals and suggest some possible interventions.

AB  - This study examined trajectories of posttraumatic growth or depreciation (i.e., positive or negative life change) in personal strength and relationships after 2 major earthquakes in Canterbury, New Zealand using group-based trajectory modeling. Participants completed questionnaires regarding posttraumatic growth or depreciation in personal strength and relationship domains 1 month after the first earthquake in September 2010 (N =185) and 3 months (n =156) and 12 months (n =144) after the more severe February 2011 earthquake. Three classes of growth or depreciation patterns were found for both domains. For personal strength, most of the participants were grouped into a "no growth or depreciation" class and smaller proportions were grouped into either a "posttraumatic depreciation" or "posttraumatic growth" class. The 3 classes for relationships all reported posttraumatic growth, differing only in degree. None of the slopes were significant for any of the classes, indicating that levels of growth or depreciation reported after the first earthquake remained stable when assessed at 2 time points after the second earthquake. Multinomial logistic regression analyses examining pre- and postearthquake predictors of trajectory class membership revealed that those in the "posttraumatic growth" personal strength class were significantly younger and had significantly higher pre-earthquake mental health than those in the "posttraumatic depreciation" class. Sex was the only predictor of the relationship classes: No men were assigned to the "high posttraumatic growth" class. Implications and future directions are discussed. © 2014 American Psychological Association.

AB  - This research seeks to identify profiles of adaptation among child victims of suspected maltreatment using a social-ecological framework. Data were drawn from the LONGSCAN multisite longitudinal study. Participants were 597 12-year-old children of diverse backgrounds (57% girls) with at least one Child Protective Services report of suspected maltreatment (M = 3.4 reports). Self-, caregiver-, and teacher-reports were collected to assess child competence, psychological and behavioral problems, and family and neighborhood characteristics. Latent Profile Analysis was used to classify individuals into empirically derived groups. The best-fitting model yielded five distinct profiles: consistent resilience; consistent maladaptation; posttraumatic stress problems; school maladaptation, family protection; and low socialization skills. Findings underscore the heterogeneity of child adaptation and reveal unique profiles of adaptation and contextual protection. Within-person variation in functioning suggests the need for comprehensive assessment across domains and contexts to address the clinical needs of maltreated youth.

AB  - The longitudinal course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) over 8-9 years was examined among 16,488 rescue and recovery workers who responded to the events of September 11, 2001 (9/11) at the World Trade Center (WTC; New York, NY), and were enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Registry. Latent class growth analysis identified 5 groups of rescue and recovery workers with similar score trajectories at 3 administrations of the PTSD Checklist (PCL): low-stable (53.3%), moderate- stable (28.7%), moderate-increasing (6.4%), high-decreasing (7.7%), and high-stable (4.0%). Relative to the low-stable group, membership in higher risk groups was associated with 9/11-related exposures including duration of WTC work, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.3 to 2.0, witnessing of horrific events (range = 1.3 to 2.1), being injured (range = 1.4 to 2.3), perceiving threat to life or safety (range = 2.2 to 5.2), bereavement (range = 1.6 to 4.8), and job loss due to 9/11 (range = 2.4 to 15.8). Within groups, higher PCL scores were associated with adverse social circumstances including lower social support, with B coefficients ranging from 0.2 to 0.6, divorce, separation, or widowhood (range = 0.4-0.7), and unemployment (range = 0.4-0.5). Given baseline, exposure-related, and contextual influences that affect divergent PTSD trajectories, screening for both PTSD and adverse circumstances should occur immediately, and at regular intervals postdisaster.

AB  - Psychological adjustment after a major burn injury is a significant concern to providers and patients alike. Although efforts have been made to identify associated risk factors, little is known about heterogeneity in the levels or trajectories of adjustment in this population. This study used a novel application of Growth Mixture Modeling to identify subgroups of patients based on their longitudinal self-reported distress using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Data were drawn from the database of the Burn Model Systems project, a prospective, multisite, cohort study of major burn injury survivors. The BSI was used to assess symptoms in-hospital and at 6, 12, and 24 months postburn. Participants' T scores on the BSIs Global Severity Index provided a continuous measure of psychological distress. Analyses were conducted using participants' Global Severity Index T scores to discern distinct classes of respondents with similar trajectories across the 2-year follow-up. Results from the Growth Mixture Modeling analysis produced an ordered four-class model of psychological recovery from a major burn. Groups represented the equivalent of high, subthreshold, mild, and minimal symptom severity. Covariates significantly affected the intercept and slope of each class, as well as prediction of group assignment. These analyses demonstrate differences between individual recoveries after a major burn. Psychological distress symptoms remain largely stable over time and highlight the psychological vulnerability of this patient population. © 2010 by the American Burn Association.

AB  - The current study examined associations between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and future interpersonal victimization among adolescents, after accounting for the impact of early victimization exposure, gender, ethnicity, and household income. In addition, problematic alcohol use was tested as a mediator of the relation between PTSD symptoms and subsequent victimization. Participants included a national longitudinal sample of adolescents (N = 3,604) who were ages 12 to 17 at the initial assessment: 50% were male, and 67% were White, 16% African American, and 12% Hispanic. Cohort-sequential latent growth curve modeling was used to examine associations among the study variables. Baseline PTSD symptoms significantly predicted age-related increases in interpersonal victimization, even after accounting for the effects of earlier victimization experiences. In addition, alcohol problems emerged as a partial mediator of this relation, such that one fourth to one third of the effect of PTSD symptoms on future victimization was attributable to the impact of PTSD symptoms on alcohol problems (which, in turn, predicted additional victimization risk). Collectively, the full model accounted for more than half of the variance in age-related increases in interpersonal victimization among youth. Results indicate that PTSD symptoms serve as a risk factor for subsequent victimization among adolescents, over and above the risk conferred by prior victimization. This increased risk occurred both independently and through the impact of PTSD symptoms on problematic alcohol use. Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that the likelihood of repeated victimization among youth might be reduced through early detection and treatment of these clinical problems.

AB  - Few studies have explored how different trauma experiences influence service use. This study explores patterns of service use amongst 6483 adolescents aged between 13 and 18, and examines if such patterns are associated with trauma profiles, demographic variables, and mental health disorders. Data from the National Comorbidity Survey - Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A) were used. A latent class analysis identified four adolescent trauma sub-groups: 'high risk', 'sexual risk' 'non-sexual risk', and 'low risk'. Regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between service use, trauma classes, and mental health outcomes. Significant relationships were found between service use, trauma sub-groups, demographics and mental health outcomes. Despite the effectiveness of mental health services, only a minority of adolescents exposed to different traumas use such resources. However, this study may go some way towards providing an understanding of the trauma backgrounds, demographic predictors and mental health disorders associated with service use.

AB  - Sexually abused children may have poor mental health because of their victimization as well as preexisting or co-occurring family problems. However, few studies consider psychopathology in relation to both abuse and other family experiences. This study uses data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) to create latent subgroups of 553 children investigated for sexual abuse. The study investigates children's psychological symptoms and child welfare service (CWS) patterns to understand how children's needs relate to mental health services. Analyses were conducted by child age: 3-7, 8-11, and 12-14. Factor mixture modeling and regression analyses were used. Results show meaningful subgroups of children that relate to different symptom patterns. Among 3- to 7-year-olds, behavioral symptoms are associated with caregiver domestic violence and mental illness. Among 8- to 11-year-olds, depressive symptoms are associated with severe abuse and multiple family problems, whereas posttraumatic stress is associated with chronic, unresolved abuse. Although many children received mental health services, services are not well matched to children's needs - the substantiation status of the abuse explains services. Implications for CWS and mental health services are discussed. (copyright) 2007 APA, all rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the co-occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders (SUDs) in a sample (N = 668) recruited for personality disorders and followed longitudinally as part of the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study. The study both examined rates of co-occurring disorders at baseline and temporal relationships between PTSD and substance use disorders over 4 years. Subjects with a lifetime history of PTSD at baseline had significantly higher rates of SUDs (both alcohol and drug) than subjects without PTSD. Latent class growth analysis, a relatively novel approach used to analyze trajectories and identify homogeneous subgroups of participant on the basis of probabilities of PTSD and SUD over time, identified 6 classes, which were compared with respect to a set of functioning and personality variables. The most consistent differences were observed between the group that displayed low probabilities of both SUD and PTSD and the group that displayed high probabilities of both.

AB  - Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked with neuropsychological deficits in several areas, including attention, learning and memory, and cognitive inhibition. Although memory dysfunction is among the most commonly documented deficits associated with PTSD, our existing knowledge pertains only to retrospective memory. The current study investigated the relationship between PTSD symptom severity and event-based prospective memory (PM). Method: Forty veterans completed a computerized event-based PM task, a self-report measure of PTSD, and measures of retrospective memory. Results: Hierarchical regression analysis results revealed that PTSD symptom severity accounted for 16% of the variance in PM performance, F(3, 36) = 3.47, p <.05, after controlling for age and retrospective memory. Additionally, each of the three PTSD symptom clusters was related, to varying degrees, with PM performance. Conclusions: Results suggest that elevated PTSD symptoms may be associated with more difficulties completing tasks requiring PM. Further examination of PM in PTSD is warranted, especially in regard to its impact on everyday functioning. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Attachment security contributes to resilience in times of stress, but it can be disrupted by traumatic events that shatter positive views of self and others. We followed Israeli ex-POWs of the Yom Kippur War over 17 years and examined associations between trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and disruptions in the regulatory functions of the attachment system. Fifty-nine ex-POWs and 39 control veterans from the same war who had reported on PTSD 18, 30, and 35 years after the war performed laboratory cognitive tasks assessing activation of mental representations of security in response to threat and the ability of these representations to color neutral stimuli with positive affect and reduce access to trauma-related thoughts. As compared to controls, ex-POWs with persistent PTSD over the 17-year period exhibited dramatic disruptions in the soothing and healing functions of attachment security representations. These disruptions were not evident among ex-POWs with a worsening PTSD trajectory or a stable resilience trajectory. The implications of attachment-system functioning for understanding posttraumatic processes are discussed. © 2014 Guilford Publications, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined typologies of childhood violence exposure (CVE) and the associations of profiles with current demographic characteristics and mental health in emerging adulthood. PARTICIPANTS: The study evaluated a sample of college students from 2 US geographic regions (Midwest, n = 195; Southeast, n = 200). METHODS: An online questionnaire (collected 2013-2014) assessed CVE and current mental health. Latent class analysis was used to identify typologies of CVE. Follow-up analyses were conducted to distinguish differences between typologies in demographic characteristics and mental health. RESULTS: Four distinct profiles emerged: High-Exposed, Domestic-Exposed, Community-Exposed, and Low-Exposed. High- and Domestic-Exposed groups were more likely to be first-generation college students and to experience symptoms of psychopathology. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a unique presentation of CVE profiles and a nuanced interpretation of their differential relationship to current demographic characteristics and mental health. It may befit university mental health initiatives to engage first-generation students and utilize comprehensive assessments of previous victimization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This longitudinal study classified groups of children experiencing different trajectories of student-teacher relationship quality over the transition from preschool into school, and determined the strength of the association between different student-teacher relationship trajectories and childhood mental health problems in the second year of primary school. METHODS: A community sample of 460 Australian children were assessed in preschool (age 4), the first school year (age 5), and second school year (age 6). Teachers at all three assessments reported on student-teacher relationship quality with the Student Teacher Relationship Scale. When the children were at preschool and in their second school year, parents and teachers rated children's mental health problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. RESULTS: Latent-class growth modelling identified two trajectories of student-teacher relationship quality: (1) a stable-high student-teacher relationship quality and (2) a moderate/declining student-teacher relationship quality trajectory. Generalised linear models found that after adjusting for family demographic characteristics, having a stable high quality student-teacher relationship trajectory was associated with fewer parent-rated and teacher-rated total mental health problems, and fewer conduct, hyperactivity, and peer problems, and greater prosocial behaviour at age 6. A stable high quality trajectory was also associated with fewer teacher-rated, but not parent-rated emotional symptoms. These effects remained after adjustment for levels of mental health problems at age 4. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that early intervention and prevention strategies that focus on building stable high quality student-teacher relationships during preschool and children's transition into formal schooling, may help reduce rates of childhood mental health problems during the early school years.

AB  - Schools have become a common incident site for targeted mass violence, including mass shootings. Although exposure to mass violence can result in significant distress, most individuals are able to fully recover over time, while a minority develop more pervasive pathology, such as PTSD. The present study investigated how several pre- and posttrauma factors predict posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in both the acute and distal aftermath of a campus mass shooting using a sample with known levels of pretrauma functioning (N=. 573). Although the largest proportion of participants evidenced resilience following exposure to the event (46.1%), many reported high rates of PTSS shortly after the shooting (42.1%) and a smaller proportion (11.9%) met criteria for probable PTSD both in the acute and more distal aftermath of the event. While several preshooting factors predicted heightened PTSS after the shooting, prior trauma exposure was the only preshooting variable shown to significantly differentiate between those who experienced transient versus prolonged distress. Among postshooting predictors, individuals reporting greater emotion dysregulation and peritraumatic dissociative experiences were over four times more likely to have elevated PTSS 8. months postshooting compared with those reporting less dysregulation and dissociative experiences. Individuals with less exposure to the shooting, fewer prior traumatic experiences, and greater satisfaction with social support were more likely to recover from acute distress. Overall, results suggest that, while pretrauma factors may differentiate between those who are resilient in the aftermath of a mass shooting and those who experience heightened distress, several event-level and posttrauma coping factors help distinguish between those who eventually recover and those whose PTSD symptoms persist over time. © 2014 Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies.

AB  - We examined the course of PTSD symptoms in a cohort of U.S. Marines (N = 867) recruited for the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS) from a single infantry battalion that deployed as a unit for 7 months to Afghanistan during the peak of conflict there. Data were collected via structured interviews and self-report questionnaires 1 month prior to deployment and again at 1, 5, and 8 months postdeployment. Second-order growth mixture modeling was used to disaggregate symptom trajectories; multinomial logistic regression and relative weights analysis were used to assess the role of combat exposure, prior life span trauma, social support, peritraumatic dissociation, and avoidant coping as predictors of trajectory membership. Three trajectories best fit the data: a low-stable symptom course (79%), a new-onset PTSD symptoms course (13%), and a preexisting PTSD symptoms course (8%). Comparison in a separate MRS cohort with lower levels of combat exposure yielded similar results, except for the absence of a new-onset trajectory. In the main cohort, the modal trajectory was a low-stable symptoms course that included a small but clinically meaningful increase in symptoms from predeployment to 1 month postdeployment. We found no trajectory of recovery from more severe symptoms in either cohort, suggesting that the relative change in symptoms from predeployment to 1 month postdeployment might provide the best indicator of first-year course. The best predictors of trajectory membership were peritraumatic dissociation and avoidant coping, suggesting that changes in cognition, perception, and behavior following trauma might be particularly useful indicators of first-year outcomes.

AB  - Objective: Neuropsychological studies have consistently demonstrated impaired verbal memory in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Trauma-focused treatment for PTSD is thought to rely on memory, but it is largely unknown whether treatment outcome is influenced by memory performance. The aim of the study, therefore, was to examine the relationship between verbal memory performance and treatment response to trauma-focused psychotherapy. Method: Participants were referred to our outpatient clinic and recruited between December 2003 and January 2009 upon diagnosis of PTSD according to DSM-IV. Secondary analyses of a randomized controlled trial comparing eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy (n = 70) and brief eclectic psychotherapy (n = 70), a cognitive-behavioral intervention, are reported. Response to treatment was measured by self-reported PTSD symptom severity (Impact of Event Scale - Revised) over 17 weeks. Pretreatment verbal memory measures (California Verbal Learning Test, Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test) were included in the mixed linear model analyses in order to investigate the influence of memory on treatment outcome. Results: Pretreatment encoding, short-term retrieval, long-term retrieval, and recognition performance were significantly associated with treatment response in terms of self-reported PTSD symptom severity for both treatments (P = .013). Receiver operating characteristic curves predicting treatment response with pretreatment memory indices showed that 75.6% of the patients could be correctly classified as responder. Conclusions: Poor verbal memory performance represents a risk factor for worse treatment response to trauma-focused psychotherapy. Memory measures can be helpful in determining which patients are unable to benefit from trauma-focused psychotherapy. Future research should explore how treatment perspectives of patients with poor verbal memory can be improved. © Copyright 2015 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - Questions exist regarding whether posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are unique sequelae of trauma or a manifestation of a single form of psychopathology. Using latent growth modeling, we examined the role of risk factors occurring within 48 hours of the time of trauma on the course of PTSD and MDD symptoms over an 8-month period in 163 participants recruited from a level 1 surgical trauma center. Both PTSD and MDD symptoms showed peak prevalence by 1 month and significantly decreased over 7 months. Greater postinjury pain and PTSD symptoms (measured within 48 hours of trauma) predicted higher rates of both PTSD and MDD symptoms at 1 month. Other predictors were unique to each disorder. Results suggest that PTSD and MDD are related consequences of trauma. Copyright (copyright) 2011 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.

AB  - Taking advantage of two large, population-based, and longitudinal datasets collected after the 1999 floods in Mexico (n = 561) and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York (n = 1267), we examined the notion that resilience may be best understood and measured as one member of a set of trajectories that may follow exposure to trauma or severe stress. We hypothesized that resistance, resilience, recovery, relapsing/remitting, delayed dysfunction, and chronic dysfunction trajectories were all possible in the aftermath of major disasters. Semi-parametric group-based modeling yielded the strongest evidence for resistance (no or mild and stable symptoms), resilience (initially moderate or severe symptoms followed by a sharp decrease), recovery (initially moderate or severe symptoms followed by a gradual decrease), and chronic dysfunction (moderate or severe and stable symptoms), as these trajectories were prevalent in both samples. Neither Mexico nor New York showed a relapsing/remitting trajectory, and only New York showed a delayed dysfunction trajectory. Understanding patterns of psychological distress over time may present opportunities for interventions that aim to increase resilience, and decrease more adverse trajectories, after mass traumatic events.

AB  - Trauma is associated with a range of outcomes; identification of homogeneous profiles of posttrauma symptoms may inform theory, diagnostic refinement, and intervention. The present investigation applies a novel analytic technique to the identification of homogeneous subgroups of post-traumatic symptomatology in a large sample of African American adults reporting high levels of trauma. Latent profiles of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity were tested using latent profile analysis. Pseudo-class draws were used to characterize class differences across types of trauma, diagnostic comorbidities, and clinically-relevant features. Participants consisted of 2915 highly traumatized African Americans living in low income, urban setting and recruited from medical clinics in Atlanta, GA. Findings supported the presence of six distinct subgroups of posttraumatic stress symptom profiles described as resilient, moderate with amnesia, moderate with diminished interest, moderate without diminished interest and amnesia severe without amnesia, and severe overall. Observed subgroups differed across numerous historical and concurrent factors including childhood trauma, current and lifetime diagnoses of PTSD and major depression, lifetime substance use diagnosis, dissociation, depressive symptoms, emotional dysregulation, negative and positive affect, and history of hospitalization and suicidality. Posttraumatic stress disorder as currently defined is comprised of homogeneous subgroups with important differences in posttraumatic stress symptom endorsement as well as concomitant differentiation of associated diagnoses and clinically-relevant associated features.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2010 iteration of the Global Burden of Disease statistics (Murray et al., 2012) points to the growing impact of injury and highlights the mounting burden of psychiatric disorder. It is essential to examine the intersection between these two contributors to disease burden. METHODS: The Australian Injury Vulnerability Study collected data of over 1,000 injury patients from their initial hospitalization to 6 years post-injury. Structured clinical interviews were used to diagnose psychiatric disorder and self-report measures for disability and symptom severity. RESULTS: A wide range of psychiatric disorders developed following injury, which included posttraumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia, depression, and substance use disorders (Bryant, O'Donnell, Creamer, Silove, & McFarlane, 2010). Although prevalence rates for these disorders were generally consistent over time, examination of trajectory data showed that different people had the disorders at different times. Importantly, the data showed that early anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms played a significant role in the development of long term disability after injury (Carty, O'Donnell, Evans, Kazantzis, & Creamer, 2011; O'Donnell et al., 2013). CONCLUSIONS: These data support the view that transdiagnostic models for early intervention may be required to address the complex psychiatric disorder trajectories that develop after injury.

AB  - Objective: The first aim of this work was to conduct a rigorous longitudinal study to identify rates of delayed-onset posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a sample of patients with severe injury. The second aim was to determine what variables differentiated delayed-onset PTSD from chronic PTSD. Methods: Randomly selected patients with injury who were admitted to four hospitals around Australia were recruited to the study (N = 834) and assessed in the acute care hospital, at 3 months, and at 12 months. A structured clinical interview was used to assess PTSD at each time point. Results: Seventy-three patients (9%; n = 73) had PTSD at 12 months. Of these, 39 (53%) were classified as having delayed-onset PTSD. Furthermore, 22 (56%) patients with delayed-onset PTSD had minimal PTSD symptoms at 3 months (i.e., they did not have partial/subsyndromal PTSD at 3 months). The variables that differentiated delayed-onset PTSD from chronic PTSD were greater injury severity (odds ratio [OR] = 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-1.26), lower anxiety severity at 3 months (OR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.61-0.87), and greater pain severity at 3 months (OR = 1.39; 95% CI = 1.06-1.84). Conclusions: Delayed-onset PTSD occurred frequently in this sample. Approximately half of the patients with delayed-onset PTSD had minimal PTSD symptoms at 3 months; therefore, their delayed-onset PTSD could not be accounted for by a small number of fluctuating symptoms. As we move toward DSM-V, it is important that research continues to explore the factors that underpin the development of delayed-onset PTSD. © 2013 by the American Psychosomatic Society.

AB  - PURPOSE: Risk factors for children's development are multifarious and co-occur, having cumulative as well as individual impacts. Yet common configurations of early childhood risks remain little understood. The current study aimed to identify patterns of early risk exposure and to examine their relationship with diverse outcomes in middle childhood.
METHODS: Using latent class analysis in a large, community-based, UK sample (N = 13,699), we examined 13 putative risk factors to identify patterns of exposure.
RESULTS: Four risk configurations were identified: low (65 %), socio-demographic (14 %), family dysfunction (12 %), and multiple (9 %) risk classes. As expected, children in the low risk group fared best on all outcome measures, and those with multiple risk, worst. Importantly, specificity in associations with outcomes emerged, such that cognitive outcomes were predominantly linked with socio-demographic adversities, emotional difficulties with family dysfunction, and conduct problems increased across risk classes.
CONCLUSIONS: Better understanding of configurations of childhood risk exposures may help to target resources for children in need.

AB  - In a sample with known levels of preshooting posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms, we examined the impact of a campus mass shooting on trajectories of PTS in the 31 months following the shooting using latent growth mixture modeling. Female students completed 7 waves of a longitudinal study (sample sizes ranged from 812 to 559). We identified 4 distinct trajectories (n = 660): (a) minimal impact-resilience (60.9%), (b) high impact-recovery (29.1%), (c) moderate impact-moderate symptoms (8.2%), and (d) chronic dysfunction (1.8%). Individuals in each trajectory class remained at or returned to preshooting levels of PTS approximately 6 months postshooting. The minimal impact-resilience class reported less prior trauma exposure (η2 = .13), less shooting exposure (η2 = .07), and greater emotion regulation skills than all other classes (η2 &gt; .30). The chronic dysfunction class endorsed higher rates of experiential avoidance prior to the shooting than the minimal-impact resilient and high impact-recovery classes (η2 = .15), as well as greater shooting exposure than the high impact-recovery class (η2 = .07). Findings suggest that preshooting functioning and emotion regulation distinguish between those who experience prolonged distress following mass violence and those who gradually recover. © 2014 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.

AB  - The goal of this study was to examine the developmental trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, in a sample of acutely injured hospitalized civilian trauma survivors who participated in a randomized controlled trial. Prior research has shown that there are distinct trajectories of Posttraumatic Stress symptoms over time in trauma survivors and four prototypical outcome trajectories after loss or trauma have been described: resilience, recovery, delayed, and chronic trajectories (Bonanno, 2004). Studies have shown that seriously injured trauma-exposed patients who require extended inpatient hospital care may be at the highest risk for PTSD development. However, limited information has been provided not only regarding the patterns of the trajectories for this population, but for the risk factors that influence the trajectories as well. Semiparametric, group based approach (SGBA) trajectory modeling was used to examine four group trajectories of archival data obtained from a previous study of a stepped care intervention. Data evaluating PTSD from the Posttraumatic Checklist - Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale (CAPS) measures were used for the SGBA trajectory modeling. Risk factor assessment was conducted by contrasting the probability of membership in the recovery, delayed, and chronic trajectory groups to the probability of membership in the resilience trajectory group. The risk factors of minority racial status, psychiatric history, additional life stressors, general mental health, alcohol abuse or dependence, and depression were found to significantly affect the probability of trajectory membership for PTSD symptom severity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the longitudinal trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a sample of acutely injured hospitalized civilian trauma survivors who participated in a randomized clinical trial. Prior longitudinal descriptive research has shown that there are distinct trajectories of PTSD symptoms over time in trauma survivors. Limited clinical trial research exists that describes the patterns of the trajectories as well as the risk factors that influence the trajectories for seriously injured trauma-exposed patients. METHOD: Semiparametric, group-based approach trajectory modeling was used to examine four group trajectories of a subset of data obtained from a previous longitudinal clinical trial. Trajectories examined included resilience, recovery, relapsing/remitting, and chronic symptom patterns. One hundred and ninety-four patients who participated in the randomized clinical trial were assessed at baseline in the days and weeks after injury and then randomized. The associations between previously identified PTSD risk factors and the four trajectories were examined. RESULTS: The risk factors of ethnocultural minority status, psychiatric history, additional life stressors, and depressive symptoms, as well as intervention versus control group status, were found to significantly affect the probability of trajectory group membership for PTSD symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that there is a need for early PTSD interventions that anticipate differences in injured patients' PTSD trajectory profiles. Stepped care intervention procedures may optimally address the diverse PTSD trajectory patterns observed in injured trauma survivors through the tailoring of intervention timing and dosing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Theorists and researchers have demonstrated multiple trajectories of symptoms following disasters (Ecology and Society, 13, 2008, 9), highlighting the importance of obtaining more knowledge about exposed youth who demonstrate resilience as well as those who suffer chronic difficulties. This paper examines trajectories of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following exposure to hurricanes and the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill to increase understanding of resilience and chronic reactions to both natural and technological disasters. METHODS: A multiwave longitudinal design was used to follow N = 4,619 youth who were evaluated for PTSD symptoms, hurricane exposure, and oil spill exposure/stress at four time points over a period of 4 years. Trajectories were identified with cluster analyses and multilevel modeling. RESULTS: Individual trajectories were statistically identified consistent with theory. The largest group exhibited stable-low symptoms (52%), a second group showed steep declines following initial symptoms (21%), a third group exhibited increasing symptoms (18%), and a fourth group showed stable-high symptoms (9%). Both hurricane exposure and oil spill stress predicted trajectories and overall levels of PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results identified an effect of oil spill stress and hurricane exposure on symptom levels and trajectories of exposed youth. Results provide prospective data to support theories of multiple symptom trajectories following disasters and reinforce the importance of research that utilizes a developmental perspective to consider the long-term effects of disasters in youth. Findings highlight the importance of identifying symptoms and predictors of resilience as well as factors that contribute to resilience.

AB  - Objective: To identify prospective predictors of mental health in Kabul, Afghanistan. Method: Using stratified random-sampling in schools, mental health and life events for 11-to 16-year-old students and their caregivers were assessed. In 2007, 1 year after baseline, the retention rate was 64% (n = 115 boys, 119 girls, 234 adults) with no evidence of selection bias. Self- and caregiver-rated child mental health (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), depressive (Depression Self-Rating Scale), and posttraumatic stress (Child Revised Impact of Events Scale) symptoms and caregiver mental health (Self-Report Questionnaire) were assessed. Lifetime trauma and past-year traumatic, stressful, and protective experiences were assessed. Results: With the exception of posttraumatic stress, one-year trajectories for all mental health outcomes showed significant improvement (p < .001). Family violence had a striking impact on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire data, raising caregiver-rated scores by 3.14 points (confidence interval [CI] 2.214.08) or half a standard deviation, and self-rated scores by 1.26 points (CI 0.502.03); past-year traumatic beatings independently raised self-rated scores by 1.85 points (CI 0.033.66). A major family conflict raised depression scores by 2.75 points (CI 0.894.61), two thirds of a standard deviation, whereas improved family life had protective effects. Posttraumatic stress symptom scores, however, were solely contingent on lifetime trauma, with more than three events raising scores by 5.38 points (CI 1.769.00). Conclusions: Family violence predicted changes in mental health problems other than posttraumatic stress symptoms in a cohort that showed resilience to substantial socioeconomic and war-related stressors. The importance of prospectively identifying impacts of specific types of childhood adversities on mental health outcomes is highlighted to strengthen evidence on key modifiable factors for intervention in war-affected populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies of war-affected youth have not yet examined how trauma memories relate to prospective changes in mental health and to subjective or social experiences. METHODS: We interviewed a gender-balanced, randomly selected sample of Afghan child-caregiver dyads (n = 331, two waves, 1 year apart). We assessed lifetime trauma with a Traumatic Event Checklist, past-year events with a checklist of risk and protective events, and several child mental health outcomes including posttraumatic distress (Child Revised Impact of Events Scale, CRIES) and depression. We examined the consistency of trauma recall over time, identified mental health trajectories with latent transition modeling, and assessed the predictors of posttraumatic distress and depression trajectories with multinomial logistic regressions. RESULTS: From baseline to follow-up, reports of lifetime trauma significantly changed (p </= 0.01). A third of the cohort reported no trauma exposure; only 10% identified the same event as their most distressing experience. We identified four CRIES trajectories: low or no distress (52%), rising distress (15%), declining distress (21%), and sustained high distress (12%). Youth with chronic posttraumatic distress were more likely to be girls (OR = 5.78, p </= 0.01), report more trauma exposure at baseline (OR = 1.55, p </= 0.05) and follow-up (OR = 5.96, p </= 0.01), and experience ongoing domestic violence (OR = 4.84, p </= 0.01). The risks of rising distress and sustained distress showed a steady increase for youth recalling up to four traumatic experiences. Depression and CRIES trajectories showed weak comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Memories of violent events are malleable, embedded in social experiences, and present heterogeneous associations with posttraumatic distress. Our study provides insights on resilience and vulnerability to multiple adverse childhood experiences, highlighting research and clinical implications for understanding trauma in conflict-affected youth.

AB  - Objectives: This study used longitudinal, narrative data to identify trajectories of recovery among homeless adults with mental illness alongside the factors that contribute to positive, negative, mixed or neutral trajectories over time. We expected that participants who received Housing First (HF) would describe more positive trajectories of recovery than those who were assigned to Treatment as Usual (TAU; no housing or support provided through the study). Design: Narrative interview data were collected from participants at baseline and 18 months after random assignment to HF or TAU. Setting: Participants were sampled from the community in Vancouver, British Columbia. Participants: Fifty-four participants were randomly and purposively selected from the larger trial; 52 were interviewed at baseline and 43 were reinterviewed 18 months after randomisation. Method: Semistructured interviews were conducted at both time points. For each participant, paired baseline and follow-up narratives were classified as positive, negative, mixed or neutral trajectories of recovery, and thematic analysis was used to identify the factors underlying different trajectories. Results: Participants assigned to HF (n=28) were generally classified as positive or mixed trajectories; those assigned to TAU (n=15) were generally classified as neutral or negative trajectories. Positive trajectories were characterised by a range of benefits associated with good-quality, stable housing (eg, reduced substance use, greater social support), positive expressions of identity and the willingness to self-reflect. Negative, neutral and mixed trajectories were characterised by hopelessness ('things will never get better') related to continued hardship (eg, eviction, substance use problems), perceived failures and loss. Conclusions: HF is associated with positive trajectories of recovery among homeless adults with mental illness. Those who did not receive housing or support continued to struggle across a wide range of life domains. Findings are discussed with implications for addressing services and broader social change in order to benefit this marginalised population.

AB  - Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf Coast of the United States in August 2005, exposed area residents to trauma and extensive property loss. However, little is known about the long-run effects of the hurricane on the mental health of those who were exposed. This study documents long-run changes in mental health among a particularly vulnerable group-low income mothers-from before to after the hurricane, and identifies factors that are associated with different recovery trajectories. Longitudinal surveys of 532 low-income mothers from New Orleans were conducted approximately one year before, 7-19 months after, and 43-54 months after Hurricane Katrina. The surveys collected information on mental health, social support, earnings and hurricane experiences. We document changes in post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), as measured by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and symptoms of psychological distress (PD), as measured by the K6 scale. We find that although PTSS has declined over time after the hurricane, it remained high 43-54 months later. PD also declined, but did not return to pre-hurricane levels. At both time periods, psychological distress before the hurricane, hurricane-related home damage, and exposure to traumatic events were associated with PTSS that co-occurred with PD. Hurricane-related home damage and traumatic events were associated with PTSS without PD. Home damage was an especially important predictor of chronic PTSS, with and without PD. Most hurricane stressors did not have strong associations with PD alone over the short or long run. Over the long run, higher earnings were protective against PD, and greater social support was protective against PTSS. These results indicate that mental health problems, particularly PTSS alone or in co-occurrence with PD, among Hurricane Katrina survivors remain a concern, especially for those who experienced hurricane-related trauma and had poor mental health or low socioeconomic status before the hurricane.

AB  - Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are a common comorbidity in veterans seeking treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP). However, little is known regarding the mutual influence of PTSD and CMP in this population. Using cross-sectional and longitudinal data from a randomized clinical trial evaluating a stepped care intervention for CMP in Iraq/Afghanistan veterans (ESCAPE), this dissertation examined the relationships between PTSD and CMP along with other factors including depression, anxiety, catastrophizing and health-related quality of life. The Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was conducted to identify key factors associated with baseline PTSD besides CMP severity. A series of statistical analyses including logistical regression analysis, mixed model repeated measure analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and cross-lagged panel analysis via structural equation modeling were conducted to test five competing models of PTSD symptom clusters, and to examine the mutual influences of PTSD symptom clusters and CMP outcomes. Results showed baseline pain intensity and pain disability predicted PTSD at 9 months. And baseline PTSD predicted improvement of pain disability at 9 months. Moreover, direct relationships were found between PTSD and the disability component of CMP, and indirect relationships were found between PTSD, CMP and CMP components (intensity and disability) mediated by depression, anxiety and pain catastrophizing. Finally, the coexistence of PTSD and more severe pain was associated with worse SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores. Together these findings provided empirical support for the mutual maintenance theory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study examined the long-term course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by analyzing rates of recurrence and the predictive value of comorbid psychiatric disorders and psychosocial functioning. METHODS: This study is based on diagnostic assessments administered at intake and subsequent follow-up interviews over a period of 15 years in a sample of 90 anxiety-disordered patients with comorbid PTSD who participated in the Harvard Brown Anxiety Research project (HARP). Kaplan-Meier life table analysis revealed a 0.20 probability of full remission during the 15 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Latent growth model (LGM) analysis revealed that the number of trauma exposures was a predictor of a worse course of PTSD but only during some intervals of the 15-year follow-up. Subjects with full social phobia were more likely to experience worsening of PTSD over time in comparison with subjects with less severe social phobia. Role functioning in the areas of household and employment was a significant predictor of a declining course of PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed the dynamic nature of the predictive value of traumatic experiences, the deleterious effect of social phobia and the long term effect of psychosocial functioning on the course of PTSD. Implications for treatment planning and development of interventions for PTSD are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal trajectories of acute stress reactions over the course of diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up assessments in a group of non-metastatic breast cancer patients during five different moments of the illness process, and to identify psychological predictors of the trajectories. Methods: The sample was formed by 102 non-metastatic breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Latent growth mixture models (LGMM) were used to identify latent classes, and we used multinomial logistic regression in a conditional model to examine predictors to differentiate between trajectories. Results: We identified four different groups according to their trajectories: (1) a resilient group, (44.5 %); (2) a mild acute stress group, (40.6 %); (3) a delayed–recovery group (11.9 %); and (4) a chronic acute stress group (2.9 %). Moreover, anxious preoccupation showed the strongest significant effects in predicting each class, whereas cognitive avoidance and type C personality had moderate effects for participants in the mild acute stress group. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the majority of breast cancer patients in our study were resilient, with only a small percentage showing chronic acute stress. Because coping strategies, specifically anxious preoccupation, and not more stable variables played a main role in the prediction of acute stress trajectories, future preventive interventions should center in promoting more adaptive coping strategies in breast cancer patients. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Background Although a large body of empirical research has examined negative psychological outcomes in older veterans, relatively little is known about the prevalence and determinants of psychological resilience in this population. Methods A nationally representative sample of 2,025 U.S. veterans aged 60 and older (mean = 71.0, standard deviation = 7.1, range = 60-96) completed a web-based survey as part of the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS). Cluster analysis of measures of lifetime potentially traumatic events, and current PTSD, major depression, and generalized anxiety symptoms was used to classify psychological outcomes. Results A three-group solution best fit the data: Control (low number of lifetime traumas, low current psychological distress; 60.4%); Resilient (high number of lifetime traumas, low current psychological distress; 27.5%); and distressed (high number of lifetime traumas, high current psychological distress; 12.1%). Among older veterans with a high number of traumas, 69.5% were in the Resilient group. Compared to the Distressed group, the Resilient group was more likely to have college or higher level of education, and to be married or living with a partner. They also scored higher on measures of emotional stability, social connectedness (i.e., secure attachment style, social support), protective psychosocial characteristics (e.g., community integration, purpose in life), and positive perceptions of the military's effect on one's life; and lower on measures of physical health difficulties and psychiatric problems, and openness to experiences. Conclusions Among older U.S. veterans who have endured a high number of traumas in their lifetimes, nearly 70% are psychologically resilient in later life. Prevention efforts targeted toward bolstering social connectedness, community integration, and purpose in life may help promote psychological resilience in older veterans who endured a significant number of traumas in their lives.

AB  - Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by heterogeneous clusters of re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing, and hyperarousal symptoms. A large body of confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) studies has demonstrated that four-factor dysphoria and emotional numbing models provide a better representation of PTSD symptom dimensionality compared to the three-factor DSM-IV model. Recently, CFA studies of various trauma-exposed samples have found that a novel five-factor model, which separates the DSM-IV hyperarousal symptom cluster into distinct dysphoric and anxious arousal clusters, provides a superior representation of PTSD symptom dimensionality. To date, however, no study of which we are aware has evaluated the best dimensional representation of PTSD symptoms in World Trade Center (WTC) responders, or how symptom clusters from this model are prospectively related. Methods: Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were used to examine the factor structure of the PTSD Checklist in a cohort of 10,835 WTC responders, including 4,035 police responders and 6,800 non-traditional responders, who were evaluated an average of 3, 6, and 8 years after the WTC attacks. An autoregressive cross-lagged panel regression analysis was then conducted to evaluate interrelationships among PTSD symptom clusters over time. Results: CFAs revealed that a five-factor model comprised of intercorrelated clusters of re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal symptoms provided the best representation of PTSD symptoms in police and non-traditional WTC responders. In police responders, anxious arousal symptoms were most strongly prospectively linked to reexperiencing symptoms, and dysphoric arousal to numbing symptoms in the intermediate-term, while re-experiencing symptoms predominantly drove numbing symptoms in the long-term. In non-traditional responders, anxious arousal symptoms were most strongly prospectively linked to re-experiencing symptoms, while dysphoric arousal symptoms predominantly drove numbing symptoms over time. In both groups of responders, avoidance symptoms drove re-experiencing symptoms over time. Conclusions: A novel 5-factor model comprised of re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal symptoms best represented PTSD symptomatology in both traditional and non-traditional disaster responders. Prospective interrelationships among these symptom clusters suggest that targeting hyperarousal and avoidance symptoms early after disaster exposure may help reduce later symptoms of re-experiencing and numbing in disaster responders.

AB  - Background Longitudinal symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are often characterized by heterogeneous trajectories, which may have unique pre-, peri-and post-trauma risk and protective factors. To date, however, no study has evaluated the nature and determinants of predominant trajectories of PTSD symptoms in World Trade Center (WTC) responders. Method A total of 10835 WTC responders, including 4035 professional police responders and 6800 non-traditional responders (e.g. construction workers) who participated in the WTC Health Program (WTC-HP), were evaluated an average of 3, 6 and 8 years after the WTC attacks. Results Among police responders, longitudinal PTSD symptoms were best characterized by four classes, with the majority (77.8%) in a resistant/resilient trajectory and the remainder exhibiting chronic (5.3%), recovering (8.4%) or delayed-onset (8.5%) symptom trajectories. Among non-traditional responders, a six-class solution was optimal, with fewer responders in a resistant/resilient trajectory (58.0%) and the remainder exhibiting recovering (12.3%), severe chronic (9.5%), subsyndromal increasing (7.3%), delayed-onset (6.7%) and moderate chronic (6.2%) trajectories. Prior psychiatric history, Hispanic ethnicity, severity of WTC exposure and WTC-related medical conditions were most strongly associated with symptomatic trajectories of PTSD symptoms in both groups of responders, whereas greater education and family and work support while working at the WTC site were protective against several of these trajectories. Conclusions Trajectories of PTSD symptoms in WTC responders are heterogeneous and associated uniquely with pre-, peri-and post-trauma risk and protective factors. Police responders were more likely than non-traditional responders to exhibit a resistant/resilient trajectory. These results underscore the importance of prevention, screening and treatment efforts that target high-risk disaster responders, particularly those with prior psychiatric history, high levels of trauma exposure and work-related medical morbidities. © 2013 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - A growing number of studies have examined the prevalence and correlates of psychopathology in Veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF-OIF), but few have examined determinants of resilience in this population. This study employed a novel approach to classify psychological resilience in a cross-sectional sample of OEF-OIF Veterans. A total of 272 predominantly older reserve/National Guard OEF/OIF Veterans completed a mail survey that assessed combat exposure, psychopathology, psychosocial functioning, and aspects of social support. Cluster analysis of scores on measures of combat exposure and PTSD symptoms revealed that a three-group solution best fit the data: Controls (low combat exposure, low PTSD symptoms); PTSD (high combat exposure, high PTSD symptoms); and Resilient (high combat exposure, low PTSD symptoms). Compared to the PTSD group, the Resilient group was more likely to be in a relationship and active duty; they also scored lower on a measure of psychosocial dysfunction, and higher on measures of psychological resilience and postdeployment social support. Logistic regression analysis revealed that being in a relationship, having fewer psychosocial difficulties, and reporting greater perceptions of purpose/control and family support and understanding were significantly associated with resilient group membership. Results of this study demonstrate a novel approach to classifying psychological resilience and suggest that interventions to mitigate psychosocial difficulties, enhance perceptions of purpose and control, and bolster family support and understanding may help promote resilience to combat-related PTSD in OEF-OIF Veterans.

AB  - Background: While many researches focus on psychiatric disorders during the prepartum period, to our knowledge, there is no study on psychological profiles. The aim of this longitudinal study was to examine typologies of women during the prepartum period and to determine whether these typologies differ on psychiatric disorder symptoms (short- and long-term). Methods: Between the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy (T1), a sample of 46 women completed questionnaires measuring fear of childbirth and pretraumatic stress disorder symptoms. At 3 days postpartum (T2), they completed questionnaires assessing their experience of childbirth, labor pain and peritraumatic distress. Posttraumatic stress and postpartum depressive symptoms were assessed at 6. weeks postpartum (T3). Anxiety and depressive symptoms were also assessed at T1, T2 and T3. Results: Four typologies were highlighted: the "Resilient Group" characterized by a low level of symptoms; the "Fear Group" with significant symptoms of fear of childbirth; the "Anxiety Group" characterized by anxiety symptoms and a "Prettraumatic Fear Anxiety Depression Group" characterized by a high level of symptoms. Our results also suggest the impact of symptoms during the prepartum period on postpartum symptoms. Conclusion: Further studies on prepartum psychiatric disorders are warranted in order to prevent subsequent disorders from developing. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Objective Research shows great individual variation in changes in posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) after major traumas of terrorist attacks, military combat, and natural disasters. Earlier studies have identified specific mental health trajectories both in children and adults. This study aimed, first, to identify potential PTSS-related trajectories by using latent class growth analyses among children in a three-wave assessment after the 2008/2009 War on Gaza, Palestine. Second, it analyzed how family- and child related factors (e.g., attachment relations, posttraumatic cognitions (PTCs), guilt, and emotion regulation) associate with the trajectory class membership. 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Methods The sample consisted of 240 Palestinian children (49.4% girls and 50.6% boys) of 10-13 years of age (M=11.29, SD=0.68), who completed PTSS (CRIES) assessments at 3 (T1), 5 (T2), and 11 (T3) months after the war. Children reported their personal exposure to war trauma, attachment style, cognitive trauma processing, and emotion regulation, and their parents reported family war trauma exposure and attachment style.
Results Results revealed a three-trajectory solution, a majority of children belonging to the Recovery trajectory (n=183), and a minority belonged either to Resistant trajectory (n=29) or to Increasing symptoms trajectory (n=28). Low levels of negative posttraumatic cognitive appraisals, feelings of guilt and emotion regulation were characteristic of children in the Resistant trajectory as compared to Increasing symptoms trajectory. Father's attachment security was further associated with the Resistant trajectory membership. Children's attachment avoidance and high parental trauma were typical to children in Recovery trajectory (as compared to the Increasing symptoms trajectory).

AB  - Objective: Despite the popularity of the concept of resilience, little research has been conducted on populations in physical rehabilitation settings. Our purpose was to identify three trajectories of psychological adjustment to an acquired severe physical injury characterized by resilience, recovery, or distress in a longitudinal design. Participants: Eighty inpatients with a severe injury at a rehabilitation hospital. The participants had spinal cord injury or multiple traumas. Design: Classification into the three trajectories was based on symptoms of psychological distress (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and negative affect) and participants' level of positive affect at admission to and discharge from the rehabilitation hospital. Results: The most common trajectory was the resilience trajectory (54%), followed by the recovery trajectory (25%) and the distress trajectory (21%). The most interesting differences between the trajectories were the result of optimism, affect, social support, and pain. Trait negative and positive affect predicted classification into the trajectories. Conclusions: An adaptation pattern characterized by resilience was found to be the most common response to an acquired severe injury, and trait affect predicts the outcome pattern. Interventions based on resilience are discussed. (copyright) 2010 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Background: Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often exhibit high-risk substance use behaviors. Complementary and alternative therapies are increasingly used for mental health disorders, although evidence is sparse. Objectives: Investigate the effect of a yoga intervention on alcohol and drug abuse behaviors in women with PTSD. Secondary outcomes include changes in PTSD symptom perception and management and initiation of evidence-based therapies. Materials and Methods: The current investigation analyzed data from a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing a 12-session yoga intervention with an assessment control for women age 18 to 65 years with PTSD. The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) and Drug Use Disorder Identification Test (DUDIT) were administered at baseline, after the intervention, and a 1-month follow-up. Linear mixed models were used to test the significance of the change in AUDIT and DUDIT scores over time. Treatment-seeking questions were compared by using Fisher exact tests. Results: The mean AUDIT and DUDIT scores decreased in the yoga group; in the control group, mean AUDIT score increased while mean DUDIT score remained stable. In the linear mixed models, the change in AUDIT and DUDIT scores over time did not differ significantly by group. Most yoga group participants reported a reduction in symptoms and improved symptom management. All participants expressed interest in psychotherapy for PTSD, although only two participants, both in the yoga group, initiated therapy. Conclusions: Results from this pilot study suggest that a specialized yoga therapy may play a role in attenuating the symptoms of PTSD, reducing risk of alcohol and drug use, and promoting interest in evidence-based psychotherapy. Further research is needed to confirm and evaluate the strength of these effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - Objective The aims of the study were to define the heterogeneity of vulvodynia by determining data-driven subgroups within the vulvodynia diagnosis using exploratory cluster analysis and to characterize the subgroups identified. Materials and Methods Included were participants in the longitudinal population-based study of vulvodynia in southeast Michigan who screened positive for vulvodynia at least once during the study. A cluster analysis using variables reflecting vulvar pain characteristics and comorbid pain conditions was conducted. Variables reflecting best separation of clusters were used to assign participants to subgroup categories. Demographic, psychiatric, general health, and other vulvar pain characteristics were summarized for each subgroup, followed by multinomial regression and pairwise comparisons of subgroups on these factors. Results Of 441 women screening positive for vulvodynia during the course of the study, 393 were eligible on the basis of data requirements. Cluster analysis suggested that best subgroup separation was based on the following 2 variables: (1) presence or absence of spontaneous vulvar pain and (2) presence or absence of other comorbid pain conditions. Subgroups did not differ by age or ethnicity. The subgroup having spontaneous pain and other comorbid conditions demonstrated greatest morbidity in general health measures, psychiatric disorders, and other vulvar pain measures. Primary versus secondary vulvodynia did not vary between subgroups and did not assist in subgroup separation in the cluster analysis. Discussion Subgroups based on exploratory cluster analysis demonstrated that presence of spontaneous pain and the presence of comorbid pain conditions resulted in best separation of groups. Presence of both spontaneous pain and other comorbid pain conditions identified the group with greatest morbidity.

AB  - Introduction: Most research on the psychological impact of sexual assault has been cross-sectional. Using a longitudinal design, we examined the course of PTSD in a group of recent rape survivors. We found 4 distinct PTSD symptom trajectories that we labeled resilience, recovery, moderate chronicity, and high chronicity (Steenkamp et al, 2010). Studies have shown that negative social reactions to assault disclosure correlate with greater PTSD symptom severity (Borja, 2006; Ullman & Filipas, 2001) and can deter victims from seeking help (Ahrens, 2006). However, the extent to which social reactions to rape predict different symptom courses is unknown. Method: Sixty-nine sexual assault survivors completed online questionnaires monthly for the first 4 months following the assault. The Social Reactions Questionnaire (SRQ) assesses 7 types of positive and negative reactions to sexual assault disclosure (emotional support, treat differently, distraction, take control, informational support, victim blame, and egocentric; Ullman, 2000). PTSD symptom severity was assessed using the PTSD Checklist (PCL-C, Weathers et al, 1993). Results: An analysis of variance indicated that the moderate chronic group reported significantly more negative reactions than both the recovery (P = .008) and resilience (P = .04) groups. Specifically, negative reactions where the person treated the survivor differently or took control of the situation distinguished between the moderate chronic and the recovery/resilience groups. Blaming the victim or making the situation about the person instead of the survivor distinguished between the moderate chronic and the resilience groups. Discussion: Consistent with previous studies, negative social reactions to assault disclosure were associated with greater PTSD symptom severity. However, this is the first study demonstrating that social reactions after sexual assault predict distinct PTSD trajectories, with negative reactions predicting a chronic PTSD symptom course. This suggests that reactions of mental health providers, friends, and family may affect PTSD symptom trajectories in survivors and has implications for improving social reactions to sexual assault disclosure. Public Health Significance: In addition to interventions directly targeting survivors' distress and PTSD symptoms after sexual assault, it may be helpful to educate others on the impact of negative social reactions after sexual assault disclosure.

AB  - Types of social support and the meaning attributed to each type vary across individuals, contexts and time. Widely studied across disciplines is the role of social support during periods of distress. Factors at multiple levels of social support (individual, network, and community) are often important predictors of psychopathology, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in the aftermath of such events. The trajectory of PTSD after traumatic event exposure, in turn, varies markedly between individuals, differing with regards to onset, symptom patterns, recurrence, comorbidity, response to intervention, and recovery. Recent literature has considered how each of these levels may influence the development and persistence of PTSD. This dissertation is an attempt to bring together substantively overlapping, but disciplinarily siloed discussions related to how individual, network, and community levels of social support contribute to mental health functioning in the aftermath of a population-level disaster. The data demonstrate a clear association between individual (and not network) level social support covariates and PTSD onset as well as resilience/recovery and chronic PTSD. Delayed onset PTSD, on the other hand, was equally associated with network-level variables. Community level variables were excluded from the analyses as they did not show a robust pattern of association with PTSD trajectories in preliminary analyses. Given these findings, it is arguable that the history of defining social support simply as one's actual network or how one perceives of his/her network fails to capture the relational nature of social support as an exchange of resources between two or more unique individuals that can prove beneficial or harmful to the functioning of the recipient. Moreover, this paper argues that individual level social support, which includes individual characteristics and behaviors, is central to the successful exchange of resources (interpersonal and professional) and subsequently to health.

AB  - Objective: Distinguishing transient from persistent anxiety and depression symptoms in older people presenting to general practice with musculoskeletal pain is potentially important for effective management. This study sought to identify distinct post-consultation depression and anxiety symptom trajectories in adults aged over 50 years consulting general practice for non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain. Methods: Self-completion questionnaires, containing measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms, age, gender, pain status, coping and social status were mailed within 1 week of the consultation and at 3, 6 and 12 months. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify anxiety and depression symptoms trajectories, which were ascertained with cut-off score >8 on Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale subscales. Associations between baseline characteristics and cluster membership were examined using multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis (the 3-step approach). Results: Latent class growth analyses determined a 3-cluster anxiety model (n =499) and a 3-cluster depression model (n =501). Clusters identified were: no anxiety problem (44.1%), persistent anxiety problem (33.9%) and transient anxiety symptoms (22.2%); no depression problem (74.1%), persistent depression problem (22.0%) and gradual depression symptom recovery (4.0%). Widespread pain, interference with valued activities, coping by increased behavioral activities, catastrophizing, perceived lack of instrumental support, age >70 years, being female, and performing manual/routine work were associated with anxiety and/or depression clusters. Conclusions: Older people with non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain are at high risk of persistent anxiety and/or depression problems. Biopsychosocial factors, such as pain status, coping strategies, instrumental support, performing manual/routine work, being female and age >70 years, may help identify patients with persistent anxiety and/or depression.

AB  - To identify trajectories of depression and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptom groups after deployment and determine the effect of alcohol use disorder on these trajectories, depression symptoms were modeled using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire in 727 Ohio National Guard members, and PTS symptoms were modeled using the PTSD Checklist in 472 Ohio National Guard members. There were 55.8% who were resistant to depression symptoms across the 4 years of study, and 41.5% who were resistant to PTS symptoms. There were 18.7% and 42.2% of participants who showed resilience (experiencing slightly elevated symptoms followed by a decline, according to Bonanno et al., 2002) to depression and PTS symptoms, respectively. Mild and chronic dysfunction constituted the smallest trajectory groups across disorders. Marital status, deployment to an area of conflict, and number of lifetime stressors were associated with membership into different latent groups for depression (unstandardized beta estimates range = 0.69 to 1.37). Deployment to an area of conflict, number of lifetime traumatic events and education predicted membership into different latent groups for PTS (significant unstandardized beta estimate range = 0.83 to 3.17). AUD was associated with an increase in both symptom outcomes (significant unstandardized beta estimate range = 0.20 to 9.45). These results suggested that alcohol use disorder may have contributed substantially to trajectories of psychopathology in this population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine headache trajectories among persons with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) in the year after injury and the relation of headache trajectory to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at 1 year postinjury. DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal study. SETTING: Participants were recruited through a university medical center and participated in follow-up assessments by telephone. PARTICIPANTS: Prospectively enrolled individuals (N=212) within 1 week of MTBI who were hospitalized for observation or other system injuries. Participants were assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants rated average headache pain intensity using the 0 to 10 numerical rating scale at each assessment period. The PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version was completed at 12 months postinjury. RESULTS: Latent class growth analysis produced a 4-trajectory group model, with groups labeled resolved, worsening, improving, and chronic. Multivariate regression modeling revealed that younger age and premorbid headache correlated with membership in the worse trajectory groups (worsening and chronic; P<.001). Univariate regression revealed a significant association between PTSD and membership in the worse trajectory groups (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Headache is common in the year after MTBI, with younger people, persons who previously had headaches, and persons with PTSD more likely to report chronic or worsening headache. Further research is needed to examine whether PTSD symptoms exacerbate headaches or whether problematic headache symptoms exacerbate PTSD.

AB  - Background: The term neonaticide describes the act of killing a newborn child by a parent (mostly by the mother) within 24 h after birth. The aim of this study was to establish a classification of female perpetrators using psychopathological, mental, social and biographical characteristics and to make a comparison of the frequency between the old and new federal states in Germany. Material and methods: In this study a total of 63 female German perpetrators who killed at least one newborn between 1986 and 2009 are portrayed and classified by epidemiological and psychopathological characteristics and personality profiles. After obtaining consent from the public prosecutors responsible, data were collected from forensic psychiatric expert opinions and legally valid court verdicts. A questionnaire was established to answer the questions on the psychopathological, e.g. do the women suffer from a mental disease when killing their newborn(s), mental, e.g. can personality accentuations be elicited, social, e.g. are the women unemployed and biographical characteristics of the women, e.g. how old are the women? Finally, an investigation was carried out using significance tests to find out if there was a significant statistical difference in the frequency of neonaticide between the eastern and western federal states. Results: A cluster analysis based on the descriptive analysis was developed. The cluster analysis provided a foundation for a dichotomous classification of the perpetrators depending on five criteria. The first category contained 32 perpetrators who were on average 21 years old, who were primiparous and who hid, ignored or did not perceive their pregnancy. Most of them still lived with their parents. The perpetrators either did not have a mental disease or suffered from an acute stress disorder. The second category contained 31 perpetrators who were on average 25 years old, who were pluriparous, who hid their pregnancy and who lived with their partner. These women either did not have a mental disease or suffer from a personality disorder. A statistically significant higher incidence was found in the eastern federal states of Germany. Conclusion: The presented categorization of female perpetrators into two groups, where the features only show a small degree of overlap, should be taken into consideration in the assessment of the reasons for neonaticide. The typology of female perpetrators is more heterogeneous than previously assumed. The presented typologies and knowledge of conditional constellations involved in neonaticide achieve better prerequisites to be able to recognize persons at risk earlier and to instigate preventive measures. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Despite demonstrated effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there is limited research on the trajectory of PTSD symptom change during the course of these therapies. In addition, existent findings are mixed, making it difficult to know how individuals' PTSD symptoms will change from week to week during psychotherapy. The study presented here uses general growth mixture modeling (GGMM) to test the hypothesis that multiple latent classes will explain individual differences in PTSD symptom change during the course of cognitive processing therapy (CPT). Participants were 207 U.S. military veterans with PTSD who received CPT through an outpatient Veterans Affairs PTSD treatment program. Participants were mostly male (89%), White (81%), and averaged 42 years old. The PTSD Checklist (PCL), Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) were administered at pre- and posttreatment; the PCL was also administered weekly to assess PTSD symptom changes during CPT. GGMM showed that a quadratic growth model with three distinct latent classes best explained the trajectory of PTSD symptom reductions during CPT. The following variables significantly predicted latent class membership: age; ethnicity; having combat as the worst trauma; and pretreatment PCL, CAPS, and BDI-II scores. In turn, class membership significantly predicted posttreatment PCL, BDI-II, and CAPS scores. This study is novel in showing that latent class differences in PTSD symptom reductions are useful in explaining why individuals exhibit variable rates of PTSD symptom change during psychotherapy and differing outcomes after psychotherapy. These findings may improve the ability to more accurately anticipate individual differences in PTSD symptom changes and responses to psychotherapy. © 2012 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Objectives: This study examined trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in impoverished mothers impacted by Hurricane Katrina, as well as how predictive the maternal trajectories were for youth posttraumatic stress symptoms 2 years post-Katrina. Results: Latent Class Growth Analysis demonstrated three primary trajectories emerged among females impacted by Katrina, namely, (1) chronic (4 %), (2) recovering (30 %), and (3) resilient (66 %), respectively. These trajectories were significantly impacted by prior trauma history, but not hurricane exposure. Additionally, data indicated that children whose parents fell into the chronic PTS trajectory also reported high levels of PTS symptoms. Methods: 360 mother participants displaced by Hurricane Katrina completed self-report measures across four time points related to Hurricane exposure, trauma history, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Additionally, the youth offspring completed a self-report measure of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Conclusions: This study identified three main trajectories typical of female PTS symptoms following disaster and was the first known study to document associations between PTS outcomes among adults and their offspring impacted by a large natural disaster. Future research is warranted and should explore additional risk and protective factors that impact both the parental and child outcomes.

AB  - Objective: This study examined trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in Hurricane Katrina affected youth. Method: A total of 426 youth (51% female; 8-16 years old; mean age=11 years; 75% minorities) completed assessments at 4 time points post-disaster. Measures included Hurricane impact variables (initial loss/disruption and perceived life threat); history of family and community violence exposure, parent and peer social support, and post-disaster posttraumatic stress symptoms. Results: Latent class growth analysis demonstrated that there were three distinct trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms identified for this sample of youth (resilient, recovering, and chronic, respectively). Youth trajectories were associated with Hurricane-related initial loss/disruption, community violence, and peer social support. Conclusions: The results suggest that youth exposed to Hurricane Katrina have variable posttraumatic stress disorder symptom trajectories. Significant risk and protective factors were identified. Specifically, youth Hurricane and community violence exposure increased risk for a more problematic posttraumatic stress disorder symptom trajectory, while peer social support served as a protective factor for these youth. Identification of these factors suggests directions for future research as well as potential target areas for screening and intervention with disaster exposed youth. Limitations: The convenience sample limits the external validity of the findings to other disaster exposed youth, and the self-report data is susceptible to response bias.

AB  - Objective Identified patterns of connectedness in youth with cancer and demographically similar healthy peers. Method Participants included 153 youth with a history of cancer and 101 youth without a history of serious illness (8-19 years). Children completed measures of connectedness, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and benefit-finding. Parents also reported on children's PTSS. Results Latent profile analysis revealed four profiles: high connectedness (45%), low connectedness (6%), connectedness primarily to parents (40%), and connectedness primarily to peers (9%). These profiles did not differ by history of cancer. However, profiles differed on PTSS and benefit-finding. Children highly connected across domains displayed the lowest PTSS and highest benefit-finding, while those with the lowest connectedness had the highest PTSS, with moderate PTSS and benefit-finding for the parent and peer profiles. Conclusion Children with cancer demonstrate patterns of connectedness similar to their healthy peers. Findings support connectedness as a possible mechanism facilitating resilience and growth. © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Pediatric Psychology.

AB  - Primary objective: To evaluate longitudinal trajectories of emotional distress symptoms after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Research design: Longitudinal study. Methods and procedures: Patients with mild-to-severe TBI, 118 patients participated at 3 months, 109 attended at 1-year and 89 attended the 5-year follow-up. Emotional distress was measured with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Patients were also assessed for coping style, anxiety, depression, substance abuse and trauma severity. Main outcomes and results: Based on growth mixture modelling, four trajectories of emotional distress symptoms were identified: 73.5% of patients were characterized by a pattern of resilience, 6.8% by a pattern of delayed distress, 14.6% by recovery and 5.1% by chronic distress. Relative to the resilience trajectory, avoidant-coping style and psychiatric problems were related to recovery and chronic trajectories. The delayed trajectory was similar to the resilience trajectory, except for elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms at 1- and 5-years. Demographics and injury-related variables were not significantly associated with emotional distress trajectories. Conclusions: Resilience was the most common trajectory following TBI. Patients characterized by recovery and chronic trajectories required attention and long-term clinical monitoring of their symptoms. Future research would benefit from longitudinal studies to analyse emotional distress symptoms and the strength of resilience over time.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are a common reaction in parents to their child's cancer diagnosis. However, little is known about how parents' PTSS develop during the course of the disease and about how fathers' and mothers' symptom trajectories are related. The present study had two aims: (1) examine the change in parents' PTSS and (2) examine the dynamic longitudinal relationship between fathers' and mothers' PTSS, exploring the phenomenon of interdependent emotional systems in this population. METHOD: Participants of this study were 91 parental dyads whose children were diagnosed with cancer. Mothers and fathers completed the PTSD Checklist - Civilian Version (PCL-C; Weathers et al., 1993) via telephone after the moment of diagnosis, during treatment and after the end of successful treatment or transplantation. The latent difference score (LDS) modelling framework was applied to the data collected at six assessments. The framework of LDS modelling represents an alternative method for the structural modelling of longitudinal data combining features of latent growth curve models and cross-lagged regression models. The models were fit using Mplus (Muthen & Muthen, 1998- 2010). RESULTS: Results generally indicated that fathers' and mothers' PTSS decreased proportionally to their previous symptom levels. Further, LDS analyses revealed that change in fathers' PTSS was proportional to previous symptom levels in corresponding mothers after the end of successful treatment or transplantation, respectively. That is, mothers with high levels of PTSS put fathers at risk for stagnating or even increased symptoms over time. Reversely, when fathers suffered from high levels of PTSS, mothers with low symptom levels had a protective effect. For mothers, however, change in symptoms was not significantly associated with fathers' previous levels of PTSS. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, crucial processes in parental dyads may be overlooked when mothers and fathers are examined as 2 separate units. Previous studies are limited with regard to investigating how parents' PTSS are dyamically related over time. The findings of this study demonstrate that one parent may act as a risk or, conversely, as a protective factor in terms of the other parent's development of PTSS. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: The present analyses of coupled change in PTSS were mainly exploratory, aiming at identifying the phenomenon of interdependent emotional systems. Since the results indicate that parents actually react as an emotional system rather than as 2 separate units, theoretical models of mechanisms by which parental dyads influence each other in symptom development are desirable. On that basis, refined research questions can be addressed in future studies. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Future psychosocial strategies may be based on the unique needs of the parental dyad. A more efficient and rapid route to symptom reduction in one parent may involve considering the role of the other parent. It may be important to buffer the endangering effect of a highly affected other parent, or foster the protective potential of a less affected other parent, respectively. Psychosocial care addressing both parents may strengthen the relationship between mothers and fathers.

AB  - Background: Tens of thousands of traditional and non-traditional first responders were involved in rescue and recovery operations following the September 11th terrorist attacks. These responders endured unprecedented hazardous working conditions and psychological stressors while working at Ground Zero and/or the Staten Island landfill. Previous cross-sectional studies have examined the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in WTC responders; however, little is known about longitudinal trajectories of PTSD symptoms in this population. In this study, we evaluated longitudinal trajectories of World Trade Center (WTC)-related PTSD symptoms in more than 10,000 police and non-traditional WTC responders; we then identified pre-, peri-, and post-9/11 determinants of these trajectories. Methods: Latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) was utilized to characterize the nature of WTC-related PTSD symptom trajectories amongst 10,835 WTC responders, including 4,035 police responders and 6,800 nontraditional responders, who attended monitoring visits at the CDCestablished WTC Health Program (WTC-HP) an average of 3, 6, and 8 years post-9/11. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were then conducted to assess determinants of the WTC-related PTSD symptom trajectories. Results: LGMM analyses revealed that a 4-class solution optimally characterized longitudinal PTSD symptoms in police WTC responders: resistant (77.8%), delayed-onset (8.5%), recovering (8.4%), and severe chronic (5.3%). In non-traditional WTC responders, a 6-class solution was optimal: resistant (58.0%), recovering (12.3%), severe chronic (9.5%), subsyndromal increasing (7.3%), delayed-onset (6.7%), and moderate chronic (6.2%). A greater proportion of police responders manifested a resilient trajectory (77.8%) compared to non-traditional responders (58.0%). In both police and non-traditional responder groups, increased severity of WTC exposure, prior psychiatric history, greater number of WTC-related medical conditions, and Hispanic ethnicity were strongly associated with symptomatic PTSD trajectories. Family and work social support while working at the WTC site was a protective factor for both groups, while early arrival was protective among nontraditional responders. Conclusion: This study is the first of which we are aware to examine longitudinal trajectories of WTC-related PTSD trajectories in WTC responders. A greater proportion of police responders manifested a resilient trajectory compared to non-traditional responders, which is likely attributable to their greater training and disaster preparedness. These results suggest that greater training in disaster preparedness, as well as peri-disaster familial and work support may help protect against deleterious psychological outcomes in disaster responders, particularly those with risk factors such as prior psychiatric history, Hispanic ethnicity, greater severity of traumatic exposure, and any disaster-related medical co-morbidities.

AB  - Purpose: Military personnel exposed to combat are at risk for experiencing post-traumatic distress that can progress over time following deployment. We hypothesized that progression of post-traumatic distress may be related to enhanced susceptibility to post-deployment stressors. This study aimed at examining the concept of stress sensitization prospectively in a sample of Dutch military personnel deployed in support of the conflicts in Afghanistan. Method: In a cohort of soldiers (N = 814), symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed before deployment as well as 2, 7, 14, and 26 months (N = 433; 53 %) after their return. Data were analyzed using latent growth modeling. Using multiple group analysis, we examined whether high combat stress exposure during deployment moderated the relation between post-deployment stressors and linear change in post-traumatic distress after deployment. Results: A higher baseline level of post-traumatic distress was associated with more early life stressors (standardized regression coefficient = 0.30, p < 0.001). In addition, a stronger increase in posttraumatic distress during deployment was associated with more deployment stressors (standardized coefficient = 0.21, p < 0.001). A steeper linear increase in posttraumatic distress post-deployment (from 2 to 26 months) was predicted by more post-deployment stressors (standardized coefficient = 0.29, p < 0.001) in high combat stress exposed soldiers, but not in a less combat stress exposed group. The group difference in the predictive effect of post-deployment stressors on progression of post-traumatic distress was significant (χ2(1) = 7.85, p = 0.005). Conclusions: Progression of post-traumatic distress following combat exposure may be related to sensitization to the effects of post-deployment stressors during the first year following return from deployment. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Objectives: Outcomes after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) vary, with slow or incomplete recovery for a significant minority. This study examines whether groups of cases with shared psychological factors but with different injury outcomes could be identified using cluster analysis. Method: This is a prospective observational study following 147 adults presenting to a hospital-based emergency department or concussion services in Christchurch, New Zealand. This study examined associations between baseline demographic, clinical, psychological variables (distress, injury beliefs and symptom burden) and outcome 6 months later. A two-step approach to cluster analysis was applied (Ward's method to identify clusters, K-means to refine results). Results: Three meaningful clusters emerged (high-adapters, medium-adapters, low-adapters). Baseline cluster-group membership was significantly associated with outcomes over time. High-adapters appeared recovered by 6-weeks and medium-adapters revealed improvements by 6-months. The low-adapters continued to endorse many symptoms, negative recovery expectations and distress, being significantly at risk for poor outcome more than 6-months after injury (OR (good outcome)=0.12; CI=0.03-0.53; p<0.01). Conclusions: Cluster analysis supported the notion that groups could be identified early post-injury based on psychological factors, with group membership associated with differing outcomes over time. Implications for clinical care providers regarding therapy targets and cases that may benefit from different intensities of intervention are discussed.

AB  - Objective: This study assessed the psychopathological effects of combat in veterans with and without combat stress reaction. Method: Veterans (N=214) from the 1982 Lebanon War were assessed in a prospective longitudinal design: 131 suffered from combat stress reaction during the war, and 83 did not. They were evaluated 1, 2, 3, and 20 years after the war. Results: Combat stress reaction is an important vulnerability marker. Veterans with combat stress reaction were 6.6 times more likely to endorse posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at all four measurements, their PTSD was more severe, and they were at increased risk for exacerbation/reactivation. A qualitative analysis of the profile of PTSD symptoms revealed some time-related changes in the symptom configuration of veterans who did not suffer from combat stress reaction. In both groups, the course fluctuated; PTSD rates dropped 3 years postwar and rose again 17 years later; 23% of veterans without combat stress reaction reported delayed PTSD. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the detrimental effects of combat are deep and enduring and follow a complex course, especially in combat stress reaction casualties. The implications of aging and ongoing terror in impeding recovery from the psychological wounds of war are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptom-level variation in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has not yet been examined in the early post-deployment phase, but may be meaningful etiologically, prognostically, and clinically. METHODS: Using latent class analysis (LCA), we examined PTSD symptom heterogeneity in a cohort of participants from the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS), a longitudinal study of combat Marines deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan (N=892). Typologies of PTSD symptom presentation were examined at one month pre-deployment and again one, five, and eight months post-deployment. RESULTS: Heterogeneity in PTSD symptom presentation was evident at each assessment point, and the degree of symptom heterogeneity (i.e., the number of classes identified) differed by time point. Symptom patterns stabilized over time from notable symptom fluctuations during the early post-deployment period to high, medium, and low symptom severity by eight months post-deployment. Hypervigilance and exaggerated startle were frequently endorsed by participants in the initial month post-deployment. Flashbacks, amnesia, and foreshortened future were infrequently endorsed. Greater combat exposure, lifespan trauma, and avoidant coping generally predicted worse outcomes. LIMITATIONS: Data were self-report and may have limited generalizability due to our lack of women and inclusion of only combat Marines. Attrition and re-ranging of data resulted in significant missing data and affected the representativeness of the sample. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom-level variability is highest in the month following deployment and then stabilizes over time. Should post-deployment assessments occur too soon, they may capture common and transient early post-deployment reactions, particularly anxious arousal.

AB  - Background: Investigation of psychological and behavioral changes in the aftermath of trauma has focused primarily on mechanisms for maintenance and recovery from posttraumatic stress. However, the scope and nature of “core” symptoms is a topic of longstanding debate, resulting in a recent change in diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the DSM-5. Complicating factors include the fact that responses to trauma vary greatly from individual to individual, and often include depressive symptoms. We propose an alternative approach to study responses to trauma that, in contrast with selecting a set of criteria for a particular disorder (e.g., PTSD, depression), accounts for both anxiety and depressive symptoms in a dimensional manner. This approach is consistent with the NIMH Research Domain Criteria approach to the study of mental illness. We examined symptom severity within datadriven symptom clusters derived using principle components analysis (PCA). We then examined individual differences in declarative memory (behavior and neural activation) as a test-case for further study linking continuous symptom clusters with intermediate phenotypes. Methods: N=6248 participants who reported at least one traumatic experience were recruited from the primary care waiting rooms of a public inner-city hospital in Atlanta, GA. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify clusters of post-traumatic anxiety and depression symptoms, as measured by the modified PTSD symptom scale (MPSS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The PCA included 17 items on the MPSS and 21 items on the BDI, and resulted in six components. The components were interpreted as reflecting Negative Affect, Somatic Symptoms, Re-experiencing, Numbing, Hypervigilance, and Impaired Cognition. Relations between these components and psychological outcome measures were examined. A subset of N=47 traumatized women completed an fMRI scan measuring declarative memory encoding of complex scene stimuli and completed a delayed cued recall task, and the effects of the 6 PCs on memory encoding were examined. Results: Individuals who were high on one PC had low scores on the other PCs, suggesting sub-types of trauma responses. Of the 6 components, the Negative Affect component most strongly predicted emotion dysregulation (EDS t=41.6, DERS t=12.9), current drug abuse (DAST t=8.6), and was inversely associated with resilience (CDRISC t=-30.9). The Re-experiencing component most strongly predicted a convergent measure of PTSD severity (CAPS t=12.6) and PTSD-related problem behaviors (PABQ t=7.34). Whereas Negative Affect was most strongly related to childhood trauma (CTQ t=28.7), Re-experiencing was most strongly related to adult trauma (TEI t=21.6). None of the PCs correlated with cued recall performance, ps4.10. In the fMRI analyses, Negative Affect predicted decreased right amygdala activation to images that were subsequently recalled versus not-recalled, whereas Re-experiencing predicted increased bilateral amygdala and hippocampal activation to recalled versus not-recalled items, p<.05, corrected. Conclusions: The current study identified a novel approach to quantifying post-trauma symptoms, which characterized anxiety and depression symptoms without the need to include one or the other as a “control” variable. This datadriven approach identified symptom clusters that included some similarities with DSM-5 symptom clusters but also diverged in important ways. In particular, avoidance symptoms did not form an independent cluster, but loaded onto several PCs. This may reflect the fact that avoidance is a behavioral coping strategy used by individuals experiencing a variety of different types of trauma responses, or may alternately be causal to several types of symptoms. Whereas trauma-related amnesia is clustered with Negative Affect in DSM-5, here it clustered with concentration difficulties in the Impaired Cognition component. Most interestingly, Negative Affect and Re-experiencing appeared to track very different manifestations of p st-traumatic reactions that differed in their neurobiological underpinnings. Further, given that childhood trauma severity was associated with the Negative Affect component, and adult trauma severity was associated with the Re-experiencing component, this analysis points to differential etiology resulting in different clinical and neural signatures. Such transdiagnostic and dimensional approaches are advocated by RDoC and may lead to greater precision in treating the negative sequelae of traumatic experiences.

AB  - This study investigated the trajectory of traumatic stress symptoms in the aftermath of the 2004 Southeast Asian earthquake-tsunami. A total of 265 adult Thai survivors were assessed at 2 weeks and 6 months following the earthquake-tsunami. The percentages of survivors reporting traumatic stress symptoms were 22% at 2 weeks and 30% at 6 months postdisaster. Four trajectories of traumatic stress symptoms were identified: 12% of survivors presented with chronic stress symptoms, 18% had a delayed onset, 10% showed improvement, and the remaining 60% maintained a stable emotional equilibrium. Among survivors, the chronic group was the oldest, the delayed group reported the lowest level of perceived government support, and the resilient group experienced the fewest postdisaster psychiatric symptoms. Results pointed to the need to broaden the conceptualization of postdisaster stress responding as well as to establish disaster psychiatry and related mental health activities in the region.

AB  - Questions remain about the nosological status of intermittent explosive disorder (IED) as a universal diagnosis. Cross-cultural studies are needed to establish whether IED symptoms form a coherent pattern and are distinguishable from other related symptom constellations. A study amongst a refugee population also allows further inquiry of the relationship between exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and other adversities with the IED constellation. In the present study amongst West Papuan refugees residing in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, we apply culturally adapted interview modules to assess symptoms of IED, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression, as well as the potentially traumatic events (PTEs) of conflict and ongoing adversity in the post-migration environment. Latent class analysis yielded a PTSD class (23%), a posttraumatic depressive class (14%), an IED class (12%), and a low/no symptom class (49%). Compared to the low/no-symptom class, the PTSD class had high levels of exposure to all PTE domains including childhood-related adversities, witnessing murder, human rights trauma, and traumatic losses, as well as ongoing adversity relating to displacement and separation from families, safety concerns, and lack of access to basic needs and health care. The posttraumatic depression class had greater exposure to traumatic losses and childhood-related adversities, higher levels of stress relating to material loss and deprivation, as well as to displacement and separation from families. In contrast, the IED class was distinguished only by the ongoing stress of displacement and separation from families in the homeland. Our findings provide support for the phenomenological distinctiveness of IED symptoms in this transcultural setting. Although not exclusive to IED, conditions of long-term displacement and separation appear to be a source of ongoing anger and explosive aggression amongst this population.

AB  - Refugees commonly experience traumatic events that threaten the self and close others, suggesting the possibility that they may experience overlapping symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and separation anxiety disorder (SAD). We examine this possibility among West Papua refugees (n = 230) displaced to Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. We also examine associations between the combined PTSD-SAD construct and indices of past trauma exposure, ongoing adversity, and the psychosocial disruptions caused by mass conflict and displacement. We applied culturally adapted interview modules to assess symptoms of PTSD, SAD, traumatic events (TEs), ongoing adversity, and 5 psychosocial dimensions. Latent class analysis identified a PTSD class (23%), a posttraumatic (PT) SAD class (22%), and a low-symptom class (55%). Compared with the low-symptom class, both the PTSD and PT-SAD classes endorsed higher levels of exposure to all domains of TEs (conflict-related trauma, witnessing murder, childhood related adversities, traumatic losses, and health stress) and ongoing adversity (access to health care, displacement/separation, safety in the community, and access to basic needs), but the 2 comorbid groups did not differ on these indices. The PT-SAD class alone scored higher than the low-symptom reference class in relation to disruptions to the psychosocial domains (safety/security, bonds/network, access to justice, roles/identities, existential meaning) and higher than the PTSD class on safety/security, justice and roles/identities. Our findings suggest that the PT-SAD pattern may represent a response to the most severe forms of psychosocial disruptions of mass conflict among refugees. A focus on separation anxiety may enhance psychotherapies designed to treat PTSD in refugees. (PsycINFO Database Record

AB  - We conducted a follow-up assessment to assess the development of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression among Chinese immigrants after the World Trade Center attack. Sixty-five Chinese displaced workers who were originally interviewed in May 2002 were re-interviewed in March 2003. Whereas depression scores decreased over time, average PTSD scores remained unchanged. The trajectory of posttraumatic stress symptoms was more complex, with an increasing number of individuals who show no or little emotional health problems and another increasing group of individuals with exacerbated posttraumatic stress symptoms. Although the mean values of the re-experiencing and hypervigilance cluster did not change over time, the mean value of the avoidance/numbing cluster increased significantly from time 1 (M= 4.60, SD = 4.98) to time 2 (M= 6.34, SD = 4.24), (F1.61=5.69,P= .02). A higher proportion of subjects met diagnostic criteria of PTSD at time 2 (27%) than at time 1 (21%). The study highlights the importance of ongoing mental health surveillance of diverse cultural and linguistic groups after a major traumatic event.

AB  - Millions of volunteers respond after disasters, with a 24% to 46% risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear which symptom trajectories develop and how they differ between core (volunteering before the disaster) and noncore volunteers (joining after the disaster) and which factors predict trajectories. Symptoms of PTSD were assessed at 6-, 12-, and 18-months postearthquake in 449 volunteers in Indonesia. Demographics, previous mental health service use, self-efficacy, social acknowledgment, and type of tasks were assessed at 6 months. In both core and noncore volunteers, 2 PTSD symptom trajectories emerged: a resilient trajectory (moderate levels of symptoms with a slow decrease over time; 90.9%) and a chronic trajectory (higher levels of symptoms with an increase over time; 9.1%). In both trajectories, core volunteers had fewer symptoms than noncore volunteers. Core volunteers in the chronic trajectory were characterized by having sought prior mental help, reported lower levels of self-efficacy and social acknowledgment, and were more likely to have provided psychosocial support to beneficiaries (Cramer's V = .17 to .27, partial eta2 = .02 to .06). Aid organizations should identify and follow up chronic PTSD trajectories in volunteers, including the noncore, who may be out of sight to the organization after the acute response phase.

AB  - OBJECTIVE : Inconsistent links between posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) in youth following a stressful life event have been observed in previous literature. Latent profile analysis (LPA) provides a novel approach to examine the heterogeneity of relations between these constructs. METHOD : Participants were 435 youth (cancer group = 253; healthy comparisons = 182) and one parent. Children completed measures of PTS, PTG, and a life-events checklist. Parents reported on their own PTS and PTG. LPA was conducted to identify distinct adjustment classes. RESULTS : LPA revealed three profiles. The majority of youth (83%) fell into two resilient groups differing by levels of PTG. Several factors predicted youth's profile membership. CONCLUSIONS : PTS and PTG appear to be relatively independent constructs, and their relation is dependent on contextual factors. The majority of youth appear to be resilient, and even those who experience significant distress were able to find benefit.

AB  - Background: Major depression varies widely. This is likely partially explained by non-specific symptomatology and variability in severity and trajectory of depression. Understanding this heterogeneity and delineating subgroups of depression is necessary to identify predictors of response and ultimately to provide precision medicine for depression. Objectives: The study aimed to characterize the subtypes of major depression, evaluate gender differences in subtypes, and examine sociodemographic and clinical correlates of each subtype. Methods: Latent class analysis was applied to baseline data from 2861 participants in Level 1 of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR∗D) trial. Individual DSM-IV criterion symptoms for major depression from the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16) were used as indicators of the latent depression subtype variable. Multinomial logistic models identified the correlates of latent classes (adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)). Results: Four latent classes were identified: mild (women: 38%, men: 27%, p<0.01), moderate (women: 20%, men: 24%, p=0.10), severe with increased appetite (men: 12%, women: 22%, p<0.01), and severe with insomnia (women: 31%, men: 26%, p=0.01). Comorbid generalized anxiety disorder (aORwomen: 1.74; 95%CI: 1.06-2.85), bulimia (aORwomen: 5.44; 95%CI: 3.28-9.03; aORmen: 12.60; 95%CI: 5.40-29.43), and social phobia (aORwomen: 3.70; 95%CI: 2.36-5.80; aORmen: 3.29; 95%CI: 1.74-6.23) were correlated with severe with increased appetite. Generalized anxiety disorder (aORwomen: 2.89; 95%CI: 1.91-4.39; aORmen: 2.05; 95%CI: 1.22-3.42), post-traumatic stress disorder (aORwomen: 2.29; 95%CI: 1.50-3.49; aORmen: 1.94; 95%CI: 1.20-3.13), and social phobia (aORwomen: 2.43; 95%CI: 1.61-6.67) were correlated with severe with insomnia. Conclusions: Insomnia and increased appetite distinguished the subtypes of depression. Anxiety disorders and other psychiatric comorbidities also differed between subtypes. These results suggest that sleep disturbances, metabolic changes, and other mental disorders may play a role in the etiology and treatment of depression.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The efficacy of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatments in psychosis has not been examined in a randomized clinical trial to our knowledge. Psychosis is an exclusion criterion in most PTSD trials. OBJECTIVE To examine the efficacy and safety of prolonged exposure (PE) therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy in patients with psychotic disorders and comorbid PTSD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single-blind randomized clinical trial with 3 arms (N = 155), including PE therapy, EMDR therapy, and waiting list (WL) of 13 outpatient mental health services among patients with a lifetime psychotic disorder and current chronic PTSD. Baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up assessments were made. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive 8 weekly 90-minute sessions of PE (n = 53), EMDR (n = 55), or WL (n = 47). Standard protocols were used, and treatment was not preceded by stabilizing psychotherapeutic interventions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinician-rated severity of PTSD symptoms, PTSD diagnosis, and full remission (on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale) were primary outcomes. Self-reported PTSD symptoms and posttraumatic cognitions were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Data were analyzed as intent to treat with linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations. Participants in the PE and EMDR conditions showed a greater reduction of PTSD symptoms than those in the WL condition. Between-group effect sizes were 0.78 ( P < .001) in PE and 0.65 (P = .001) in EMDR. Participants in the PE condition (56.6%; odds ratio [OR], 3.41; P = .006) or the EMDR condition (60.0%; OR, 3.92; P < .001) were significantly more likely to achieve loss of diagnosis during treatment than those in the WL condition (27.7%). Participants in the PE condition (28.3%; OR, 5.79; P = .01), but not those in the EMDR condition (16.4%; OR, 2.87; P = .10), were more likely to gain full remission than those in the WL condition (6.4%). Treatment effects were maintained at the 6-month follow-up in PE and EMDR. Similar results were obtained regarding secondary outcomes. There were no differences in severe adverse events between conditions (2 in PE, 1 in EMDR, and 4 in WL). The PE therapy and EMDR therapy showed no difference in any of the outcomes and no difference in participant dropout (24.5% in PE and 20.0% in EMDR, P = .57). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Standard PE and EMDR protocols are effective, safe, and feasible in patients with PTSD and severe psychotic disorders, including current symptoms. A priori exclusion of individuals with psychosis from evidence-based PTSD treatments may not be justifiable. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB  - This study investigated traumatic stress symptoms in severely burned survivors of two fire disasters and two comparison groups of patients with "non-disaster" burn injuries, as well as risk factors associated with acute and chronic stress symptoms. Patients were admitted to one out of eight burn centers in the Netherlands or Belgium. The Impact of Event Scale (IES) was administered to 61 and 33 survivors respectively of two fire disasters and 54 and 57 patients with "non-disaster" burn etiologies at 2 weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the event. We used latent growth modeling (LGM) analyses to investigate the stress trajectories and predictors in the two disaster and two comparison groups. The results showed that initial traumatic stress reactions in disaster survivors with severe burns are more intense and prolonged during several months relative to survivors of "non-disaster" burn injuries. Excluding the industrial fire group, all participants' symptoms on average decreased over the two year period. Burn severity, peritraumatic anxiety and dissociation predicted the long-term negative outcomes only in the industrial fire group. In conclusion, fire disaster survivors appear to experience higher levels of traumatic stress symptoms on the short term, but the long-term outcome appears dependent on factors different from the first response. Likely, the younger age, and several beneficial post-disaster factors such as psychosocial aftercare and social support, along with swift judicial procedures, contributed to the positive outcome in one disaster cohort.

AB  - Abstract BackgroundPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that can affect people following the experience of a traumatic event. Few studies have researched on PTSD symptoms of patients with central nervous system tumors. In this study, we aim to examine the association between social support and PTSD symptoms and to explore the mediating effect of self-efficacy in this relationship among patients with central nervous system tumors in China. MethodsQuestionnaires consisting of the Post-traumatic Stress Checklist- Civilian Version, the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, as well as demographic and clinical factors were used to collect information of patients with central nervous system tumors in Liaoning Province, China. A total of 222 patients (effective response rate of 66.1%) became our subjects. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were performed to explore the association between social support and PTSD symptoms and the mediating effect of self-efficacy. ResultsAfter adjusting for demographic characteristics and tumor type, social support was negatively associated with the total score of PTSD symptoms (beta = -0.342, P < 0.01). Social support explained 8.8% of the variance in PTSD symptoms. Self-efficacy was found to partially mediate the relationship between social support and PTSD symptoms. ConclusionsSelf-efficacy partially mediated the relationship between social support and PTSD symptoms. Interventions focusing on both social support and self-efficacy might be more useful than interventions only targeting either of them. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objective: Multiple trajectories of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms are hypothesized following disaster in a number of theoretical perspectives. Increasingly, those with rapidly declining, transient, or stable low symptoms are defined as resilient. This article examines trajectories to understand acute reactions to disaster, and explores the need to define resilience as more than just symptom trajectories. Methods: An urban school-based sample of youth exposed to both hurricanes Katrina and Gustav (n=141; grades 4 through 8) were assessed for PTS symptoms at 12 months and 6 months pre-Gustav (Times 1 and 2); and then again at 1 month post-Gustav (Time 3). Results: Data indicated that there were significant decreases in mean PTS symptoms post-Gustav, but individual trajectories were identified consistent with theory. Whereas an ostensibly resilient group was identified (stable low symptoms), results suggest that the group was heterogeneous in terms of disaster experiences, and that those with low symptoms but relatively high Katrina disaster exposure had a unique coping style. Conclusions: Results provide prospective data to support theories of multiple trauma exposure trajectories, and highlight the importance of empirically identifying resilient youth in terms of both functioning and level of risk exposure in disaster samples. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - This paper has both methodological and substantive application for mental-health researchers. Methodologically, it presents the latent growth curve (LGC) technique within a structural equation modelling (SEM) framework as a powerful tool to analyse change in depressive symptoms and potential correlates of such changes. The rationale for LGC analysis and subsequent elaboration of this statistical approach are presented. The limitations of traditional analytical methods are also addressed. Substantively, the paper considers socio-contextual factors as correlates of change in symptoms, and examines the dynamic systematic relationship with the degree of economic integration of south-east Asian immigrants in Canada over time. Using the LGC technique, this study also investigated how the longitudinal course of subclinical depression places individuals at risk for developing full-blown major depression. The LGC results provided strong evidence for the reciprocal influence between economic integration and subclinical depression of immigrants. The initial level of economic integration negatively influenced the rate of change in subclinical depression whereas the initial level of subclinical depression negatively influenced the rate of change in economic integration. Both initial level and the rate of change in subclinical depression placed individuals at risk for full-blown major depression. However, traditional auto-regressive models were not capable of revealing these dynamic associations. Thus, an investigation of within-individual change in symptoms and potential correlates of such changes is necessary to understand the process that results in full-blown mental disorder.

AB  - Objective: Given its prevalence and impact on health and well-being, children's exposure to traumatic experiences is of growing importance to pediatricians and other medical providers. Little is known, however, about the traumatic experiences profiles, trauma-related sequelae, and service use patterns of youth with chronic or recurrent medical problems/disabilities. This study aimed to fill this research gap. Method: Participants were children less than 18 years of age who were referred for assessment and/or treatment services at one of the 56 National Child Traumatic Stress Network centers from 2004 to 2010 across the United States and had experienced at least one of 13 types of traumatic experience(s) (n = 9885; mean = 11 years, SD = 4.3; 52.3% girls). Generalized linear mixed models were used to examine associations among types of trauma, emotional and behavioral problems, and rates of service utilization adjusting for treatment center-level random effects, demographic characteristics, and the total number of types of trauma exposures. Results: Among children seeking treatment for traumatic stress, those with comorbid medical problems/disabilities had different demographic characteristics, different types of trauma exposure, and more service utilization in multiple sectors before trauma treatment entry than those without comorbid medical problems/disabilities. Those without comorbid medical problems/disabilities had higher levels of some types of traumatic exposures, associated symptoms, and higher levels of behavioral problems at home, school, or day care. Those with medical disorders/disabilities were at 30% to 40% higher odds of meeting clinical criteria for hyperarousal and re-experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, used more medical and mental health services for trauma, and had more emotional and behavioral concerns. Conclusion: Given that pediatricians are more likely to see children with medical disabilities and concerns than those without, there is an opportunity to ask directly about traumatic exposures and associated symptoms and provide support and interventions to promote resilience. Integrating trauma screening and mental health services into medical care could be especially beneficial for children with chronic medical conditions. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for 596 survivors of motor vehicle accidents were examined by self-report measures at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the motor vehicle accident (MVA). Latent growth modeling was utilized to study the trend and predictors of the level of distress. Results indicated that 5-20% of the participants reported to have a significant level of posttraumatic stress in one, two, or three of the PTSD symptom clusters within the period studied. Survivors with significant acute stress 1 week after the MVA had a higher risk for developing chronic posttraumatic stress. Although the severity of intrusive and hyperarousal symptoms decreased over time, the severity of avoidance symptoms remained unchanged. Factors predicting the course of PTSD after an MVA are identified.

AB  - Sophisticated statistical methodologies are needed in order to analyze large, population-based datasets, such as screening projects, following disasters. Currently, the most common methodology applied to disaster research uses marginal or population-averaged models. However, mixture models with latent variables have versatile applications that may provide additional insight into the psychiatric outcomes following disasters and capture population heterogeneity that is usually overlooked. Thus, this dissertation conducts a novel application of these methodologies to a longitudinal database following a disaster. In the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11th, the Weill Cornell Screening Project conducted annual psychological screenings with over 3,000 non-rescue, World Trade Center (WTC) disaster workers from 2002-2008. This dissertation applies two types of categorical mixture models to this dataset: latent class analysis (LCA) and its longitudinal extension, latent transition analysis (LTA). Both models are particularly well suited for the analysis of psychiatric screening data, because they allow individuals to be grouped into classes based on their symptomatology. Furthermore, these methods permit the course of symptoms to be examined over time by modeling individuals' developmental trajectories. The goal of this dissertation was to assess the utility and feasibility of applying LCA and LTA in large scale disaster research, specifically within a study of the longitudinal course of posttraumatic stress symptoms in WTC disaster workers. The LCA model successfully captured the heterogeneity of posttraumatic stress symptoms in this population. Additionally, the LTA model yielded unique information regarding patterns of symptom changes over time. The multiple-group analysis provided information about racial and ethnic differences in PTSD presentation and longitudinal course. The application of LCA and LTA methodologies in this dissertation yielded practical findings in the field of psychiatric and disaster research. These findings have the potential to inform criteria selection for diagnostic manuals and offer insight into the mechanisms involved in the maintenance and remission of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Challenges associated with the analysis of complex longitudinal data from large screening databases and future directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - War captivity is one of the most severe human-inflicted traumatic experiences with wide and substantial long-term negative effects. However, only one retrospective study examined suicidal ideation (SI) among ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs). This study aimed to prospectively assess SI among ex-POWs and its associations with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms over a 17-year period. Two groups of male Israeli veterans from the 1973 Yom Kippur War were examined: ex-POWs and comparable veterans who were not taken captive. Both groups were assessed via self-report measures of SI and PTSD symptoms at three time points: T1 18 (1991), T2 30 (2003), and T3 35 (2008) years after the war. Latent growth curve modeling (LGM) results showed that ex-POWs reported higher levels of SI at T2 and T3 and a pattern of increase in SI levels trajectory over time, compared to control veterans. Furthermore, among ex-POWs, PTSD symptoms at T1 contributed to the increase in rate of change in SI overtime. In addition, PTSD symptoms affected SI at the same measurement, above and beyond above the trajectories of SI. Clinical implications of these findings for the relations between captivity trauma and suicidality are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
