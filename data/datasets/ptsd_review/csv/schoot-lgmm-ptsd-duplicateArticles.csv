"1","a clinical approach to the pharmacotherapy of aggression in children and adolescents","Overt aggression in its various forms is the most prevalent symptom presenting to pediatric mental health providers, regardless of setting. It is a behavior with a heterogeneous etiology and requires a comprehensive approach to evaluation and treatment. Evaluation of the aggressive child must assess medical, neurologic, psychiatric, psychosocial, familial, and/or educational contributions to behavioral dyscontrol. Multimodal treatment is generally required. At present, there is no single medication to recommend for the treatment of aggressive behavior. Multiple medications have clinically been used in a nonspecific fashion to target excessive childhood aggression. Although successful for some, this approach increases risk for ineffective interventions accompanied by side effects. Until a scientific understanding of the developmental neurobiology of aggression leads to more specific treatment, this review suggests the use of a diagnostic-based approach to the pharmacology of aggression. Descriptive diagnostic techniques should be used to define the presence of any primary or comorbid psychiatric disorder that presents with aggression as an associated symptom. Treating aggression in the context of these psychiatric syndromes appears to be the most direct approach. Aggression occurring in the context of a medication-responsive psychiatric diagnosis appears most sensitive to pharmacologic intervention. Presently, evidence for efficacy is strongest for aggression in the context of ADHD, psychotic disorder, adolescent-onset bipolar disorder, and ictal aggression. It remains less clear that medication can help aggression when it occurs independently of a pharmacologically treatable comorbid psychiatric disorder. Aggression may respond to a target symptom approach where discrete behavioral symptoms that contribute to aggression, such as irritability, explosiveness, fear, or impulsivity, may be modified by medication intervention. When treatment is approached in this fashion, it is standard practice to use the least toxic and safest intervention first. Behavioral treatment based on contingency management principles could be initially recommended. Medication trials should first use medications that have demonstrated empiric efficacy in reducing aggression and that have a favorable safety profile. Neuroleptics to treat aggression in nonpsychotic psychiatrically referred youth should be kept to a minimum, secondary to their significant adverse risk profile. Alternative medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake-inhibiting antidepressants, buspirone, lithium, anticonvulsants, opiate blocking agents, propranolol, nadolol, and clonidine, deserve more clinical research in pediatric aggression. These medications may offer effective and less toxic alternatives in the pharmacologic treatment of inappropriate excessive childhood aggression.",3502,0,0

"5","hypnotizability, pain threshold, and dissociative experiences","Background: There may be an association between pain threshold, hypnotizability, and dissociative experiences. The purpose of the present study was to examine this association. Methods: Forty-one healthy subjects were included in the study. Pain thresholds were determined using a manual algometer. The Dissociative Experiences Scale was administered to all subjects. Hypnotizability of the subjects was assessed by the eye roll sign of the Hypnotic Induction Profile. There were 14, 15, and 12 subjects in the Grade 1, 2, and 3 groups, respectively. Results: Highly hypnotizable subjects had lower pain thresholds and were more likely to report dissociative experiences than the less hypnotizable subjects. Conclusions: There is an association between pain threshold, hypnotizability, and dissociative experiences. It may be suggested that dissociative and somatic symptoms may be integrally linked and related to hypnotic suggestibility.",3465,0,0

"8","associations between dimensions of anxiety sensitivity and ptsd symptom clusters in active-duty police officers","Prior studies have shown that anxiety sensitivity (AS) plays an important role in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate associations between empirically supported PTSD symptom clusters (i.e. reexperiencing, avoidance, numbing, hyperarousal) and AS dimensions (i.e. psychological concerns, social concerns, somatic concerns). Participants were 138 active-duty police officers (70.7% female; mean age = 38.9 years; mean time policing = 173.8 months) who, as a part of a larger study, completed measures of trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, AS, and depressive symptoms. All participants reported experiencing at least one event that they perceived as traumatic, and 44 (31.9%) screened positive for PTSD. Officers with probable PTSD scored significantly higher on AS total as well as the somatic and psychological concerns dimensional scores than did those without PTSD. As well, a higher percentage of officers with probable PTSD scored positively on the AS-derived Brief Screen for Panic Disorder (Apfeldorf et al., 1994) compared with those without PTSD. A series of regression analyses revealed that depressive symptoms, number of reported traumas, and AS somatic concerns were significant predictors of PTSD total symptom severity as well as severity of reexperiencing. Avoidance was predicted by depressive symptoms and AS somatic concerns. Only depressive symptoms were significantly predictive of numbing and hyperarousal cluster scores. These findings contribute to understanding the nature of association between AS and PTSD symptom clusters. Implications for the treatment of individuals having PTSD with and without panic-related symptomatology are discussed.",5952,0,0

Fifty-seven men and 114 women with BPD were included in the study. Regarding Axis I and II disorders in an exploratory analysis, men with BPD more often fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for binge eating disorder, antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and conduct disorder in childhood, whereas women had higher frequencies of bulimia nervosa, posttraumatic stress disorder, and panic disorder with agoraphobia. After correcting for multiple tests, only the gender differences in narcissistic and antisocial personality disorder remained significant. In the SCL-90-R profile, no significant gender differences could be identified. In the exploratory analysis of the dimensional personality traits, women showed higher rates on the NEO-PI-R main factors (Neuroticism and Agreeableness) compared to men. In the DAPP-BQ profile, men reached higher sores on the main factor, Dissocial Behavior. When correcting for multiple tests, gender differences still existed for Neuroticism and Dissocial Behavior. Our results argue for gender differences in Axis I and II comorbidity and dimensional personality traits in BPD.

"13","secondary prevention for police officers involved in job-related psychological stressful or traumatic situations","Objectives: Police officers are at high risk of being exposed to psychologically straining situations and potentially psychotraumatic experiences. In this article, such situations are exemplified and categorized, and the role and significance of secondary prevention following traumatic experiences is discussed. Methods: From 1994 to 2003, 649 police officers received secondary prevention after being involved in a total of 250 potentially traumatic or psychologically stressful incidents. Psychological support was provided by teams of specially trained professionals in the acute phase after the incident following careful psychological evaluation. In a retrospective evaluation, the diagnoses obtained were analyzed with regard to sex and age and correlated with the severity of the incident. Three dusters of potentially traumatic situations were formed: (1) Employment of fire-arms with danger for the officer, (2) Standard situations including violence towards a third party, (3) Suicide or attempted suicide of a police officer. Results: Police officers who experienced events assigned to cluster (1), comprising situations with considerable traumatic potential, had the highest incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental illness. Compared to male officers, females were more often diagnosed with other mental illness, whereas males had a higher incidence of PTSD. Cluster (2), which comprised situations of an officer's daily professional life, was not associated with an increased risk of mental illness. Officers were apparently capable of coping with situations considered psychologically straining for the general public without detectable evidence of a traumatic reaction. In cluster (3), which reflects the most dramatic interference with team relations, other forms of mental illness were diagnosed at a higher incidence.",1729,0,0

The study examined the long-term course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by analyzing rates of recurrence and the predictive value of comorbid psychiatric disorders and psychosocial functioning. Methods. This study is based on diagnostic assessments administered at intake and subsequent follow-up interviews over a period of 15 years in a sample of 90 anxiety-disordered patients with comorbid PTSD who participated in the Harvard Brown Anxiety Research project (HARP). KaplanMeier life table analysis revealed a 0.20 probability of full remission during the 15 years of follow-up. Results. Latent growth model (LGM) analysis revealed that the number of trauma exposures was a predictor of a worse course of PTSD but only during some intervals of the 15-year follow-up. Subjects with full social phobia were more likely to experience worsening of PTSD over time in comparison with subjects with less severe social phobia. Role functioning in the areas of household and employment was a significant predictor of a declining course of PTSD. Conclusions. These findings revealed the dynamic nature of the predictive value of traumatic experiences, the deleterious effect of social phobia and the long term effect of psychosocial functioning on the course of PTSD. Implications for treatment planning and development of interventions for PTSD are discussed. (copyright) 2013 Informa Healthcare.",1185,1,0

Aims: This study addressed these limitations using a population-based, prospective cohort of US military personnel deployed in support of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Method: The sample consisted of US military service members in all branches including active duty, reserve and national guard who deployed once (n = 3393) or multiple times (n = 4394). Self-reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress were obtained prior to deployment and at two follow-ups spaced 3 years apart. Data were examined for longitudinal trajectories using latent growth mixture modelling. Results: Each analysis revealed remarkably similar post-traumatic stress trajectories across time. The most common pattern was low-stable post-traumatic stress or resilience (83.1% single deployers, 84.9% multiple deployers), moderate-improving (8.0%, 8.5%), then worsening-chronic post-traumatic stress (6.7%, 4.5%), high-stable (2.2% single deployers only) and high-improving (2.2% multiple deployers only). Covariates associated with each trajectory were identified. Conclusions: The final models exhibited similar types of trajectories for single and multiple deployers; most notably, the stable trajectory of low post-traumatic stress pre- to post-deployment, or resilience, was exceptionally high. Several factors predicting trajectories were identified, which we hope will assist in future research aimed at decreasing the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder among deployers.

These included an Intermediate Disturbance class (50.0%) and two Pervasive Disturbance classes, which differed with respect to severity of avoidance symptoms (Pervasive Disturbance-Low Avoidance: 33.5%, Pervasive Disturbance-High Avoidance: 16.5%). A greater number of traumatic events predicted membership in the Pervasive Disturbance classes. The Pervasive Disturbance-Low Avoidance class had a higher level of education than the Pervasive Disturbance-High Avoidance class.

DESIGN: Evaluation performed at baseline, and 3 and 6 months postrandomization as part of a longitudinal trial. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS: A total of 1,185 participants, with a mean (±SD) age of 73.53 (±5.98) years, at seven primary care sites (including five Veterans Affairs clinics), were divided into four groups, namely, no trauma (n = 661), trauma only (n = 319), partial PTSD (n = 114), and PTSD (n = 81), based on reports of trauma and associated PTSD symptoms. MEASUREMENTS: The prevalence of comorbid depression, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders, assessed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition, criteria and changes in MHQoL, as assessed by the Short Form-36 mental component score. RESULTS: At baseline, the PTSD group had higher frequencies of comorbid depression and anxiety disorders and worse MHQoL than the other groups. Both chronic (participants diagnosed with PTSD at all three assessments) and fluctuating (participants moving to or from one of the other groups) trajectories of PTSD's course were observed during the follow-up period, which appeared to be separate from that of the comorbid disorders. Even after accounting for those comorbid disorders, PTSD had an independent association with poorer MHQoL at multiple time points, especially in men, whereas trauma without PTSD symptoms (trauma only) had better MHQoL.

"38","ptsd is a chronic, fluctuating disorder affecting the mental quality of life in older adults","OBJECTIVES: Examine the longitudinal course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in older adults and its influence on mental health quality of life (MHQoL). DESIGN: Evaluation performed at baseline, and 3 and 6 months postrandomization as part of a longitudinal trial. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS: A total of 1,185 participants, with a mean (±SD) age of 73.53 (±5.98) years, at seven primary care sites (including five Veterans Affairs clinics), were divided into four groups, namely, no trauma (n = 661), trauma only (n = 319), partial PTSD (n = 114), and PTSD (n = 81), based on reports of trauma and associated PTSD symptoms. MEASUREMENTS: The prevalence of comorbid depression, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders, assessed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition, criteria and changes in MHQoL, as assessed by the Short Form-36 mental component score. RESULTS: At baseline, the PTSD group had higher frequencies of comorbid depression and anxiety disorders and worse MHQoL than the other groups. Both chronic (participants diagnosed with PTSD at all three assessments) and fluctuating (participants moving to or from one of the other groups) trajectories of PTSD's course were observed during the follow-up period, which appeared to be separate from that of the comorbid disorders. Even after accounting for those comorbid disorders, PTSD had an independent association with poorer MHQoL at multiple time points, especially in men, whereas trauma without PTSD symptoms (trauma only) had better MHQoL. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD had chronic and fluctuating courses, with negative effects on MHQoL, while partial PTSD might represent a transitional state, underscoring the need to better identify and treat PTSD at any phase in later life.",12424,0,0

Results: Forty-three patients with PNES diagnosed by Video-EEG were included. Twenty-four had pure PNES, and ninteen mixed PNES. Female population, age, duration of PNES, psychiatric institutionalization, psychopharmacotherapy, dissociative disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), were significantly higher in the pure PNES patients. Suicide attempts, antiepileptic therapy, conversive, affective and personality disorders were frequent in both groups. In the analysis of seizure semiology, the total lack of responsiveness was significantly higher in the mixed PNES group. Conclusions: Pure PNES patients showed similarities and differences in the psychiatric profile, with a greater prevalence of dissociative disorders and PTSD, factors related to psychiatric severity. © 2006 British Epilepsy Association.",10088,0,0

"43","ptsd and depression among displaced chinese workers after the world trade center attack: a follow-up study","We conducted a follow-up assessment to assess the development of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression among Chinese immigrants after the World Trade Center attack. Sixty-five Chinese displaced workers who were originally interviewed in May 2002 were re-interviewed in March 2003. Whereas depression scores decreased over time, average PTSD scores remained unchanged. The trajectory of posttraumatic stress symptoms was more complex, with an increasing number of individuals who show no or little emotional health problems and another increasing group of individuals with exacerbated posttraumatic stress symptoms. Although the mean values of the re-experiencing and hypervigilance cluster did not change over time, the mean value of the avoidance/numbing cluster increased significantly from time 1 (M = 4.60, SD = 4.98) to time 2 (M = 6.34, SD = 4.24), (F1.61 = 5.69, P = .02). A higher proportion of subjects met diagnostic criteria of PTSD at time 2 (27%) than at time 1 (21%). The study highlights the importance of ongoing mental health surveillance of diverse cultural and linguistic groups after a major traumatic event. (copyright) The Author 2005.

This study considers two surveys conducted in Kosovo 8 years after the Balkans war and in Rwanda 14 years after the genocide. METHODS: All participants (n = 864 in Kosovo; n = 962 in Rwanda) were interviewed using the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive episode (MDE) sections of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS: Proportions of participants who met diagnostic criteria for either PTSD or MDE were 33.0% in Kosovo and 31.0% in Rwanda, with co-occurrence of both disorders in 17.8% of the Rwandan sample and 9.5% of the Kosovan sample. Among patients with PTSD, patterns of symptoms significantly differed in the two settings, with avoidance and inability to recall less frequent and sense of a foreshortened future and increased startle response more common in Rwanda. Significant differences were also observed in patients with MDE, with loss of energy and difficulties concentrating less frequent and suicidal ideation more common in Rwanda. Comorbid PTSD and MDE were associated with decreased SF-36 subjective mental and physical health scores in both settings, but significantly larger effects in Kosovo than in Rwanda. CONCLUSION: Culturally different civilian populations exposed to mass trauma may differ with respect to their long-term mental health outcome, including comorbidity, symptom profile and health perception.",6151,0,0

"68","the use of antidepressant drugs in dermatology","This paper provides an updated review of the use of antidepressant drugs in dermatology. Some of the psychiatric disorders that are usually comorbid with dermatological disorders and respond to antidepressants include major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, social phobia and post-traumatic stress disorder usually secondary to trauma and abuse during early life. Cutaneous symptoms may be the feature of a primary psychiatric disorder, e.g. cutaneous body image problems, dermatitis artefacta, neurotic excoriations and trichotillomania, or psychiatric syndromes may be comorbid with a primary dermatological disorder such as the association of major depressive disorder or social phobia with psoriasis and obsessive compulsive disorder with acne excoriee. Some of the salient pharmacological properties of the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are reviewed. The review indicates that the SSRI antidepressants are potentially beneficial in the management of all the major psychiatric syndromes that are encountered in dermatological disorders. The generally more favourable side-effect profile of the SSRIs, such as lower cardiotoxicity in contrast to the TCAs, has made them the first-line agents for the treatment of depression. Furthermore, some of the pharmacological properties of the antidepressant agents that are not related to their antidepressant activity, such as the histamine H1 blocking effect of TCAs, such as doxepin, amitriptyline and trimipramine, are of benefit in dermatological conditions such as urticaria and pruritus. This paper reviews the general guidelines for use of antidepressants and salient drug-drug interactions resulting mainly from the inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and 3A3/4 isoenzymes by some of the SSRI antidepressants. Before prescribing an antidepressant agent, the specific guidelines, side-effect profile, drug-drug interactions and most current indications should always be obtained.",2256,0,0

Children completed measures of connectedness, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and benefit-finding. Parents also reported on children's PTSS. RESULTS: Latent profile analysis revealed four profiles: high connectedness (45%), low connectedness (6%), connectedness primarily to parents (40%), and connectedness primarily to peers (9%). These profiles did not differ by history of cancer. However, profiles differed on PTSS and benefit-finding. Children highly connected across domains displayed the lowest PTSS and highest benefit-finding, while those with the lowest connectedness had the highest PTSS, with moderate PTSS and benefit-finding for the parent and peer profiles.

These complications may affect the relatives' ability to perform the role of a caregiver and it can also hinder their daily functioning. Apart from negative psychological consequences experienced after a loved one's stay in the ICU, there are also some positive changes observed in patient's relatives called posttraumatic growth. In this review, the psychological repercussions in the ICU patient's family and the means to prevent their undesirable responses are discussed.",252,0,0

"91","altered functional connectivity in posttraumatic stress disorder with versus without comorbid major depressive disorder: a resting state fmri study","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that is often diagnosed with comorbid depressive disorder. Therefore, neuroimaging studies investigating PTSD typically include both patients with and without comorbid depression. Differences in activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula have been shown to differentiate PTSD patients with and without major depressive disorder (MDD). Whether or not comorbid MDD affects resting state functional connectivity of PTSD patients has not been investigated to our knowledge. Here, resting state functional connectivity of PTSD patients with (PTSD+MDD; n=27) and without (PTSD-MDD; n=23) comorbid MDD was investigated. The subgenual ACC and insula were investigated as seed regions. Connectivity between the subgenual ACC and perigenual parts of the ACC was increased in PTSD+MDD versus PTSD-MDD, which may reflect the presence of depressive specific symptoms such as rumination. Functional connectivity of the subgenual ACC with the thalamus was reduced, potentially related to more severe deficits in executive functioning in the PTSD+MDD group versus the PTSD-MDD group. In addition, the PTSD+MDD group showed reduced functional connectivity of the insula with the hippocampus compared to the PTSD-MDD group. However, this cluster was no longer significantly different when PTSD patients that were using medication were excluded from analyses. Thus, resting state functional connectivity of the subgenual ACC can distinguish PTSD+MDD from PTSD-MDD, and this may therefore be used as a neurobiological marker for comorbid MDD in the presence of PTSD. As PTSD+MDD are more treatment resistant, these findings can also guide treatment development, for example by targeting the subgenual ACC network with treatment.",6295,0,0

"93","the factor structure of psychiatric comorbidity among iraq/afghanistan-era veterans and its relationship to violence, incarceration, suicide attempts, and suicidality","The present research examined how incarceration, suicide attempts, suicidality, and difficulty controlling violence relate to the underlying factor structure of psychiatric comorbidity among a large sample of Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans (N=1897). Diagnostic interviews established psychiatric diagnoses; self-report measures assessed history of incarceration, difficulty controlling violence, suicide attempts, and suicidality. A 3-factor measurement model characterized by latent factors for externalizing-substance-use disorders (SUD), distress, and fear provided excellent fit to the data. Alcohol-use disorder, drug-use disorder, and nicotine dependence were indicators on the externalizing-SUD factor. Posttraumatic stress disorder and depression were indicators on the distress factor. Panic disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder were indicators on the fear factor. Incarceration was exclusively predicted by the externalizing-SUD factor. Difficulty controlling violence, suicidality, and suicide attempts were exclusively predicted by the distress factor. Contrary to hypotheses, the path from the externalizing/SUD factor to difficulty controlling violence was not significant. Taken together, these findings suggest that the distress factor of psychiatric comorbidity is a significant risk factor for suicidality, suicide attempts, and difficulty controlling violence and could help to explain the frequent co-occurrence of these critical outcomes among returning Iraq/Afghanistan veterans.",245,0,0

It is characterized by three clusters of symptoms. The course of PTSD is often chronic and impedes individual's functioning. Studies of PTSD treatment with paroxetine provide evidence for its efficacy in reducing symptoms and its favorable profile of side-effects. The objective of this work was to determine the efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of PTSD. The sample consisted of 30 subjects with chronic PTSD. All subjects received treatment with paroxetine in therapeutic dose range for six months. Subjects were assessed prior to therapy and following six months of treatment with paroxetine with the use of following instruments: SCL 90-R, Mississippi Questionnaire, and CGI. The results indicate statistically significant reduction on all subscales of SCL 90-R following six months of treatment, P<0,05. The difference between two assessments with Mississippi Questionnaire was statistically significant, P< 0,05. PTSD rate in our sample was reduced from 100% before treatment to 64% after treatment. Paroxetine was administered in daily dose of 20 mg in 88% of the subjects, and 40 mg in the remaining 12%. Unwanted effects were registered in 16,7% of the subjects and they were mild. Objective improvement was registered in 84% of the sample, and subjective improvement was registered in 80%. Reduction of relapse symptoms was registered in 24% of the subjects.

The objective of this study is to examine how heterogeneous posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) trajectories are associated with postdeployment suicidal ideation in veterans 2.5 years postdeployment to a combat zone in Afghanistan. If PTSD trajectories are associated with postdeployment suicidal ideations, then the accumulative knowledge on what characterizes veterans falling into different PTSD trajectories may provide better opportunities for early identification of suicidal high-risk veterans. Method: In this prospective study of 743 Danish soldiers deployed to Afghanistan from February to August in 2009, we collected data at 6 time points from 6 weeks before deployment to 2.5 years after homecoming (total for this study: 456). At all assessments, the soldiers responded to a comprehensive questionnaire including measures of PTSD (measured by the PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version) and other mental and physical health variables, demographics, and social and combat-related factors. Suicidal ideation was measured by an item from the European Parasuicide Study Interview Schedule II. In a previous study based on soldiers from this cohort, we identified 6 PTSD trajectories using latent growth mixture modeling, which we have extracted and applied as independent variables in this study. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied to examine whether deployed soldiers with certain PTSD symptom trajectories were more likely to report suicidal ideation 2.5 years after homecoming. Results:Two PTSD trajectories with high PTSD symptom level 2.5 years after return were significantly associated with suicidal Ideation 2.5 years after homecoming. Thus, a relieved-worsening class, described by initial decreasing PTSD symptom levels followed by a steep increase in symptoms had higher risk of suicidal ideation (OR= 7.84; 95% CI, 1.68-36.6), which was also the case for a late-onset class (OR 5.2; 95% CI, 2.21-12.24) when compared to a low-stable class.

The most frequently implemented approach is to treat patients suffering from the diagnosis of PTSD.

Data about efficacy of monoamine oxidase inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of PTSD are heterogeneous. Data are relatively consistent with regards of efficacy of SSRIs in the treatment of civilian, predominantly female population, regardless of the type of trauma: interpersonal or non-interpersonal trauma. Placebo controlled trial data in the treatment of combat-related PTSD are inconclusive or negative. Three recently published studies provide new approaches to the treatment of male patients, suffering from combat-related PTSD. A relatively young, recently traumatized male, combat-related population showed significant improvement for fluoxetine compared to placebo. An adjuvant 5HT2 antagonist profile may improve the SSRI effect in the treatment of PTSD: nefazodone was significantly superior compared to placebo in the treatment of combat-related PTSD, and risperidone treatment add-on to antidepressants showed significant benefits compared to antidepressant monotherapy in the treatment of combat-related PTSD. The goal of sedative paradigm is to minimize the immediate consequences of the traumatic stress, decrease the fear, anxiety and sleeplessness. Data published about benzodiazepines failed to show effectiveness in the acute management of post-traumatic mental consequences. The intention of the third treatment paradigm is characterized by the secondary prevention of PTSD. Benzodiazepines administered shortly after the traumatic event, failed to prevent the mental consequences of traumatic stress. Two small trials with propranolol administration after the trauma have been shown some benefits compared to placebo or no treatment. PTSD represents a complex disregulation of numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, therefore the complex pharmacological treatment has to consider approaches beyond the current treatment regimens characterized by modulation of monoamine neurotransmission.",1709,0,0

Objective: To analyze the extent to which the symptoms attributable to mobbing are misidentified with criteria for two paranoid spectrum nosologies (delusional disorder and paranoid personality disorder). Methods: Literature review of PubMed and SciELO from 1990 to June 2009. Results: The identification of paranoid spectrum symptoms in victims of mobbing is not consistent with the literature, which, by contrast, shows a notable presence of symptoms in the post-traumatic stress spectrum (as much as 92%), although they do not meet the A1 criterion for this nosology. Some of the causes of wrong diagnosis are noted, such as a tendency to confuse hypervigilance (D4 criterion for post-traumatic stress disorder in DSM-IV-TR) with paranoid ideation, the existence of a defensive profile in victims of WPH, and lack of recognition on the part of clinicians of the stressful and traumatizing impact of mobbing. Discussion: Longitudinal and mixed methodology (qualitative and quantitative) studies are necessary in order to establish robust differential diagnosis criteria that clearly distinguish the clinical manifestations attributable to workplace harassment from paranoid spectrum symptoms.",2105,0,0

Methods: Literature review of PubMed and SciELO from 1990 to June 2009. Results: The identification of paranoid spectrum symptoms in victims of mobbing is not consistent with the literature, which, by contrast, shows a notable presence of symptoms in the post-traumatic stress spectrum (as much as 92%), although they do not meet the A1 criterion for this nosology. Some of the causes of wrong diagnosis are noted, such as a tendency to confuse hypervigilance (D4 criterion for post-traumatic stress disorder in DSM-IV-TR) with paranoid ideation, the existence of a defensive profile in victims of WPH, and lack of recognition on the part of clinicians of the stressful and traumatizing impact of mobbing. Discussion: Longitudinal and mixed methodology (qualitative and quantitative) studies are necessary in order to establish robust differential diagnosis criteria that clearly distinguish the clinical manifestations attributable to workplace harassment from paranoid spectrum symptoms.",9522,0,0

Because responses to stress can vary widely, the absence of a suitable, pathophysiologically based taxonomy of stress responses has hindered physicians in their efforts to devise treatments tailored to deal with specific stress-related problems. It is proposed herein that classical endocrinologic criteria be employed to characterize stress responses in terms of the associated hormonal secretion ratios and their temporal evolution. Ratios of the responses to stressors of the sympathoadrenal system (SA) and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis can be either unity (ratio = 1) or dissociated in varying degree, with SA or HPA dominance and for more or less prolonged periods. Published reports of studies in both laboratory animals and patients with stress-associated illnesses (eg, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) suggest that such hormone-secretion ratios together with their temporal patterns can be used to characterize the particular stress response under examination, thereby providing strong support for further study of the proposed taxonomy. Such a classification of responses to stress stimuli will make it possible to test the overall concept by establishing a correspondence between the suggested hormonal profile and the associated clinical/psychological picture, as well as enable assessment of the benefit of a therapeutic strategy designed to fit the particular category of stress response exhibited by the patient.

METHODS: This study is based on diagnostic assessments administered at intake and subsequent follow-up interviews over a period of 15 years in a sample of 90 anxiety-disordered patients with comorbid PTSD who participated in the Harvard Brown Anxiety Research project (HARP). Kaplan-Meier life table analysis revealed a 0.20 probability of full remission during the 15 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Latent growth model (LGM) analysis revealed that the number of trauma exposures was a predictor of a worse course of PTSD but only during some intervals of the 15-year follow-up. Subjects with full social phobia were more likely to experience worsening of PTSD over time in comparison with subjects with less severe social phobia. Role functioning in the areas of household and employment was a significant predictor of a declining course of PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed the dynamic nature of the predictive value of traumatic experiences, the deleterious effect of social phobia and the long term effect of psychosocial functioning on the course of PTSD.

"144","the relation between personality disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder","The relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and personality disorder was assessed in Croatian soldiers who experienced war psycho trauma. The research included two groups of soldiers: PTSD group included 50 soldiers treated at hospital and diagnosed as PTSD, and PTSD+PD group included 50 soldiers treated at hospital and diagnosed as both PTSD and personality disorder. Using CAPS-2 assessment scale, the PTSD+PD group were found to demonstrate a higher intensity of PTSD symptoms not only in the total score, but also in the diagnostic cells of feeling of being deprived of the future, and irritability with fits of anger. Personality dimensions were examined by MMPI-1, and the results showed the PTSD group to have a depressive-paranoid profile (D-Pa), whereas PTSD+PD group had a depressive-psychasthenic profile (D-Pt). Using the application of EPQ/A questionnaire, both groups were found to have high psychotic and neurotic features and low extraversion, while the EPQ/IVE questionnaire recorded high impulsion and low adventurism and empathy. There was no significant difference between the groups. It is concluded that exposure to war psychotrauma leads to significant personality changes in premorbidly healthy persons, which makes it hard to differentiate them from the persons with personality disorder. The symptoms of PTSD act synergistically with the symptoms of primary personality pathology, resulting in more serious clinical features of PTSD in the persons suffering from personality disorder than in healthy persons.",1742,0,0

"146","antipsychotics in the treatment of anxiety disorders","Introduction: Antipsychotics were used in the treatment of pathological anxiety by several generations of psychiatrists despite the insufficient evidence. Because of their somewhat improved safety profile, especially second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are increasingly used for the treatment of non-psychotic anxiety. Method: The resources for this literature review were obtained from the National Library of Medicine PubMed database and Web of Science, including the ones published between the years 1991-2011. Additional references were found through bibliography reviews of relevant articles. Results: There is moderate evidence supporting the use of some antipsychotics, either as adjunctive treatment or monotherapy, in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Despite the limitations of the trials reviewed, atypical antipsychotics represent a promising treatment modality when considering their improved side effect profile compared to conventional agents. The facts to date do not warrant the use of SGAs as first-line monotherapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, some patients with highly refractory anxiety disorders may benefit from the judicious and carefully monitored use of adjunctive SGAs. A careful risk-benefit assessment, on a case-by-case basis, must be undertaken by the physician. Conclusions: Benefits and harms vary among antipsychotic medications for off-label use in anxiety disorders. With respect to the double-blind randomized controlled studies only quetiapine was associated with benefits in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder; risperidone and haloperidol were associated with benefits in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and risperidone in PTSD.",1279,0,0

PTSD and depressive symptoms indicated distress and resilient attitudes, and satisfaction with quality of life indicated resources. We also analysed potential complementary dynamics between family members and identified family types according to their distress and resources. Concerning trauma impact, we hypothesized that exposure to family military violence (FMV) and recent personal trauma (RPT) predict family members' psychological distress and resources differently, indicating asymmetry in family responses. The participants were 65 Palestinian families each consisting of a mother, a father and their 15-, 17 and 19-year-old children. The within-family MANOVA results showed asymmetric in psychological distress and resources in sibling and spousal subsystems, for example older siblings reported a higher level of depressive symptoms than both parents, and mothers reported PTSD more often than fathers. The cluster analysis identified four family types, two with symmetric responses: In the ""resilient families"" all members showed low distress and high resources, and in the ""ordeal families"" all showed distress and low resources. In the asymmetric families either the children or the parents showed low distress and high resources, named the ""children's strength families"" and the ""parental strength families"", respectively. Partial correlation analysis revealed complementary dynamics between children and their parents: If mothers reported high levels of psychological distress, the 15 and 17-year-olds reported low or vice versa. Spousal complementary dynamics were found in psychosocial resources: If the mother showed highly resilient attitudes, the father showed low or vice versa.

This article discusses the role of these differences in the selection of a particular agent. Since the SSRIs inhibit neuronal serotonin reuptake and have minimal effects on sites affected by other antidepressants, the SSRIs have a different pharmacodynamic and tolerability profile from other antidepressants. The SSRIs are effective in treating many disorders, including major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic attacks, bulimia, alcoholism, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and perhaps migraine headaches.

"161","children against children: bullying as an emerging disorder","An increasing number of children are consulting for various problems or disorders that are based on mistreatment at school. Bullying is defined as persistent physical or emotional violence by a school-aged child or group of children against another school-aged child who is unable to defend himself in this situation, which takes place in the school area. This type of behavior involves the aggressor, the victim, the group of classmates, the institution (teachers, the psychopedagogic team, the management team) and the families (those of the aggressor and victim, and the parents association). Bullying is a type of disorder that can be included in some of the typologies described by Terr in Postraumatic Stress Disorder in childhood, specifically in type II or chronic disorder and in type III or mixed disorder (chronic with phases of acute reactivation). Longitudinal studies have reported an association between having been bullied at school and the possibility of suffering from mobbing, mostly in the form of work harassment. Surprisingly, there can be a ""pact of silence"" between classmates. Schools are perceived as being more tolerant with the aggressors than with the victims of bullying.",3197,0,0

"163","post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol use disorder","Our clinical observations along with data in the literature have shown an increased incidence of alcohol use disorder in persons who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. In this work we examined alcohol use disorder in war veterans who were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (group 1) (n = 52) and compared them with veterans who were traumatized but who had not developed a clinical picture of post-traumatic stress disorder (group 2) (n = 29) and a sample from the general population (group 3) (n = 30). The objective of this work was to establish the cluster symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder that are related to alcohol use disorder and connected with depression. All of the respondents were males. The methods used were structured clinical interviews for the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders axis I disorders for addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder and Beck's scale for depression. The results obtained showed that there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of alcohol use disorder between traumatized patients who had and those who had not developed post-traumatic stress disorder, but there was a significant statistical difference for both groups 1 and 2 in relation to the control group. The variables that correlated positively with alcohol use disorder were the cluster symptoms of re-experiencing and the arousal symptom of the traumatized group and there was also increased depression in both groups examined (groups 1 and 2).",2249,0,0

"165","a comparative study of trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder prevalence in epilepsy patients and psychogenic nonepileptic seizure patients","Purpose: This study tests the hypothesis that trauma histories, including histories of physical and sexual abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more prevalent in psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (NES) patients than in epilepsy patients. Methods: Thirty-five inpatients with intractable seizures were evaluated for trauma history and PTSD. After these assessments, patients were diagnosed as having either epileptic or nonepileptic seizures through EEG monitoring. Results: NES diagnosis correlated with PTSD and total number of lifetime traumas, adult traumas, and abuse traumas. Contrary to previous hypotheses, reported childhood sexual abuse (CSA) did not correlate significantly with NES diagnosis. However, CSA predicted PTSD in a discriminant analysis. Conclusions: We found evidence for the hypothesized relations between trauma, abuse, PTSD, and NES diagnosis. However, elevated levels in both seizure-disorder groups suggest that routine assessment for abuse, trauma, and PTSD might facilitate medical care and treatment for all intractable seizure patients.",1831,0,0

The model incorporates properties of neurophysiology including axonal transmission delays, synapto-dendritic rates, range-dependent connectivities, excitatory and inhibitory neural populations, and intrathalamic, intracortical, corticocortical and corticothalamic pathways. This study tests the ability of the model to determine unique physiological properties in a number of different data sets varying in mean age and pathology. The model is used to fit individual electroencephalographic (EEG) spectra from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, first episode schizophrenia (FESz), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and their age/sex matched controls. The results demonstrate that the model is able to distinguish each group in terms of a unique cluster of abnormal parameter deviations. The abnormal physiology inferred from these parameters is also consistent with known theoretical and experimental findings from each disorder.

Since some of the blind veterans manifested distinct features of PTSP, it was necessary to consider this fact. For establising the correlation between the rehabilitation and the mastering of the independent mobility technique robust discriminative analysis was implemented. The aim was to determine to what extent the process of rehabilitation contributed to mastering of the essential independent mobility techniques. However, since great part of the rehabilitated veterans manifested distinct features of PTSP, first was necessary to partialize the impact of PTSP. This was implemented by the convariance analysis or the discriminative analysis with partialization of the impact of PTSP.

In the last decades researchers of HT programs have attempted to identify the existence of psychosocial factors that might influence the clinical outcome before and after the transplantation. The main objective of this study was to describe epidemiological, psychiatric and psychological features of a large sample of HT candidates. Methods: Cross-sectional, observational and descriptive study. A psychiatric and psychological assessment of 125 adult patients was performed at the moment of being included in the HT waiting list, between 2006 and 2012. The assessment consisted in: Clinical, epidemiological and psychosocial form; Spanish version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis I disorders; Coping questionnaire (COPE); Five Factors Inventory Revised (NEO-FFI-R); Apgar-Family questionnaire and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scale. Results: Axis I diagnoses were present in a 30.4% of patients. COPE showed that this group of patients used most frequently engagement strategies. Personality factors profile of NEO-FFI-R were similar to general population and locus of control scale also presented similar scores compared with other chronic diagnostic groups. Statistically significant associations were found between personality factors and COPE scales/dimensions and psychopathology, mainly neuroticism and disengagement. Conclusions: This is the first study to assess systematically psychosocial factors in a large sample of HT candidates. We have found that around one third of these patients have a psychiatric disorder. Neuroticism and disengagement coping styles can serve as markers of emotional distress.",5290,0,0

"182","understanding implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks and storms: medical and psychosocial considerations for research and clinical care","The experience of shock is the distinguishing feature for patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and is associated with diminished psychological functioning and quality of life. Multiple shocks and ICD storm are a relatively common event among patients with ICDs (10-20%) and may present specific challenging medical and psychological management for the attending health care providers. This paper examines the medical and psychological aspects of ICD shocks and storms and describes a model of biopsychosocial management for patients following the experience of ICD storm. Successful management of patients post shock includes the use of antiarrhythmic medications and careful attention to the causality of the shocks via stored electrograms. The psychological management includes specific attention to debriefing post-shock feelings and attributions, preventing avoidance behavior, and facilitating positive ""return to life"" actions. Preliminary research examining formal psychosocial treatment supports a cognitive behavioral strategy to reduce psychological distress and facilitate quality of life. Collectively, these data suggest that interdisciplinary management of patients with multiple ICD shocks or the experience of ICD storm is advised, and routine psychological consultation may be indicated for the patient post ICD storm to reduce the possibility of symptoms of post-traumatic stress.",10439,0,0

"186","trauma signature analysis of the great east japan disaster: guidance for psychological consequences","OBJECTIVES: On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced the largest earthquake in its history. The undersea earthquake launched a tsunami that inundated much of Japan's eastern coastline and damaged nuclear power plants, precipitating multiple reactor meltdowns. We examined open-source disaster situation reports, news accounts, and disaster-monitoring websites to gather event-specific data to conduct a trauma signature analysis of the event. METHODS: The trauma signature analysis included a review of disaster situation reports; the construction of a hazard profile for the earthquake, tsunami, and radiation threats; enumeration of disaster stressors by disaster phase; identification of salient evidence-based psychological risk factors; summation of the trauma signature based on exposure to hazards, loss, and change; and review of the mental health and psychosocial support responses in relation to the analysis. RESULTS: Exposure to this triple-hazard event resulted in extensive damage, significant loss of life, and massive population displacement. Many citizens were exposed to multiple hazards. The extremity of these exposures was partially mitigated by Japan's timely, expert-coordinated, and unified activation of an evidence-based mental health response. CONCLUSIONS: The eastern Japan disaster was notable for its unique constellation of compounding exposures. Examination of the trauma signature of this event provided insights and guidance regarding optimal mental health and psychosocial responses. Japan orchestrated a model response that reinforced community resilience.",12932,0,0

Being divorced, separated, or widowed (compared to married or never married) and having experienced childhood trauma were related to higher lifetime prevalence but not to current prevalence. In addition, age and education level were related to current 12-month MDD. Data on the profile of MDD in urban Mexico are provided.

"194","traumatic stress after childbirth: the role of obstetric variables","In a sample of 1550 recently delivered women, traumatic stress after childbirth was studied in relation to obstetric variables. A post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom profile and traumatic stress symptoms were assessed by means of the Traumatic Event Scale (TES). Obstetric data comprised delivery mode, duration of the second stage of labor (the time from cervical dilation of 10 cm to partus) and the use of analgesia/anesthesia. Traumatic stress symptoms and having a PTSD symptom profile were both significantly related to the experience of an emergency cesarean section or an instrumental vaginal delivery. It is of clinical importance, however, that most women with a PTSD symptom profile were found in the normal vaginal delivery group (NVD). This implies that a normal vaginal delivery can be experienced as traumatic, just as an emergency cesarian section is not necessarily traumatic. Traumatic stress symptoms were neither substantially correlated to the duration of the second stage of labor, nor to the use of analgesia/anesthesia.",1781,0,0

Torture for political reasons is an extreme violence in interpersonal relations resulting in not only acute psychiatric disorders but also very often in very severe and far reaching negative consequences for the overall psychosocial functioning of a victim. The aim of this study was to investigate gender differences in types of torture and psychological consequences in subjects who experienced war torture. Methods. A sample (410 men and 76 women) included clients of ""Centre for rehabilitation of torture victims - IAN, Belgrade"" who experienced torture in prisons and concentration camps during civil wars in ex- Yugoslavia 1991-1995 and 1999. Types of Torture Questionnaire with 81 items was used for collecting data about forms of torture. Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90- R) was used for assessing type and intensity of psychological symptoms, and Impact of Event Scale (IES) was used to estimate posttraumatic complaints. Results. A gender difference was found for 33 types of torture: 28 more frequent in men, and 5 in women. Factor analysis of torture types revealed three factors explaining 29% of variance: ""common torture"", ""sadistic torture"", and ""sexual torture"". Discriminant analysis revealed significant gender difference concerning the factors. ""Common torture"" and ""sadistic torture"" were more prominent in men, and ""sexual torture"" was more present in women. Higher scores on depression, anxiety, somatization, interpersonal sensitivity and obsessive- compulsive dimensions on SCL-90-R were found in women. General score and scores of subscales (intrusion and avoidance) on IES were significantly higher in women. Conclusion. Women exposed to war torture experienced less torture techniques and shorter inprisonment than men, but had more frequent and severe symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and other psychological symptoms. Gender differences in posttraumatic symptomatology can not be explained exclusively by gender differences in types of torture found in this study.",4254,0,0

"199","effects of exogenous glucocorticoid on combat-related ptsd symptoms","BACKGROUND: Very few systematic human studies focus on changing the underlying traumatic memory after posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been established. Evidence from animal and human studies indicates that cortisol can be used to address traumatic memories. This translational pilot study is based on our previous rodent research in which extinction of fear memories was enhanced by glucocorticoids. The current study aims to assess the effectiveness of glucocorticoids in augmenting memory extinction and reducing clinical symptoms in veterans with combat-related PTSD. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, veterans with combat-related PTSD were exposed to a memory reactivation task using well established imagery and psychophysiology assessment technique followed by administration of either glucocorticoid or placebo. RESULTS: One week after glucocorticoid or placebo administration, participants who received the study medication showed significant PTSD-related symptom (cluster C) improvement compared with control participants who received placebo only. However, reduction of symptoms degraded at a 1-month postadministration assessment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with a glucocorticoid-mediated enhancement of extinction to ameliorate PTSD symptoms. The use of traumatic memory reactivation temporally paired with glucocorticoid administration holds potential for developing a viable therapeutic option.",1455,0,0

A cluster randomized trial was employed. Subsequent to screening 1,370 children in randomly selected schools, 399 children were assigned to an intervention (n=199) or waitlist control condition (n=200). The intervention consisted of 15 manualized sessions over 5 weeks of cognitive behavioral techniques and creative expressive elements. Assessments took place before, 1 week after, and 3 months after the intervention. Primary outcomes included post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive, and anxiety symptoms. No main effects on primary outcomes were identified. A main effect in favor of intervention for conduct problems was observed. This effect was stronger for younger children. Furthermore, we found intervention benefits for specific subgroups. Stronger effects were found for boys with regard to PTSD and anxiety symptoms, and for younger children on pro-social behavior. Moreover, we found stronger intervention effects on PTSD, anxiety, and function impairment for children experiencing lower levels of current war-related stressors. Girls in the intervention condition showed smaller reductions on PTSD symptoms than waitlisted girls. We conclude that preventive school-based psychosocial interventions in volatile areas characterized by ongoing war-related stressors may effectively improve indicators of psychological wellbeing and posttraumatic stress-related symptoms in some children. However, they may undermine natural recovery for others.

Data stem from a cross-sectional study in a stratified, representative sample of 1483 recently deployed soldiers using standardized diagnostic interviews. All lifetime PTSD symptom clusters (occurrence of any symptom and number of symptoms) were associated with current AUD and ND in crude models except that anxious arousal was not related to AUD. Associations were reduced in magnitude when controlling for comorbidity. Current ND was related to the occurrence of any emotional numbing and to the number of re-experiencing symptoms above the contribution of other symptom clusters and comorbidity. In conclusion, associations between PTSD symptoms, AUD and ND may be partially attributable to additional comorbidity. Findings also yield further evidence for a role of emotional numbing and re-experiencing symptoms in the comorbidity between PTSD and ND and for a distinction between dysphoric and anxious arousal PTSD symptoms.",6105,0,0

Baseline psychometric ratings and physiologic assessments of heart rate and blood pressure responses to individualized, taped trauma scripts were determined for 16 patients with PTSD and 16 mentally healthy age- and gender-matched control subjects exposed to at least 1 serious trauma. Patients with PTSD had greater autonomic reactivity than control subjects at baseline, with physiologic measures correlating with the severity of the PTSD for the combined groups. Discriminant analyses indicated that systolic blood pressure best classified patients with PTSD (75% sensitivity) and control subjects (100% specificity), with a stepwise discriminant analysis showing that combined physiologic variables correctly classified 75% of patients with PTSD and 100% of control subjects. After 10 weeks of fluvoxamine treatment (100-300 mg/day), patients' PTSD, depression, and physiologic reactivity improved significantly. Medicated patients with PTSD could not be distinguished statistically from untreated control subjects in any physiologic measure.

Methods: 150 Croatian war veterans with the diagnosis of chronic combat-related PTSD, who sought treatment at the Department of Psychiatry Osijek, Croatia, and who provided complete data, were selected as the sample for this study from the treatment-seeking group of the ex-soldier populations (N = 192). Structural equation modeling was used to develop an etiological model of relationships of premilitary risk factors, military entry conditions, war zone experiences, dissociative reactions, and homecoming reception with current PTSD symptom clusters. Results: The causal models with satisfactory fit and parsimony were developed. The result analysis suggests that there is a different etiological effect of studied variables on PTSD symptom clusters in all three studied models. War zone experiences, peritraumatic dissociation and homecoming reception have a higher and primary etiological effect in relation to a lower and secondary etiological effect of premilitary risk factors and military entry conditions in all three studied models. The exception is sometimes a higher etiological effect of premilitary risk factors in the causal model for the avoidance symptom cluster and military entry conditions in the causal model for the arousal cluster.

"228","posttraumatic stress after a motor vehicle accident: a six-month follow-up study utilizing latent growth modeling","Features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for 596 survivors of motor vehicle accidents were examined by self-report measures at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the motor vehicle accident (MVA). Latent growth modeling was utilized to study the trend and predictors of the level of distress. Results indicated that 5-20% of the participants reported to have a significant level of posttraumatic stress in one, two, or three of the PTSD symptom clusters within the period studied. Survivors with significant acute stress 1 week after the MVA had a higher risk for developing chronic posttraumatic stress. Although the severity of intrusive and hyperarousal symptoms decreased over time, the severity of avoidance symptoms remained unchanged.

"231","a clinical approach to the pharmacotherapy of aggression in children and adolescents","Overt aggression in its various forms is the most prevalent symptom presenting to pediatric mental health providers, regardless of setting. It is a behavior with a heterogeneous etiology and requires a comprehensive approach to evaluation and treatment. Evaluation of the aggressive child must assess medical, neurologic, psychiatric, psychosocial, familial, and/or educational contributions to behavioral dyscontrol. Multimodal treatment is generally required. At present, there is no single medication to recommend for the treatment of aggressive behavior. Multiple medications have clinically been used in a nonspecific fashion to target excessive childhood aggression. Although successful for some, this approach increases risk for ineffective interventions accompanied by side effects. Until a scientific understanding of the developmental neurobiology of aggression leads to more specific treatment, this review suggests the use of a diagnostic-based approach to the pharmacology of aggression. Descriptive diagnostic techniques should be used to define the presence of any primary or comorbid psychiatric disorder that presents with aggression as an associated symptom. Treating aggression in the context of these psychiatric syndromes appears to be the most direct approach. Aggression occurring in the context of a medication-responsive psychiatric diagnosis appears most sensitive to pharmacologic intervention. Presently, evidence for efficacy is strongest for aggression in the context of ADHD, psychotic disorder, adolescent-onset bipolar disorder, and ictal aggression. It remains less clear that medication can help aggression when it occurs independently of a pharmacologically treatable comorbid psychiatric disorder. Aggression may respond to a target symptom approach where discrete behavioral symptoms that contribute to aggression, such as irritability, explosiveness, fear, or impulsivity, may be modified by medication intervention. When treatment is approached in this fashion, it is standard practice to use the least toxic and safest intervention first. Behavioral treatment based on contingency management principles could be initially recommended. Medication trials should first use medications that have demonstrated empiric efficacy in reducing aggression and that have a favorable safety profile. Neuroleptics to treat aggression in nonpsychotic psychiatrically referred youth should be kept to a minimum, secondary to their significant adverse risk profile. Alternative medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake-inhibiting antidepressants, buspirone, lithium, anticonvulsants, opiate blocking agents, propranolol, nadolol, and clonidine, deserve more clinical research in pediatric aggression. These medications may offer effective and less toxic alternatives in the pharmacologic treatment of inappropriate excessive childhood aggression.",10805,0,0
