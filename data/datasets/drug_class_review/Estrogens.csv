10090424,Oral micronized progesterone.,"Administration, Oral; Animals; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Clinical Trials as Topic; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Female; Humans; Postmenopause; Premenopause; Progesterone; Progesterone Congeners","de Ligni猫res, B","This review sought to examine the rationale for selecting an oral micronized progesterone formulation rather than a synthetic progestin for some of the main indications for progestogens. Unopposed estrogen use is associated with a high risk (relative risk, 2.1 to 5.7) of endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma, and it has been understood for some time that a progestogen must be added for at least 10 to 14 days per month to prevent these effects. However, the most commonly used synthetic progestins, norethisterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate, have been associated with metabolic and vascular side effects (eg, suppression of the vasodilating effect of estrogens) in both experimental and human controlled studies. All comparative studies to date conclude that the side effects of synthetic progestins can be minimized or eliminated through the use of natural progesterone, which is identical to the steroid produced by the corpus luteum. The inconvenience associated with the use of injectable, rectal, or vaginal formulations of natural progesterone can be circumvented by using orally administered micronized progesterone. The bioavailability of micronized progesterone is similar to that of other natural steroids, and interindividual and intraindividual variability of area under the curve is similar to that seen with synthetic progestins. A clear dose-ranging effect has been demonstrated, and long-term protection of the endometrium has been established. Micronized progesterone has been used widely in Europe since 1980 at dosages ranging from 300 mg/d (taken at bedtime) 10 days a month for women wishing regular monthly bleeding to 200 mg 14 days a month or 100 mg 25 days a month for women willing to remain amenorrheic. This therapy is well tolerated, with the only specific side effect being mild and transient drowsiness, an effect minimized by taking the drug at bedtime. The prospective, comparative Postmenopausal Estrogens/Progestin Intervention trial has recommended oral micronized progesterone as the first choice for opposing estrogen therapy in nonhysterectomized postmenopausal women.",E,E

Lumbar (L2-4) and femoral neck bone mineral densities (BMD) were determined by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline, after 2.5 and 5 years of treatment. All new symptomatic non-vertebral, radiographically defined fractures were recorded.; Altogether, 368 women (79%) completed the 5 year treatment. In all, 32 women had 39 non-vertebral fractures during a mean of 4.3 year follow-up (HRT 4, Vit D 10, HRT + Vit D 8 and placebo 17). The reduction in the incidence of new non-vertebral fractures was significant in women with HRT alone (P = 0.032) when adjusted by baseline BMD and previous fractures; observed also with the intention-to-treat principle (P = 0.048). When the HRT groups were pooled, HRT showed a significantly lower incidence of new non-vertebral fractures (P = 0.042) than women receiving placebo and also after adjusting as above (P = 0.016); both in valid-case and in the intention-to-treat analysis. In the Vit D group, the fracture incidence was non-significantly decreased (P = 0.229) in comparison with the placebo group. The estimated risk of new non-vertebral fractures among women treated with HRT alone was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.10-0.90) and with Vit D 0.47 (95% CI, 0.20-1.14) and with HRT + Vit D 0.44 (95% CI, 0.17-1.15), in comparison with the placebo group (adjusted by femoral BMD and previous fractures).; This study is the first prospective trial confirming the beneficial effect of HRT on prevention of peripheral fractures in non-osteoporotic postmenopausal women. The effect of low-dose Vit D remains to be proved.",E,E

During the second complete cycle (i.e., cycle 3), they received estradiol 2 mg orally between days 23 and 28 (premenstrual).; Throughout both cycles 2 and 3, each subject recorded premenstrual symptom questionnaire scores (15 mood and physical symptoms, graded 0-3) every morning on awakening. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and visual analog scales of asthma symptoms (cough, wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness) were recorded daily at the same time. Seven subjects showed a classic pattern of premenstrual symptoms. Four of the five subjects who complained of PMA symptoms at study enrollment also demonstrated this classic pattern of premenstrual symptoms. After estradiol administration, four women had lower symptom scores, eight had higher scores, and two had the same scores. Overall, estradiol had no significant effect on symptoms (mean area under the curve 18.9 +/- 14.8 day(-1) vs 20.3 +/- 14.8 day(-1), p>0.05). Ten subjects had significant relationships between asthma symptoms and premenstrual symptoms, whereas six had significant relationships between PEFR and premenstrual symptoms.; Exogenous estradiol administration had no significant effect on premenstrual symptoms in women with PMA. The lack of a significant effect allows for patient blinding in a placebo-controlled, crossover study of exogenous estradiol in PMA that is currently under way Clinical implications of relationships between asthma symptoms versus premenstrual symptoms and pulmonary function versus premenstrual symptoms may warrant further study.",E,E

The exact mechanisms behind these symptoms are unknown, but the rate of decline in estrogen concentrations has been suggested to affect the risk of hot flushes.; The objective was to assess whether vasomotor symptoms were induced in women without previous such symptoms, when the women were given combined estradiol and progestagen therapy for 3 months, whereafter therapy was abruptly withdrawn.; After randomization, 40 postmenopausal women without previous or current vasomotor symptoms were treated transdermally with either 50 micrograms/day 17 beta-estradiol or placebo during 14 weeks. During the 13th and 14th weeks, treatment was combined with oral medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day. Serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations were analysed before and after 12 weeks of therapy. Climacteric symptoms were assessed at the same intervals as well as 8 weeks after the end of therapy.; All women had low pretreatment levels of estradiol and high FSH concentrations. During estradiol therapy estradiol levels increased significantly, whereas FSH only decreased slightly. No woman developed vasomotor symptoms after withdrawal of therapy.; Postmenopausal women without previous or current vasomotor symptoms did not develop such symptoms when estrogen replacement therapy was first instituted and then abruptly stopped. Probably other factors than the rate with which estrogen concentrations decrease determine whether or not a woman will develop vasomotor symptoms. Evidently, estrogens can be prescribed to a woman who has no vasomotor symptoms, without much risk of inducing such symptoms if she decides to abandon therapy, even after 3 months of treatment.",E,E

DHEA possibly prevents immunosenescence, and as a neuroactive steroid it may influence processes of cognition and memory. Epidemiological studies revealed an inverse correlation between DHEAS levels and the incidence of cardiovascular disease in men, but not in women. To define a suitable dose for DHEA substitution in elderly men we studied pharmacokinetics and biotransformation of orally administered DHEA in 14 healthy male volunteers (mean age, 58.8 +/- 5.1 yr; mean body mass index, 25.5 +/- 1.5 kg/m2) with serum DHEAS concentrations below 4.1 micromol/L (1500 ng/mL). Diurnal blood sampling was performed on 3 occasions in a single dose, randomized, cross-over design (oral administration of placebo, 50 mg DHEA, or 100 mg DHEA). The intake of 50 mg DHEA led to an increase in serum DHEAS to mean levels of young adult men, whereas 100 mg DHEA induced supraphysiological concentrations [placebo vs. 50 mg DHEA vs. 100 mg DHEA; area under the curve (AUC) 0-12 h (mean +/- SD) for DHEA, 108 +/- 22 vs. 252 +/- 45 vs. 349 +/- 72 nmol/L x h; AUC 0-12 h for DHEAS, 33 +/- 9 vs. 114 +/- 19 vs. 164 +/- 36 micromol/L x h]. Serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone remained unchanged after DHEA administration. In contrast, 17beta-estradiol and estrone significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner to concentrations still within the upper normal range for men [placebo vs. 50 mg DHEA vs. 100 mg DHEA; AUC 0-12 h for 17beta-estradiol, 510 +/- 198 vs. 635 +/- 156 vs. 700 +/- 209 pmol/L x h (P < 0.0001); AUC 0-12 h for estrone, 1443 +/- 269 vs. 2537 +/- 434 vs. 3254 +/- 671 pmol/L x h (P < 0.0001)]. In conclusion, 50 mg DHEA seems to be a suitable substitution dose in elderly men, as it leads to serum DHEAS concentrations usually measured in young healthy adults. The DHEA-induced increase in circulating estrogens may contribute to beneficial effects of DHEA in men.",E,E

Significant increases were seen in total-body and forearm bone density (P < 0.01). Symptoms related to HRT (breast tenderness, spotting, pelvic discomfort, and mood changes) were mild and short-lived.; Continuous low-dose HRT with conjugated equine estrogen and oral medroxyprogesterone combined with adequate calcium and vitamin D provides a bone-sparing effect that is similar or superior to that provided by other, higher-dose HRT regimens in elderly women. This combination is well tolerated by most patients.",I,I

The neurobiology of estrogen, particularly its neuromodulatory and neuroprotective actions, provide a viable basis to support such cognition-enhancing effects. We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group design pilot clinical study to evaluate the cognitive and neuroendocrine response to estrogen administration for postmenopausal women with AD. Twelve women with probably AD of mild-moderate severity completed the study. During an eight week treatment period, six women received 0.05 mg/day dosage of 17 beta-estradiol via a skin patch and the remaining six wore a placebo skin patch. Subjects were randomized to equal distribution, and evaluated at baseline, at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 8 on treatment, and at weeks 9, 10, 11, and 13 off treatment. On each day of evaluation, cognition was assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests, and blood samples were collected to measure plasma concentrations of estradiol and estrone. In addition, several neuroendocrine markers were measured in plasma to evaluate the relationship between estrogen-induced cognitive effects and fluctuations in the catecholaminergic and insulin-like growth factor systems. Significant effects of estrogen treatment were observed on attention (i.e. Stroop: number of self-corrections in the Interference condition, F[1,8] = 8.22, P < 0.03) and verbal memory (i.e., Buschke: delayed cued recall, F[3,30] = 4.31, P < 0.02). The salutary effects of estrogen on cognition were observed after the first week of treatment, and started to diminish when treatment was terminated. For women treated with estrogen, enhancement in verbal memory was positively correlated with plasma levels of estradiol (r = 0.96, P < 0.02) and negatively correlated with concentrations of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in plasma (r = -0.92, P < 0.03). Furthermore, a trend in the data was evident to suggest a negative relationship between plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and verbal memory (r = -0.86, P = 0.06). Estrogen administration suppressed peripheral markers of the IGF system, as evidenced by a negative correlation between plasma concentration of estradiol and IGF-1 (r = -0.93, P < 0.03), and a trend for a similar relationship between plasma levels of estradiol and IGFBP-3 (r = -0.86, P = 0.06). With respect to the catecholamines assayed, norepinephrine was positively correlated with verbal memory (r = 0.95, P < 0.02) for women who were treated with estrogen. Furthermore, there was a trend to suggest a negative relationship between plasma epinephrine levels and the number of errors committed on a test of attention (r = -0.84, P = 0.07). In the placebo group, no significant effects of estrogen replacement were evident either on measures of cognition or on any of the neuroendocrine markers. The results of this study suggest that estrogen replacement may enhance cognition for postmenopausal women with AD. Furthermore, several markers of neuroendocrine activity may serve to index the magnitude of estrogen-induced facilitation on cognition. In addition, research findings from the present study will provide important information for the design of larger prospective clinical studies that are essential to definitively establish the therapeutic role of estrogen replacement for postmenopausal women with AD.",E,E

Cognitive performance was tested at baseline and after 2 weeks of estradiol or placebo treatment using verbal, semantic, and spatial memory tests as well as a mental rotation task and the Stroop. Initial results showed no differences after treatment between placebo or estradiol treated subjects. However, within treatment group analysis revealed that estradiol treated subjects who reached higher estradiol levels (larger than 29 pg/ml) performed significantly better after treatment in the delayed recall of the paired associate test (verbal memory) than subjects who reached lower estradiol levels (P < 0.05). A nonsignificant trend was observed for the immediate recall condition (P < 0.10). These findings were strengthened by correlations between treatment-induced estradiol levels and changes in verbal memory performance. In addition, there was an association between estradiol levels and mood changes. However mood changes were not significantly associated with changes in verbal memory performance (P > 0.20). The present study supports the idea that estradiol replacement has specific effects on verbal memory in healthy postmenopausal women, with delayed recall being more affected. It suggests that these effects can occur relatively rapidly, and that there may be a dose response relationship of estradiol to memory enhancement. Furthermore, the fact that these results were obtained in women who had been menopausal for an average of 17 years before entering the study indicates that the brain maintains a sensitivity for estrogens even after years of low estradiol plasma concentrations.",E,E

Progestins alone do not alleviate SAS in menopausal women. However, progestins may require concomitant estrogen administration and estrogen alone may stimulate breathing during sleep. To test these hypotheses, we studied the effects of estrogen alone and estrogen combined with progestin on SAS in menopausal women, using a prospective, cross-over, inception cohort study.; In this pilot study, five women who developed SAS after menopause underwent 2 nights of polysomnography to obtain a baseline, then returned for polysomnography after 3-4 weeks of taking micronized 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and after 10-12 days of taking E2 combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (E2 + P). Sleep stages were scored according to Rechtshaffen and Kales, frequency and length of apneas were recorded for each subject each night, and the data were analyzed by Student's t test.; E2 and E2 + P both reduced the Respiratory Distress Index. E2 also raised the lowest oxygen desaturation associated with apneic episodes. Total minutes of rapid eye movement sleep increased, and the number of waking episodes decreased when the women were taking E2 and E2 + P, as previously reported.; Within 1 month after initiating E2 or E2 + P, SAS was reduced in all patients. The Respiratory Distress Index decreased by 25%, and the addition of progestin brought the SAS reduction to 50% in this pilot study. A randomized study in a large group of patients is justified by the findings of this study.

None of the liver biochemistry changes measured in these studies were of clinical significance, nor were there biochemical differences between estrogen therapy alone compared with combined esterified estrogen-methyltestosterone preparation when administered to postmenopausal women during a period of up to 24 months.; Combined esterified estrogen-methyltestosterone therapy (in doses of 0.625 mg esterified estrogen + 1.25 mg methyltestosterone or 1.25 mg esterified estrogen + 2.5 mg methyltestosterone) was found to be safe regarding hepatic function in postmenopausal women during the course of 24 months in eight controlled clinical trials.",E,E

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) results in only modest increases in bone mineral density (BMD). However, for women with low bone mass, the ideal therapy should not only inhibit bone resorption but simultaneously stimulate bone formation to increase bone mass above the fracture threshold. We thus performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study to prospectively investigate the effect of a low dose of fluoride, in combination with HRT, on BMD and biochemical markers of bone turnover. One hundred healthy postmenopausal women (60-70 yr old) were thus randomly assigned to: 1) HRT [transdermal 17beta-estradiol, releasing 50 microg/day; plus oral norethisterone acetate (NETA), 1 mg/day]; or 2) oral monofluorophosphate (MFP; equivalent to fluoride, 20 mg/day); or 3) HRT+MFP; or 4) placebo, for 96 weeks. All participants received a calcium supplement of 1000 mg/day. Sixty-eight women completed the study. We found a pronounced, linear increase in spinal BMD during treatment with HRT+MFP [11.8% (1.7% SEM)], which was significantly greater than the increase in the HRT group [4.0% (0.5% per yr); P < 0.05]. MFP produced a smaller increase [2.4% (0.6% per yr)], whereas there was no change in the placebo group [0.0% (0.5% SEM)]. Similar changes were found at the other skeletal sites (distal forearm, hip, and total body). Markers of bone formation showed a fall in the HRT group, which was significantly more pronounced than in the combined HRT+MFP group. A nonsignificant increase was found in the MFP group, whereas the placebo group showed a decrease caused by calcium treatment. The marker of bone resorption decreased significantly more in the HRT and the HRT+MFP groups than in the placebo group but tended to increase in the MFP group. In conclusion, this study shows, by use of biochemical markers of bone turnover, that bone resorption and formation may be dissociated, as a result of actions of two compounds with diverging effects on bone turnover. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of relatively low doses of the compounds suggested statistically and clinically significant increases in trabecular and probably also cortical bone. Adverse effects were relatively rare and mild.",I,I

Ovarian hormones or their metabolites have direct and indirect actions on neuronal receptors, which may affect responses to psychoactive drugs acting on the same central nervous system receptors. This study explored the effect of menstrual cycle phase on the mood-altering and performance effects of a single oral dose of the benzodiazepine triazolam. Twenty women received triazolam (0.25 mg orally) or placebo at the follicular, periovulatory, and luteal phases of their menstrual cycles in a within-subject design. Dependent measures included self-reported mood states, psychomotor performance, and plasma levels of triazolam, estradiol, progesterone, and allopregnanolone. After administration of triazolam, most subjects reported the expected increases in fatigue and decreases in arousal and psychomotor performance. Neither plasma levels nor mood and performance effects of triazolam differed across the three phases. This study illustrates a useful methodology for assessing responses to psychoactive drugs in normally cycling women and shows that the effects of this drug were highly stable across the cycle.",E,E

Sixty-six adult hypogonadal men (22-65 years of age) were withdrawn from prior i.m. treatment for 4-6 weeks and then randomly assigned to treatment with TTD (two 2.5-mg systems applied nightly) or i.m. (200 mg injected every 2 weeks); there were 33 patients per group. Twenty-six patients in the TTD group and 32 in the i.m. group completed the study. TTD treatment produced circadian variations in the levels of total T, bioavailable T, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol within the normal physiological ranges. i.m. treatment produced supraphysiological levels of T, bioavailable T, and estradiol (but not dihydrotestosterone) for several days after each injection. Mean morning sex hormone levels were within the normal range in greater proportions of TTD patients (range, 77-100%) than i.m. patients (range, 19-84%). Both treatments normalized LH levels in approximately 50% of patients with primary hypogonadism; however, LH levels were suppressed to the subnormal range in 31% of i.m. patients vs. 0% of TTD patients. Both treatments maintained sexual function (assessed by questionnaire and Rigiscan) and mood (Beck Depression Inventory) at the prior treatment levels. Prostate-specific antigen levels, prostate volumes, and lipid and serum chemistry parameters were comparable in both treatment groups. Transient skin irritation from the patches was reported by 60% of the TTD patients, but caused only three patients (9%) to discontinue treatment. i.m. treatment produced local reactions in 33% of patients and was associated with significantly more abnormal hematocrit elevations (43.8% of patients) compared with TTD treatment (15.4% of patients). Gynecomastia resolved more frequently during TTD treatment (4 of 10 patients) than with i.m. treatment (1 of 9 patients). Although both treatments seem to be efficacious for replacing T in hypogonadal men, the more physiological sex hormone levels and profiles associated with TTD may offer possible advantages over i.m. in minimizing excessive stimulation of erythropoiesis, preventing/ameliorating gynecomastia, and not over-suppressing gonadotropins.",E,E

At 2 years, the difference from placebo in percentage change from baseline of L1-4 lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) (assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) was 4.7% +/- 0.7% with estradiol 25 mg/day, 7.3% +/- 0.7% with estradiol 50 mg/day and 8.7% +/- 0.7% with estradiol 75 mg/day (all values mean +/- SEM). There were also significant increases in femoral neck, trochanter and total hip BMD with all doses of estradiol compared with placebo. Additionally, most patients had a significant gain (increase greater than 2.08%) in lumbar spine bone mass compared with placebo. Patients who received estradiol also experienced clinically significant and dose-related decreases in total serum osteocalcin, serum bone alkaline phosphatase and urinary C-telopeptide, with all three markers of bone turnover returning to premenopausal levels. Estradiol was well tolerated during the 2-year treatment period. Transdermal estradiol is effective and well tolerated at dosages between 25-75 mg/day in the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women; 25 mg/day offers an effective option for those women who cannot tolerate higher doses.",I,I

Perimenopausal women have only approximately 50% of peak DHEA levels. Despite limited scientific data, DHEA has gained recognition as a dietary supplement to reduce the symptoms of aging and improve well-being. This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of 50 mg/day of oral DHEA supplementation, for 3 months, on 60 perimenopausal women with complaints of altered mood and well-being. Changes in the serum endocrine profile of women in the DHEA group were significantly greater than the placebo group, including a 242% [95% confidence interval (CI) +60.1, +423.9] increase in DHEAS, a 94.8% (95% CI +34.2, +155.4) increase in testosterone, and a 13.2% (95% CI -27.88, +0.5) decline in cortisol compared to baseline. Women receiving DHEA had a 10.1% (95% CI -15.0, -5.1) decline in high-density lipoprotein and an 18.1% (95% CI -32.2, -3.9) decline in Lp(a) from baseline, but these declines did not significantly differ from women who received placebo. Women receiving DHEA did not have any improvements significantly greater than placebo in the severity of perimenopausal symptoms, mood, dysphoria, libido, cognition, memory, or well-being.

The goal was to assess the efficacy on climacteric symptoms and the safety of a new estradiol (CAS 50-28-2) transdermal patch with solid active matrix (SAM) in comparison to a conventional liquid reservoir (LR) type estradiol transdermal patch. Both patches released 50 micrograms/day estradiol. One group of patients received the SAM patch and the other the LR patch in 4-week cycles, with a twice-weekly application of the patches for 3 weeks, followed by one week without patches. Progestin opposition was achieved with medroxyprogesterone acetate 5 mg/day orally in the last 11 days of patch application in the German study and with 10 mg/day in the last 12 days of patch application in the Italian study. Both studies were divided into two Parts: Part 1 with three 4-week cycles for a total of 12 weeks and Part 2 for other ten 4-weeks cycles in which the patches could be applied also continuously. The total duration of the study was therefore 52 weeks.; Germany study. 133 patients resulted randomized to the SAM group and 129 to the LR group. Both estradiol patches quickly relieved climacteric symptoms already during the first 3 weeks of patch application, as shown by the rapid decrease of the Kupperman Index. At the end of Part 1, in the SAM group 91% and in the LR group 96% of patients reported relief from climacteric symptoms. At the end of Part 2 the percentages were 98% and 95%, respectively. The two patches were therapeutically equivalent with a power greater than 99.7%. Both patches were systemically fairly well tolerated. Only 4.5% of patients in the SAM group and 3.9% in the LR group discontinued prematurely for possible adverse reactions related to estradiol. There was no significant difference between the two patches with regard to systemic tolerability. Conversely, with regard to local skin reactions, the SAM patch was significantly (p < 0.01) better tolerated than the LR patch. The adhesion to the skin of the SAM patches was better than that of the LR patches. RESULTS. Italian study. 139 patients resulted randomized to the SAM patch and 128 to the LR patch. Also in this study both types of patches relieved the climacteric symptoms already during the first 3 weeks of patch application, as shown by the rapid decrease of the visual analogue scale (VAS) recordings of severity of hot flushes and of sweats. At the end of Part 1 both patches relieved 95% of patients from climacteric symptoms. At the end of Part 2, i.e. after 52 weeks, 100% of patients were relieved from climacteric symptoms. Of these, 72% in the SAM group and 78% in the LR group reported complete disappearance of symptoms. Also in the Italian study, therefore, the two patches were found therapeutically equivalent. Both patches stopped or even reversed bone mineral loss in L2-L4 and had some favorable effects on lipid metabolism. Both patches were systemically equally fairly well tolerated with premature discontinuations for systemic adverse drug reactions in only 5.0% of patients in the SAM group and 3.9% in the LR group. Conversely, as in the German study, the SAM patches were significantly better tolerated by the skin (p < 0.0001).; The two types of estradiol transdermal patches were equivalent in providing an effective and rapid relief from climacteric symptoms. Systemically both patches were fairly well tolerated. The SAM patches were significantly better tolerated by the skin. The better local tolerability combined with better adhesion and cosmetic properties render the SAM patches very patient friendly and improve the compliance in the long term estrogen replacement therapy required to reduce osteoporosis and cardiovascular risks.",E,E

The aged subjects received estradiol or placebo treatment for 14 days. All subjects were then exposed to the 'Trier Social Stress Test' (TSST) and the dexamethasone (Dex)-human corticotropin-releasing hormone (hCRH) test (100 microgram hCRH after premedication with 1.5 mg Dex). Psychological parameters including perceived stressfulness, mood and subjective well-being were measured by visual analog scales, a mood questionnaire and a mood diary, respectively. Results show that the TSST induced significant increases in adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), free salivary cortisol, total plasma cortisol and heart rates (all p < 0.0001). Regardless of age, comparable hormonal response patterns were observed in the TSST as indicated by similar peak levels and recovery phases. Visual analog scales confirmed that the same amount of stress was experienced by young and elderly subjects. In both age groups, hCRH injection after Dex premedication provoked significant increases in ACTH, free salivary cortisol and total plasma cortisol (all p < 0.0001). In contrast to the psychosocial stressor, elderly women were found to respond with a markedly enhanced cortisol response compared to young controls in the Dex-CRH test (p < 0.025). Additional investigation of morning cortisol profiles could not reveal any age-related differences in basal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Following estradiol treatment, estradiol levels significantly increased only in substituted postmenopausal women (p < 0.001) reaching concentrations typically found in younger women during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Corticosteroid-binding globulin levels did not differ significantly between groups. When confronted with the TSST, no response differences emerged between the three groups. However, estradiol treatment appeared to blunt the total plasma cortisol response in the Dex-CRH test, resulting in smaller increases in untreated premenopausal women and estradiol-treated postmenopausal women compared to placebo-treated postmenopausal women (p < 0.02). In sum, no response differences were observed after confrontation with a psychosocial stress test in our sample of healthy elderly subjects. As shown with the Dex-CRH test, our data suggest that the negative feedback of the HPA axis in elderly women is altered. Moreover, the current data suggest that estradiol replacement may modulate HPA feedback sensitivity in humans.",E,E

A calcium supplement of 600 mg nocte was given to only those women who had a daily calcium intake of less than 1 g per day at baseline, as assessed by recalled dietary intake.

Although 72% of the patients had been supplemented with calcium between the first and second studies, separate analyses revealed that the change in calcium intake had not affected the result. Further breakdown of the groups into baseline 'normal' absorbers (alpha >/=0.55) and 'malabsorbers' (alpha <0.55) revealed that alpha decreased with HRT treatment only in the normal absorbers, and remained stable in the malabsorbers. Conversely, following HRT plus calcitriol treatment, alpha increased only in the malabsorbers, the normal absorbers in this group remaining unchanged. In conclusion, our data show that HRT, of the type and dose used in this study, did not produce an increase in absorption efficiency; it was in fact associated with a fall. Increased absorption efficiency cannot be achieved unless calcitriol is used concurrently, and then only in patients with malabsorption. Calcitriol also had a significant effect in normal absorbers in that it prevented the decline in alpha seen with HRT alone, and thus should be considered in all patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with HRT.",E,E

In the most difficult test, both groups improved their postural balance significantly (from 13 to 32 and from 22 to 39, respectively) after 4 weeks. Thereafter, no change was seen. One problem was low statistical power, but the relative change in balance did not differ between groups. The comparison did not show even a minute advantage of E2 over placebo, so a study with higher power would probably not have shown a more pronounced effect of estrogen than placebo. The change over time did not differ between groups, which indicates a significant learning effect.; In women without vasomotor symptoms, estrogen therapy did not seem to increase postural balance significantly more than placebo.

Treatments were administered, using a double-blind, double-dummy technique for 6 cycles of 28 days.; Three hundred and seventeen women, 158 in the E2-DSG and 159 in the E2V-MPA group, completed six treatment cycles. Both treatments reduced menopausal symptoms rapidly and to a similar extent. Hot flushes were present in 88% of the women in both groups. After six treatment cycles, hot flushes were no longer present in 71 and 62% of the women in the E2-DSG and E2V-MPA group, respectively. Perspiration decreased from 80 to 65% in the E2-DSG group and from 82 to 63% in the E2V-MPA group. Mood disturbances were present in 82% of the women in the E2-DSG at baseline, and in 52% after six cycles. In the E2V-MPA group the corresponding figures were 68 and 42%, respectively. The bleeding pattern was comparable in both treatment groups. Regular withdrawal (expected) bleeding appeared in 90-92% and in 85-90% of the women in cycles 1-5 with E2-DSG and E2V-MPA, respectively. Irregular bleeding (including spotting) occurred in 15.2% of the women receiving E2-DSG and in 20.1% of the women treated with E2V-MPA in cycle 6. In both treatment groups there was a tendency of a slight decrease in blood pressure. Adverse events were in less than 10% in each group the reason to discontinue treatment.; Both treatments effectively alleviated menopausal complaints and presented good cycle control.

The changes in Kupperman Index (primary efficacy variable), hot flushes and urogenital symptom score were studied from baseline to the end of the study. In addition, skin tolerability was assessed and patients were also asked to grade the subjective acceptance of therapy.; A reduction in Kupperman Index was observed in both groups, and at each cycle of the placebo-controlled treatment phase the 7-day-Estradiol patch was superior compared with placebo (last value vs. baseline P = 0.0006). From the second treatment week onwards a distinct difference was noted in the reduction of hot flushes from baseline between the 7-day-Estradiol patch group and the placebo group. The difference between the groups was statistically significant for each cycle and at the end of the controlled treatment phase (mean weekly hot flush reduction at the end of the placebo-controlled treatment phase: -32.5 for the 7-day-Estradiol patch vs. -22.0 for placebo, P = 0.0025). The efficacy of the 7-day-Estradiol patch within the application period did not show any difference between days 1-3 and 4-7. Subjective acceptance of the 7-day-Estradiol patch was good and 72.4% of patients who took active medication throughout the study were willing to consider continuing its use.; The 7-day-Estradiol patch is well tolerated and provides effective relief of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms in hysterectomized women, with a rapid onset of action and 7-day duration of therapeutic effect.

This increase was higher in the A treatment group (4.08% P < 0.01). Sexuality improved significantly with therapy; however, tibolone and androgens increased scores to a greater extent than ERT. Androgen therapy was associated with significant increases in total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides. Cholesterol and LDL fall into groups E and T, HDL into groups A and T and triglycerides in group T only.; The combined regimen of androgens and ERT increased vertebral bone mass and enhance sexual activity in postmenopausal women equal to that of tibolone and to a greater extent than ERT alone; its effects on lipids, however, are clearly adverse.",E,E

One hypothesis is that testosterone enhances spatial abilities, while it might impair verbal skills.; Thirty elderly men received a single testosterone (250 mg testosterone enanthate) or placebo injection. Cognitive performance was tested before and 5 days after treatment using spatial as well as verbal tests.; Five days after injection, testosterone and estradiol levels were still in the supraphysiologic range. In the verbal fluency task, the placebo group, but not the testosterone group, showed a practice effect. Therefore, the testosterone group performed significantly worse than the placebo group after treatment. No effects of testosterone were observed in the other verbal and spatial tasks.; The present finding, that testosterone blocks the practice effect in verbal fluency, partly supports the general idea that sex steroids modulate performance in tests with known gender differences. Moreover it demonstrates that these effects can occur rapidly. However, beneficial effects on spatial cognition or memory might need more time to develop and/or might only occur when a less pronounced testosterone increase is induced.",E,E

The commercial availability of DHEA outside the regular pharmaceutical-medical network in the United States creates a real public health problem that may be resolved only by appropriate long-term clinical trials in elderly men and women. Two hundred and eighty healthy individuals (women and men 60-79 years old) were given DHEA, 50 mg, or placebo, orally, daily for a year in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. No potentially harmful accumulation of DHEAS and active steroids was recorded. Besides the reestablishment of a ""young"" concentration of DHEAS, a small increase of testosterone and estradiol was noted, particularly in women, and may be involved in the significantly demonstrated physiological-clinical manifestations here reported. Bone turnover improved selectively in women >70 years old, as assessed by the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) technique and the decrease of osteoclastic activity. A significant increase in most libido parameters was also found in these older women. Improvement of the skin status was observed, particularly in women, in terms of hydration, epidermal thickness, sebum production, and pigmentation. A number of biological indices confirmed the lack of harmful consequences of this 50 mg/day DHEA administration over one year, also indicating that this kind of replacement therapy normalized some effects of aging, but does not create ""supermen/women"" (doping).",E,E

Validated questionnaires [Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) index, Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ)] and Visual Analogue (VA) scales were used to assess the effects of the extract on QoL at baseline and after 16 weeks' treatment with either the ginseng extract or placebo. To assess the efficacy of ginseng on postmenopausal symptoms, physiological parameters [follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels, endometrial thickness, maturity index and vaginal pH] were recorded at the same time points. Of the 384 randomized patients (mean age 53.5 +/- 4.0 years), the questionnaires were completed by 193 women treated with ginseng and 191 treated with placebo. With regard to the primary endpoint (total score of the PGWB index) the extract showed only a tendency for a slightly better overall symptomatic relief (p < 0.1). Exploratory analysis of PGWB subsets, however, reported p-values < 0.05 for depression, well-being and health subscales in favor of ginseng compared with placebo. No statistically significant effects were seen for the WHQ and the VA scales or the physiological parameters, including vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes). The positive effects of ginseng on health-related QoL in menopausal women should be further investigated. This study shows, however, that the beneficial effects of ginseng are most likely not mediated by hormone replacement-like effects, as physiological parameters such as FSH and estradiol levels, endometrial thickness, maturity index and vaginal pH were not affected by the treatment.",E,E

Subjects were tested four times, during the early follicular and midluteal menstrual phases, after 4 wk of combined estradiol-norethindrone (progestin) oral contraceptive administration (OC E+P), and after 4 wk of progestin-only oral contraceptive administration (OC P). The order of the OC P and OC E+P were randomized.

Progestin administration raised the T(es) threshold for sweating during OC P, but this effect was not present when estrogen was administered with progestin, suggesting that estrogen modifies progestin-related changes in temperature regulation. These data are also consistent with previous findings that estrogen lowers the thermoregulatory operating point.",E,E

Memory, frontal lobe functions (inhibition and planning) and visuospatial abilities (mental rotation) were tested before and after treatment. Estrogen plasma levels were measured to confirm the result of EHR. Cortisol plasma levels were also measured before and after cognitive performance in order to evaluate the effects of EHR on the sensitivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to mild mental stress.; Plasma estradiol levels in the drug group increased to levels equivalent to that of a fertile woman (0.21+/-0.5 nmol/l). Memory function as well as visuospatial abilities as measured by a mental rotation task improved significantly with EHR. However, there was no effect of EHR on frontal lobe functions. The cognitive effects were not dependent on an improvement in mood or general well-being as may be the case with EHR in women at peri- or post-menopausal stage. EHR was found to increase the HPA response to task-induced stress, as indicated by an increase in cortisol plasma levels.; The present study has provided evidence of a beneficial effect of EHR on cognitive abilities given for first time to healthy elderly women. Furthermore, the present study has demonstrated a differential effect of EHR on memory, visuospatial abilities and frontal lobe function.",E,E

Efficacy was evaluated by relief of vaginal symptoms and concentrations of serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone. Safety was monitored by the incidence of adverse events, evaluation of endometrial biopsies, and clinical laboratory results. Patients also assessed the acceptability of the study medications.; Composite scores of vaginal symptoms (dryness, soreness, and irritation) demonstrated that both treatments provided equivalent relief of the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis. At weeks 2, 12, and 24, increases in serum estradiol concentrations and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone were observed in significantly more patients who were using the vaginal cream than in those who were using the vaginal tablets (p < 0.001). Fewer patients who were using the vaginal tablets experienced endometrial proliferation or hyperplasia compared with patients who were using the vaginal cream. Significantly more patients who were using the vaginal tablets rated their medication favorably than did patients who were using the vaginal cream (p < or = 0.001).

However, the occurrence of women with no bone response to HRT has not been widely examined. We identified the densitometric nonresponders to long-term HRT and investigated some characteristics and biochemical variables as possible predictors of densitometric nonresponse in postmenopausal women. The study population was a subsample of the Kuopio Osteoporosis Study (n = 14,220). A total of 464 early postmenopausal women were randomized into four treatment groups: (1) HRT (sequential combination of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 1 mg cyproterone acetate); (2) vitamin D3; (3) HRT + Vitamin D3 combined; and (4) placebo. In this study, the data from HRT and placebo groups were analyzed. Lumbar (L2-4) and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and after 5 years of treatment. A densitometric nonresponder was defined as a woman whose 5-year BMD change was similar to the mean BMD change (+95% CI) of the placebo group or worse. Altogether, 74 women in the HRT group and 104 women in the placebo group complied with the treatment. According to spinal BMD analysis, 11% of the women were classified as densitometric nonresponders; the corresponding proportion for femoral BMD analysis was 26%. Both smoking (p = 0.003) and low body weight (p = 0.028) were significant risk factors for densitometric nonresponse to HRT. After 6 months of treatment the densitometric nonresponders (hip) had a significantly higher mean serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level (p = 0.038) and lower increases in serum estradiol levels (p = 0.006) than the densitometric responders. The mean changes in serum FSH and alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly lower among the densitometric nonresponders (spine) than responders (p = 0.043 and 0.017, respectively). In conclusion, this prospective study shows that especially current smokers and women with low body weight are at increased risk of poor bone response to HRT. Repeated serum FSH, estradiol and alkaline phosphatase measurements during the first months of long-term HRT may be helpful in identifying the women with no bone response to HRT.",E,E

Outcome measures were daily symptom self-ratings and standardized subjective and objective cross-sectional mood rating scales.; Five of the eight women with a history of postpartum depression (62.5%) and none of the eight women in the comparison group developed significant mood symptoms during the withdrawal period. Analysis of variance with repeated measures of daily and cross-sectional ratings of mood showed significant phase-by-group effects. These effects reflected significant increases in depressive symptoms in women with a history of postpartum depression but not in the comparison group after hormone withdrawal (and during the end of the hormone replacement phase), compared with baseline.; The data provide direct evidence in support of the involvement of the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone in the development of postpartum depression in a subgroup of women. Further, they suggest that women with a history of postpartum depression are differentially sensitive to mood-destabilizing effects of gonadal steroids.",E,E

Despite published data about higher levels of DNA adduct creations due to CPA an international multicentre study analysing 2,506 patients with 7,971 patient-years that used CPA could not find any liver cell cancers, even if due to epidemiological data 6 liver cell cancers should have occurred upon this study group. The present study deals with the evaluation of 57 women which received CPA in combination with EE2 11-13 years before. The daily dosage was 2 mg CPA in combination with 35 mg or 50 mg EE2. In Germany these drugs were registered under the name of Diane 35 or Diane 50. Long-term follow-up evaluation concerning side effects, especially the appearance of liver cell carcinomas, were the aim of this study. With the records of 32% (18/57) of the above mentioned patient group the following long-term follow-up side effects could be observed: 1) weight gain, 2) headache, 3) migraine, 4) gastrointestinal disorders, 5) mood affections/depressions, 6) oedema of the legs, 7) skin affections, 8) mastodynia. No benign liver tumor or liver cell carcinoma was detected upon our group of investigated patients. In conclusion we can affirm that the use of CPA in a dosage of 2 mg per day does not lead to serious side effects under long-term follow-up observation conditions and that it's use does not correlate with a higher appearance of liver cell carcinomas.",E,E

Vaginal progesterone (200 mg three times daily) was begun the day before oocyte retrieval and continued for a minimum of 16-19 days following human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) administration. Occurrence of bleeding following HCG injection, pregnancy rate and outcomes, and serum concentrations of oestradiol were measured. Women undergoing IVF and embryo transfer with ICSI and using vaginal progesterone for luteal support had normal luteal phase lengths (day of HCG minus day of onset of bleeding). In the absence of pregnancy, bleeding occurred after 19.2 +/- 3.9 days (mean +/- SD). Out of the pregnant group only three women bled within 19 days of HCG administration: two had biochemical pregnancies which spontaneously vanished and one evolved to term. The results reflect the normal bleeding pattern to be expected when vaginal progesterone is used for luteal support in IVF and embryo transfer, an approach whose efficacy has been amply proven. No shortened luteal phases were observed using vaginally administered progesterone.",E,E

For example, estrogen replacement improves verbal memory in women, and animal studies have shown effects of estrogen on hippocampal synaptogenesis and function. Little is known about sex steroid effects on other aspects of memory, such as frontal lobe-mediated working memory. We examined the relationships between working memory and sex steroid concentrations and whether sex steroid supplementation would modify age-related loss of working memory in older men and women. Before hormone supplementation, working memory, tested with the Subject Ordered Pointing Test (SOP), was worse in older subjects than younger subjects, and there was no evidence of gender differences at either age. Testosterone supplementation improved working memory in older men, but a similar enhancement of working memory was not found in older women supplemented with estrogen. In men, testosterone and estrogen effects were reciprocal - with better working memory related to a higher testosterone to estrogen ratio. These results suggest that sex steroids can modulate working memory in men and can act as modulators of cognition throughout life.",E,E

The study was double blind with respect to treatment (active vs placebo) but not to the dose levels of active treatment (because of the differing sizes and shapes of the patches). In addition to receiving the assigned treatment, the 100 nonhysterectomized women received 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate daily throughout the study.; The evaluable group (n = 259) had a mean age of 52 years and a mean duration of menopause of 32 months. Following 2 years of treatment, there were significant differences in favor of estradiol between all doses of the estradiol matrix transdermal system and placebo in terms of the percentage change from baseline in the bone mineral density (BMD) of the L1-L4 anteroposterior lumbar spine (0.1 and 0.05 mg/d, P < 0.001; 0.0375 mg/d, P = 0.024; 0.025 mg/d, P = 0.002). Percentage changes from baseline in the BMD of the femoral neck after 2 years of treatment also consistently demonstrated the efficacy of the estradiol matrix transdermal system compared with placebo (all, P < or = 0.044). The estradiol matrix transdermal system was well tolerated.; The estradiol matrix transdermal system was effective in preventing postmenopausal bone loss at dosages of 0.025 to 0.1 mg/d, and had a safety profile consistent with the known effects of estrogen/progestin.",I,I

The Women's Health Questionnaire, a validated quality-of-life instrument for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, was administered at baseline and 3-month intervals.; Overall, quality of life from baseline to end point was preserved equally in all treatment groups. Six domains (depressed mood, somatic symptoms, memory/concentration, sexual behavior, sleep problems, and perceived attractiveness) were unchanged in all groups. Three domains (menstrual symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and anxiety/fears) were statistically significantly different among groups. Mean scores for menstrual symptoms significantly worsened and vasomotor symptoms significantly improved from baseline to end point in the estrogen group. Mean scores for vasomotor symptoms did not worsen at any point in the raloxifene 60 mg/day group. Mean anxiety/fears scores improved significantly during raloxifene 60 mg/day administration throughout treatment (P <.05), irrespective of previous hormone replacement therapy, baseline estradiol (E2) levels, or years postmenopause.; Most quality-of-life domains were not affected by treatment with estrogen or raloxifene.

Approximately one third had low serum free testosterone concentrations at base line; the rest had normal concentrations. Men with other secondary causes of osteoporosis were excluded. All the men received calcium and vitamin D supplements. The main outcome measures were the percent changes in lumbar-spine, hip, and total-body bone mineral density.; The men who received alendronate had a mean (+/-SE) increase in bone mineral density of 7.1+/-0.3 percent at the lumbar spine, 2.5+/-0.4 percent at the femoral neck, and 2.0+/-0.2 percent for the total body (P<0.001 for all comparisons with base line). In contrast, men who received placebo had an increase in lumbar-spine bone mineral density of 1.8+/-0.5 percent (P<0.001 for the comparison with base line) and no significant changes in femoral-neck or total-body bone mineral density. The increase in bone mineral density in the alendronate group was greater than that in the placebo group at all measurement sites (P<0.001). The incidence of vertebral fractures was lower in the alendronate group than in the placebo group (0.8 percent vs. 7.1 percent, P=0.02). Men in the placebo group had a 2.4-mm decrease in height, as compared with a decrease of 0.6 mm in the alendronate group (P=0.02).

After this second ECG, premenopausal women were randomly divided into two groups. The women of Group A (n=14) received transdermal ethinyl estradiol (EE). The women of Group B (n=12) did not receive any therapy. A third ECG was performed in both groups 30-35 days after randomization.; Bilateral oophorectomy did not induce any significant modifications in the ECG parameters of the postmenopausal women whereas in the premenopausal women, we observed a significant increment in mean duration of the T wave, a significant decrease in its amplitude and significant reduction in ST depression in V2, V3, V4 and V5. The third ECG showed regression of the ECG modifications in Group A. In the women of Group B, the second and third ECGs were not substantially different, but there were statistically significant differences between the first and third ECGs.; The results of the present study show that ovariectomy induces significant though not clinically evident modifications in resting ECG. These ECG changes are probably due to the sudden reduction in sex hormone plasma levels after ovariectomy. Administration of estradiol induced regression of the ECG modifications.",E,E

Study 2 participants also recorded the number of mild, moderate, or severe hot flashes they experienced. In Study 1, a total of 219 postmenopausal women reporting vasomotor symptoms were placed randomly into groups to receive either a placebo or 1 of 4 treatments (0.2 mg/1 microg; 0.5 mg/2.5 microg; 1 mg/5 microg; or 1 mg/10 microg norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol). In Study 2, a total of 266 highly symptomatic postmenopausal women were placed randomly to receive either a placebo or 1 of 3 treatment groups [0.5 mg/2.5 microg; 1 mg/5 microg; or 1 mg/10 microg norethindrone acetate (NA)/ethinyl estradiol (EE)]. Total duration of treatment was 16 weeks in Study 1 and 12 weeks in Study 2. Study 1 subjects had to have at least 10 hot flashes during the week before randomization. Study 2 subjects had to have at least 56 moderate to severe hot flashes during the week before randomization.; In both studies, there was a dose-related decrease in hot flash frequency with the highest dose (1 mg NA/10 microg EE) group that had the greatest response. Significant differences from placebo (p < 0.05, Dunnett's test) occurred within 4 weeks in Study 1 for hot flash frequency with a percent reduction in frequency ranging from 33% for placebo to 84% for both the 1 mg NA/10 microg EE and 1 mg NA/5 microg EE dose groups. Likewise, Study 2 significant reductions in hot flash frequency occurred by Week 2 for 1 mg NA/10 microg EE, Week 3 for 1 mg NA/5 microg EE, and Week 5 for 0.5 mg NA/2.5 microg EE (p < 0.05, Dunnett's test). This dose effect was also apparent with regard to severity. In addition, more subjects had clinically meaningful reductions in hot flash frequency or elimination as the dose combinations increased.; There were significant reductions in hot flash frequency and severity with continuous treatment with norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol combinations. The time at which significant reductions were observed, as well as the magnitude of the response, were dose dependent.

A one-year study (13 cycles of 28 days), including a reference regimen of transdermal E2 and sequential oral progestogen, was followed by a continuation study for a further year in 367 women.; All regimens were highly and equally effective in the prevention of hot flushes. The fully transdermal regimens were associated with beneficial changes in the lipid profile. The sequential regimens provided effective scheduling of bleeding around the end of the progestogen phase. The continuous regimens were associated with irregular bleeding, which was rarely severe, and a gradually increasing incidence of amenorrhoea. With sequential or continuous therapy, bleeding was less severe at the lower dose of progestogen than at the higher dose. No endometrial hyperplasia was detected by biopsy in any treatment group. One serous endometrial carcinoma and one endometrial adenocarcinoma were detected. An endometrial thickness >5 mm did not predict the presence of hyperplasia at biopsy. Hormone-related adverse events were typical of those expected for HRT and dermal tolerability of the patches was good.; Fully transdermal sequential or continuous HRT is effective and well tolerated in postmenopausal women. The lower dose of NETA may be preferable, because it confers adequate endometrial protection at a lower dose of progestogen.",E,E

Estrogen/androgen (E/A) therapy is especially important for surgically menopausal women. This population group experiences marked bone loss in response to the dramatic decline in ovarian hormones. The resulting hormonal profile differs significantly from that of naturally menopausal women. For surgically menopausal women, the relation of estrogens, androgens and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) is of special concern, as the interrelation between these hormones ultimately may reduce hormonal bioavailability. This paper reviews the relation of bone metabolism to ovarian hormones and the mechanics of BMD loss as well as the tools available to clinicians to assess bone loss in menopausal women. It further discusses androgen excess in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Currently available hormonal regimens to preserve bone are described, including estrogen-only therapy, E/A therapy, tibolone and estrogen-progestogen therapy.",E,E

The symptoms are characteristic of a heat-dissipation response and consist of sweating on the face, neck, and chest, as well as peripheral vasodilation. Although hot flashes clearly accompany the estrogen withdrawal at menopause, estrogen alone is not responsible since levels do not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Until recently it was thought that hot flashes were triggered by a sudden, downward resetting of the hypothalamic setpoint, since there was no evidence of increased core body temperature. Evidence obtained using a rapidly responding ingested telemetry pill indicates that the thermoneutral zone, within which sweating, peripheral vasodilation, and shivering do not occur, is virtually nonexistent in symptomatic women but normal (about 0.4 degrees C) in asymptomatic women. The results suggest that small temperature elevations preceding hot flashes acting within a reduced thermoneutral zone constitute the triggering mechanism. Central sympathetic activation is also elevated in symptomatic women which, in animal studies, reduces the thermoneutral zone. Clonidine reduces central sympathetic activation, widens the thermoneutral zone, and ameliorates hot flashes. Estrogen virtually eliminates hot flashes but its mechanism of action is not known.",E,E

Compared to E2 treatment alone, addition of MPA increased the postpregnanolone effect on saccade deceleration, whereas the SEV response to pregnanolone was increased during E2 + NETA treatment. It is concluded that pregnanolone sensitivity increases together with deterioration in mood symptoms during addition of progestagen to HRT.",E,E

To address this we compared the effect of 1 mg estradiol-17 beta with a 2 mg dose, in combination with cyclical dydrogesterone, in the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss. We conducted a multicenter double-masked prospective randomized, placebo-controlled study in 595 apparently healthy postmenopausal women randomized to either placebo, or continuous oral estradiol-17 beta 1 mg or 2 mg with sequential dydrogesterone for 2 years. The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) of actively treated groups compared with placebo. Women taking either 1 mg or 2 mg estradiol-17 beta showed a significant increase in BMD of the LS (mean +/- SD, 5.2 +/- 3.8% and 6.7 +/- 4.0% respectively, both p < 0.001) whilst BMD in the placebo group decreased (-1.9 +/- 4.0%). Increases were also observed in FN BMD in both treated groups (2.7 +/- 4.2% and 2.5 +/- 5.2% respectively, both p < 0.001) in contrast to the placebo group (-1.8 +/- 4.8%). The oldest women showed the greatest treatment response. One milligram estradiol-17 beta in combination with dydrogesterone is effective in conserving LS and proximal femur bone mass, both of which are clinically important sites of osteoporotic fracture, and is as effective as 2 mg in preventing FN bone. The lower dose of estradiol-17 beta is a particularly suitable treatment for osteoporosis management in older women since it should minimize side-effects and improve the acceptability of HRT.",I,I

Among the treatments currently popular are extracts of wild yam (Dioscorea villosa), which are applied topically in the form of a cream. These preparations are known to contain steroidal saponins, including diosgenin, which has been claimed to influence endogenous steroidogenesis. However, there have been no studies of the safety or efficacy of these preparations in the management of menopausal symptoms.; We therefore conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of the effects of a wild yam cream in 23 healthy women suffering from troublesome symptoms of the menopause. After a 4-week baseline period, each woman was given active cream and matching placebo for 3 months in random order. Diaries were completed over the baseline period and for 1 week each month thereafter, and blood and saliva samples were collected at baseline and at 3 and 6 months, for measurement of lipids and hormones.; The average age of the subjects was 53.3 +/- 1.1 (SEM) years and average time since last period 4.3 +/- 0.9 years. At baseline, the average body mass index was 27.3 +/- 0.8, cholesterol level 5.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/l and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 74.2 +/- 5.1 IU/l; estradiol levels were undetectable in the majority of cases. After 3 months of treatment, no significant side-effects were reported with either active treatment or placebo, and there were no changes in weight, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or levels of total serum cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, FSH, glucose, estradiol, or serum or salivary progesterone. Symptom scores showed a minor effect of both placebo and active treatment on diurnal flushing number and severity and total non-flushing symptom scores, and on nocturnal sweating after placebo, but no statistical difference between placebo and active creams.; This study suggests that short-term treatment with topical wild yam extract in women suffering from menopausal symptoms is free of side-effects, but appears to have little effect on menopausal symptoms. It emphasizes the importance of careful study of treatments for menopausal symptoms if women are to be adequately informed about the choices available to them.",E,E

Participants received weekly intramuscular injections of either 100 mg testosterone enanthate or placebo (saline) for 6 weeks. Cognitive evaluations were conducted at baseline, week 3, and week 6 of treatment by use of a battery of neuropsychologic tests.; Circulating total testosterone was raised an average of 130% from baseline at week 3 and 116% at week 6 in the treatment group. Because of aromatization of testosterone, estradiol increased an average of 77% at week 3 and 73% at week 6 in the treatment group. Significant improvements in cognition were observed for spatial memory (recall of a walking route), spatial ability (block construction), and verbal memory (recall of a short story) in older men treated with testosterone compared with baseline and the placebo group, although improvements were not evident for all measures.; The results suggest that short-term testosterone administration enhances cognitive function in healthy older men. However, it remains unclear whether these improvements in cognition are attributable to increased testosterone or estradiol levels, or both. The potential role of testosterone vs its metabolites on cognition requires further research.",E,E

Although syndrome X does not result in an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, the symptoms are often troublesome and unresponsive to conventional antianginal therapy. The majority of patients are postmenopausal, and estrogen therapy can alleviate anginal symptoms. We investigated the effect of esterified estrogens combined with methyltestosterone (Estratest) on quality of life in postmenopausal women with syndrome X.; Patients were withdrawn from antianginal therapy. Sublingual nitrates were allowed for treatment of anginal episodes. Patients underwent treadmill testing, and quality of life was assessed by using the Short Form-36 and Cardiac Health Profile questionnaires after the women had received 8 weeks of Estratest or identical placebo in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study.; Nineteen patients were randomized, and 16 patients completed the protocol. Plasma 17beta-estradiol concentrations were significantly increased by Estratest; however, total testosterone levels were not. The ""emotional"" score of the Cardiac Health Profile questionnaire was significantly improved after Estratest use compared with placebo (p = 0.03); however, there was no significant change in the Short Form-36 questionnaire for any variable. Estratest significantly increased systolic blood pressure and rate pressure product at rest but had no effect on exercise parameters. Time to onset of chest pain during exercise was also unaffected.; We have demonstrated a beneficial effect of Estratest on emotional well-being in postmenopausal women with cardiological syndrome X.

One hundred and seventy-one of them were given continuous solid matrix patch TTS 50 mg/day for 6 months. Sexual behaviour, menopausal symptoms and well-being were evaluated through a self-rating method. We used a structured questionnaire with three obligatory answers (less/same/more) for each question--sexual life, hot flushes, touchiness, insomnia, blood pressure, work willing, memory loss, well-being--filled in by the women themselves or by the medical equipe after a telephone interview.; Seventy five per cent of women aged 51-53 and 84% aged 54-56, who had been treated for 6 months with TTS showed a fall of sexual drive, if compared with, respectively, 62% and 48% of untreated subjects. Relief of hot flushes, touchiness and insomnia occurred in 80% of treated women, with slight differences among the various groups while 61% showed increase of well-being.; The results of our study demonstrate that continuous TTS for 6 months decreased sexual drive in 69% of women, improved menopausal symptoms in 80% women but increased well-being only in 61% of women.

In women, a clear deterioration is observed from early menopause. The effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in preserving muscle performance is, however, unclear. This trial examined the effects of a 12-month HRT and high-impact physical exercise regimen on skeletal muscle in women in early menopause. A total of 80 women aged 50-57 years were assigned randomly to one of four groups: exercise (Ex), HRT, exercise+HRT (ExHRT) and control (Co). The exercise groups participated in a high-impact training programme. The administration of HRT (oestradiol/noretisterone acetate) or placebo was carried out double-blind. Knee extension torque and vertical jumping height were evaluated. Lean tissue cross-sectional area (LCSA) and the relative proportion of fat within the muscle compartment were measured for the quadriceps and lower leg muscles. The ExHRT group showed significant increases in knee extension torque (8.3%) and vertical jumping height (17.2%) when compared with the Co group (-7.2%). Vertical jumping height also increased after HRT alone (6.8%). The LCSA of the quadriceps was increased significantly in the HRT (6.3%) and ExHRT (7.1%) groups when compared with the Ex (2.2%) and Co (0.7%) groups. Lower leg LCSA was also increased in the ExHRT group (9.1%) when compared with the Ex (3.0%) and Co (4.1%) groups. In addition, the increase in the relative proportion of fat in the quadriceps in the Co group (16.6%) was significant compared with those in the HRT (4.9%) and ExHRT (-0.6%) groups. Thus, in post-menopausal women, muscle performance, muscle mass and muscle composition are improved by HRT. The beneficial effects of HRT combined with high-impact physical training may exceed those of HRT alone.",E,E

In addition, women treated with estrogen demonstrated improved performance on a test of semantic memory (Boston Naming Test) compared with subjects who received a placebo. Estrogen appeared to have a suppressive effect on the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system such that plasma concentration of IGF binding protein-3 was significantly reduced and plasma levels of estradiol and IGF-I were negatively correlated during estrogen treatment.; Administration of a higher dose of estrogen may enhance attention and memory for postmenopausal women with AD.

Despite biochemical evidence of partial androgen deficiency in older men, controlled studies using T demonstrate equivocal benefits. Furthermore, the importance of aromatization and 5alpha reduction in androgen actions among older men remains unclear. Dihydrotestosterone is the highest potency natural androgen with the additional features that it is neither aromatizable nor susceptible to potency amplification by 5alpha reduction. Therefore, the effects of dihydrotestosterone may differ from those of T in older men. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3 months treatment with transdermal dihydrotestosterone gel on muscle strength, mobility, and quality of life in ambulant, community-dwelling men aged 60 yr or older. Eligible men (plasma T < or =15 nmol/liter) were randomized to undergo daily dermal application of 70 mg dihydrotestosterone gel (n = 18) or vehicle (n = 19) and were studied before, monthly during, and 1 month after treatment. Among 33 (17 dihydrotestosterone, 16 placebo) men completing the study with a high degree of compliance, dihydrotestosterone had significant effects on circulating hormones (increased dihydrotestosterone; decreased total and free testosterone, LH, and FSH; unchanged SHBG and estradiol), lipid profiles (decreased total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols; unchanged high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides), hematopoiesis (increased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red cell counts), and body composition (decreased skinfold thickness and fat mass; unchanged lean mass and waist to hip ratio). Muscle strength measured by isokinetic peak torque was increased in flexion of the dominant knee but not in knee extension or shoulder contraction, nor was there any significant change in gait, balance, or mobility tests, in cognitive function, or in quality of life scales. Dihydrotestosterone treatment had no adverse effects on prostate (unchanged prostate volumes and prostate-specific antigen) and cardiovascular (no adverse change in vascular reactivity or lipids) safety markers. We conclude that 3 months treatment with transdermal dihydrotestosterone gel demonstrates expected androgenic effects, short-term safety, and limited improvement in lower limb muscle strength but no change in physical functioning or cognitive function.",E,E

Patients were randomized to receive every month during 18 months percutaneous 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)) 1.5 mg/day from Day 1 to 24 of treatment cycle, combined from Day 11 to 24 to either CA 10 mg/day (n=167) or P 200 mg/day (n=169). Endometrial biopsy (EB, main analysis criterion) was performed at baseline, and at Day 18-24 of the 6th and 18th cycles.; At Month 6, EB did not evidence any hyperplasia. EB were inadequate for assessment in 24.5% and 47.5% of patients in the CA and MP groups, respectively. CA was found to be as protective as P (96.3% and 92.0% of success). However, the hormonal status of the endometrium differed (P<0.001): a secretory endometrium was found in 81.5% of the CA patients, compared to 50.7% in the P group. These transformations resulted in predictable, cyclic bleeding in 94.5% of the CA patients, compared to only 62.3% of the P patients (P=0.0001). Unscheduled bleeding, spotting and/or metrorrhagia, were more frequent under P than under CA (17.9% and 13.7%, respectively). The beneficial effects on hot flushes were more important in the CA group than in the P (P<0.001). At Month 18, the biopsy and clinical results were similar to those obtained at Month 6. The safety profile, particularly the lipid one, was similar in both groups, except for drowsiness and dizziness, which were significantly more frequent under P than under CA.; The progestative effects of CA on the endometrium and on menopause-related symptoms were at least as good as those of P. Moreover, CA resulted more often than P in secretory effects, and in satisfying bleeding patterns.",E,E

Trimegestone has been developed for use in conjunction with oestrogen for postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The dose of trimegestone required for endometrial safety was optimised in a dose ranging study. Oral trimegestone was administered at 0.05, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/day, days 15 - 28 along with continuous oral micronised oestradiol at 2 mg daily. The majority of women in the four dose groups experienced relief of climacteric symptoms by the end of the third treatment cycle. The incidence of pre-menstrual tension-like symptoms was low and did not differ between the four dose groups. After 6 months of treatment, the bleeding pattern showed a clear dose-dependent modulation such that the higher the dose of trimegestone administered the more predictable was the day of onset of bleeding and the shorter and lighter the bleeding episodes became. This was further confirmed in another study comparing trimegestone in 0.5 and 0.25 mg doses to norethisterone acetate, where women on the 0.5 mg dose experienced more favourable bleeding pattern compared with the lower dose of 0.25 mg or to norethisterone acetate. In the dose ranging study, 96% of endometrial specimens obtained at the end of the study had secretory changes. The lipoprotein profile measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months during the dose ranging study confirmed the fact that trimegestone, irrespective of the dose, did not negate the beneficial effects of oestrogen on lipids.; trimegestone is an effective and well-tolerated new progestin, which does not negate the beneficial effects of oestrogen on lipids.",E,E

Raloxifene competes with endogenous estrogen for binding to estrogen receptors in breast tissue. A woman's estradiol level may alter the effects of raloxifene on breast cancer and other outcomes.; To test the hypothesis that raloxifene reduces breast cancer risk more in women with relatively high estradiol levels than in women with very low estradiol levels.; Analysis of the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 1994 to 1999.; One hundred eighty community settings and medical practices in 25 countries including the United States.; A total of 7290 postmenopausal women aged 80 years or younger with osteoporosis who had baseline serum estradiol concentrations measured by a central laboratory using a sensitive assay.

Women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L in the raloxifene group had a rate of breast cancer that was 76% (95% CI, 53%-88%) lower than that of women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L in the placebo group (absolute rate reduction, 2.2% [95% CI, 1.0%-3.5%; number needed to treat = 45]). In contrast, women with undetectable estradiol levels had similar breast cancer risk whether or not they were treated with raloxifene (risk difference, -0.1%; 95% CI, -0.8% to 0.6%; P =.02 for the interaction). In this cohort, treating women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L with raloxifene for 4 years would have avoided 47% of breast cancer cases.; Measurement of estradiol level by sensitive assay in postmenopausal women identifies those at high risk of breast cancer who may benefit most from raloxifene. If confirmed, this suggests that measuring estradiol and treating women with high estradiol levels could substantially reduce the rate of breast cancer among postmenopausal women.",E,E

This study was designed to characterize potential mood effects of single doses of transdermal estradiol in healthy postmenopausal women who were not taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Twelve women participated in a five-session, within-subjects, double-blind study, in which they received placebo, transdermal estradiol (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg), or D-amphetamine (15 mg, oral) in a randomized order. Amphetamine was included as a positive control. Dependent measures included self-report measures of mood, physiological measures, and plasma hormone levels. Despite dose-dependent increases in plasma estradiol levels, and despite the fact that D-amphetamine produced its prototypic stimulant-like effects in these postmenopausal women, estradiol did not produce effects on mood. The finding that acute administration of exogenous estradiol did not alter mood suggests that more chronic exposure to estradiol is needed to produce mood-enhancing effects.",E,E

Group A: 50 patients received HRT with estradiol valerate and cyproterone acetate (Pausene(R)); Group B: 50 patients were used as a control group (treated with Cacit Vitamin D30(R)). A number of clinical and instrumental tests were performed at 0, 6 and 12 months to evaluate any changes in vasomotor and urogenital symptoms, bone and serum homeostasis and possible sexual disorders. The statistical analysis was performed using the c2 test.; The group of women receiving HRT showed a significant reduction in vasomotor clinical symptoms (p<0.001) and sexual disorders (p<0.002); this was not reflected in the control group where libido decreased steadily with apparent slight improvements only at the end of the study. The urogenital disorders disappeared almost completely in Group A, whereas they diminished in Group B.

Patients were randomized into two groups according to whether they did not (group 1, n = 12) or did (group 2, n = 12) have intracoronary treatment with oestrogen. Quantitative coronary angiography was monitored at baseline, immediately after successful angioplasty, and 15 min after the last deflation. Blood samples for measuring the levels of endothelin-1 were drawn from the ascending aorta and the coronary sinus simultaneously before angioplasty and 15 min after balloon dilatation.; The diameters of the coronary artery at the dilated segments were significantly reduced 15 min after dilation compared with those immediately after dilation in group 1 from 3.20 +/- 0.22 to 2.30 +/- 0.23 mm (P < 0.001), respectively.

At the end of the study, 85% of the women receiving 1 mg E2/0.5 mg NETA and 71% of the women receiving 1 mg E2/0.25 mg NETA were considered to the clinically adequate responders to treatment. Both combinations were associated with significant improvements, compared to placebo, in visual analog scales for overall general condition, Kupperman Menopausal Index, and Greene Climacteric vasomotor and psychological subscales. While both combinations resulted in similar bleeding profiles in postmenopausal women, the combination of 1 mg E2/0.5 mg NETA resulted in the lowest incidence of bleeding in late perimenopausal women.; The combinations of 1 mg E2/0.25 mg NETA and 1 mg E2/0.5 mg NETA rapidly relieve vasomotor symptoms and are efficacious in the majority of menopausal women, including those with severe hot flushes.",I,I

In the first study 65 women, unexposed to estrogen (-E study), age 70.8 +/- 0.8 years (mean +/- SEM) were all treated with calcium (Ca) 1.0-1.2 g daily and ergocalciferol (D) 0.25 mg per 25 kg once weekly and were randomly assigned to cyclical NaF (6 months on, 3 months off, initial dose 60 mg/day; group F CaD, n = 34) or no NaF (group CaD, n = 31). In the second study 34 patients, age 65.5 +/- 1.2 years, on hormone replacement therapy (E) at baseline, had this standardized, and were all treated with Ca and D and similarly randomized (FE CaD, n = 17; E CaD, n = 17) (+E study). The patients were stratified according to E status and subsequently assigned randomly to +/- NaF. Seventy-five patients completed the trial. Both groups treated with NaF showed an increase in lumbar spinal density (by DXA) above baseline by 27 months: FE CaD + 16.2% and F CaD +9.3% (both p = 0.0001). In neither group CaD nor E CaD did lumbar spinal density increase. Peripheral bone loss occurred at most sites in the F CaD group at 27 months: tibia/fibula shaft -7.3% (p = 0.005); femoral shaft -7.1% (p = 0.004); distal forearm -4.0% (p=0.004); total hip -4.1% (p = 0.003); and femoral neck -3.5% (p = 0.006). No significant loss occurred in group FE CaD. Differences between the two NaF groups were greatest at the total hip at 27 months but were not significant [p < 0.05; in view of the multiple bone mineral density (BMD) sites, an alpha of 0.01 was employed to denote significance in BMD changes throughout this paper]. Using Cox's proportional hazards model, in the -E study there were significantly more patients with first fresh vertebral fractures in those treated with NaF than in those not so treated (RR = 24.2, p = 0.008, 95% CI 2.3-255). Patients developing first fresh fractures in the first 9 months were markedly different between groups: -23% of F CaD, 0 of CaD, 29% of FE CaD and 0 of E CaD. The incidence of incomplete (stress) fractures was similar in the two NaF-treated groups. Complete nonvertebral fractures did not occur in the two +E groups; there were no differences between groups F CaD and CaD. Baseline BMD (spine and femoral neck) was related to incident vertebral fractures in the control groups (no NaF), but not in the two NaF groups.

One hundred and sixty healthy, hysterectomized postmenopausal volunteers aged 40-60 years with serum estradiol levels < 20 pg/ml were started on treatment at four centers in The Netherlands. Every 6 months, bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spine, non-dominant wrist and left hip, and markers of bone turnover were assessed in urine and serum. The treatment arms were: estradiol, 100 microg/day (E-100, n = 53), oestradiol, 50 microg/day (E-50, n = 54), placebo (P-100, placebo to E-100, n = 27 or P-50, placebo to E-50, n = 26). Treatment was continued for up to 2 years. After 24 months, BMD of the lumbar spine in the E-100 group differed by 7.7% [5.8-9.5%] (mean [95% confidence interval]) from the placebo group and showed a mean (s.e.m.) increase in BMD from baseline of 5.9% (0.69%). For the E-50 group the difference compared with placebo was 6.2% [4.4-8.0%] and the absolute increase was 4.5% (0.62%); in the placebo group, the absolute change was -2.3% (0.48%). In the total wrist, the changes were: E-100: difference compared with placebo 2.5% [1.5 3.6%], absolute increase 0.6% (0.3%); E-50: difference compared with placebo 2.9% [1.8-3.9%], absolute increase 0.7% (0.25%); and absolute change on placebo: -2.5% (0.35%). In the total hip, the changes were: E-100: difference compared with placebo 3.7% [2.2-5.2%], absolute increase 2.8% (0.5%); E-50: difference compared with placebo: 3.2% [1,8-4.7%], absolute change 2.4% (0.36%); and absolute change on placebo -1.4% (0.66%). Three markers of bone turnover--serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin and urinary CTX--fell significantly during the trial. Breast pain was reported by 8% of women on placebo, by 6% of women on E-50 and by 17% of women on E-100. Estradiol delivered by the E-50 matrix patch effectively reversed bone loss in hysterectomized postmenopausal women with few side-effects. The marginal additional gain in BMD with the higher dose may be offset by a more important side effect profile.",I,I

Estrogens or estrogen-progestins have been used to alleviate vasomotor symptoms. However, estrogen-androgen (E/A) therapy is also used for vasomotor symptom relief and has been shown to increase lean body mass while decreasing fat mass. The objective of this 16-wk, double-blind, randomized, parallel group clinical trial was to compare esterified estrogen plus methyltestosterone (1.25 mg estrogen + 2.5 mg methyltestosterone/d; E/A group) vs. esterified estrogen alone (1.25 mg/d; E group) on body composition. Forty postmenopausal women (mean age, 57 yr) participated.

Lower body strength increased by 23.1 kg (51 lb) in the E/A group vs. only 11 kg (24.25 lb) in the E group (P = 0.002 between groups). A statistically significant increase in weight (2.7 +/- 5.1 vs. 0.1 +/- 4.6 lb; P < 0.05) was observed in the E/A group compared with the E group. When subjects were given self-reporting questionnaires, more improvement was noted in sexual functioning and quality of life in the E/A group when compared with patients receiving E alone. There were no noteworthy side effects.

Agents that significantly reduced nonvertebral fracture risk also appear to produce larger mean increases in bone mineral density (BMD) and reductions in biochemical markers (BCM) of bone turnover, compared with other agents. To examine the extent to which increases in BMD and reductions in BCM during antiresorptive therapy are associated with reductions in risk of nonvertebral fractures, we performed a meta-analysis of all randomized, placebo-controlled trials of antiresorptive agents conducted in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (i.e. prior vertebral fracture or low BMD) with available relevant data. A total of 18 such trials with usable data were identified, including a total of 2,415 women with incident nonvertebral fractures over 69,369 women-years of follow-up. Poisson regression was used to estimate the association between changes in BMD or BCM during the first year and overall reductions in risk of nonvertebral fractures (vs. the placebo group) across all trials. Larger increases in BMD and larger reductions in BCM were significantly associated with greater reductions in nonvertebral fracture risk. For example, each 1% increase in spine BMD at 1 yr was associated with an 8% reduction in nonvertebral fracture risk (P = 0.02). Mean BMD changes at the hip were smaller than at the spine, but the predicted net effect on fracture risk was the same; an agent that increases spine BMD by 6% at 1 yr reduces nonvertebral fracture risk by about 39%, and an agent that increases hip BMD by 3% at 1 yr reduces nonvertebral fracture risk by about 46%. The results also predict that a 70% reduction in resorption BCM would reduce risk by 40%, and a 50% reduction in formation BCM would reduce risk by 44%. It appears that either BMD or BCM changes are able to explain the effect of treatment, because a separate variable for treatment was not independently significant in any models. These data demonstrate that larger increases in BMD at both the spine and hip and larger reductions in both formation and resorption BCM are associated with greater reductions in the risk of nonvertebral fractures. Antiresorptive agents that do not produce large increases in BMD or large reductions in BCM do not appear to and would not be expected to decrease the risk of nonvertebral fractures.",E,E

Both cross sectionally and longitudinally, bone loss in untreated women was greatest closest to menopause and declined thereafter (r = 0.34, p < 0.01 for lumbar spine bone loss and r = 0.25, p < 0.05 for femoral neck bone loss when correlated with number of years since menopause), such that the loss was eliminated in the femoral neck and bone mass increased in the spine in women >10 years after menopause. In contrast, bone turnover was consistently elevated throughout postmenopause, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The association with number of years since menopause was counteracted by both 1 and 2 mg estradiol combined with gestodene, piperazine, estrone sulfate in combination with norethisterone, and a combination of 2 mg estradiol and 1 mg norethisterone acetate. In addition, the response to various HRT regimens was independent of baseline bone mass. Whereas bone loss was significantly related to number of years since menopause, all HRT regimens applied arrested bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women, regardless of number of years since menopause.",E,E

We have previously reported that PvuII polymorphism of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha) gene is associated with bone loss rate, fracture risk, and response to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in early postmenopausal Finnish women.; We studied the influence of the ER alpha genotype on fall risk and muscle strength in a 5-year randomized HRT trial of 331 early postmenopausal women (subgroup of the population-based OSTPRE study, Kuopio, Finland). A 5-year postal inquiry in May 1994 included questions on falls during the previous 12 months. Grip strength was measured with dynamometer. The ER alpha gene polymorphism was analysed using PCR and PvuII restriction enzyme digestion. RESULTS. In all, 97 out of the 331 women reported falls. Half of those (56%) were slip falls, mostly during the winter season. In the HRT group, the ER alpha genotype was associated with fall risk (P = 0.002, logistic regression). The risk of falls (RR) was higher in women with the PP genotype than in those with the Pp (RR = 5.26, 95% CI 1.98-13.94, P = 0.001) or the pp (RR = 3.84, 95% CI 1.46-10.12, P = 0.007) genotype. When the falls were divided into slip (environment-related) and non-slip (endogenous) falls, the non-slip falls were associated with the genotype (P = 0.004), but the slip falls were not so clearly (P = 0.061). When all falls and non-slip falls were adjusted to the number of chronic health disorders and the variable time-since-menopause, the difference between the genotypes persisted (P = 0.003 and P = 0.010, respectively). In the non-HRT group, the ER alpha genotype was not associated with fall risk. The baseline or the 5-year grip strength values were not influenced by the ER alpha genotype. In conclusion, ER alpha polymorphism is associated with fall risk, especially with non-slip falls, in early postmenopausal Finnish women during the HRT. We have previously reported that, during HRT, women with the P allele have decreased fracture risk and that they may preferentially derive benefit from the positive effect of HRT on BMD. This suggests that the influence of ER alpha polymorphism may depend on the target tissue (bone versus the nervous system).; In these early postmenopausal, non-osteoporotic and relatively healthy women, the increased fall risk associated with the PP genotype was not associated with increased fracture risk, possibly due to improved bone strength during the HRT although falls generally predispose to fractures.",E,E

Bone turnover markers followed a similar pattern, and none of the changes in biochemical concentrations differed significantly between groups.; All 3 interventions offer long-term feasibility for increasing calcium intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. The dietary addition of micronutrients implicated in skeletal physiology confers no obvious bone-sparing effect in healthy postmenopausal women beyond that of calcium and vitamin D alone. The attenuation over time in suppression of parathyroid hormone and bone turnover might help explain why nutrient intervention tends to have less of a bone-sparing effect than do skeletally active medications such as estrogen or bisphosphonates.",E,E

Ten women who completed the study received MPA (5 mg/day) as their progestogen, and 13 who completed the study received micronized, oil-suspended progesterone (200 mg/day) as their progestogen. All participants made daily assessments of mood using the Profile of Mood States and daily recordings of somatic symptoms. All subjects had plasma follicle-stimulating hormone of greater than 35 IU/L and had not had spontaneous vaginal bleeding for more than 1 year.; None of the hormone treatments had a detectable effect on mood. MPA users reported more vaginal bleeding and breast tenderness than progesterone users.; In contrast with the widely held belief among psychiatrists that progesterone depresses mood, neither of the progestogens we used in normal, nondepressed and nonanxious women showed this effect. Absence of an effect on mood was also found when the results of the two progestogens were combined. The lesser side effects of the micronized progesterone-containing regimen suggest that some women may prefer it to an MPA-containing regimen.",E,E

In a subsequent double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover treatment phase, subjects received either levetiracetam, 500 mg, or placebo twice daily concomitant with the oral contraceptive. Plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were measured on days 14 and 15 of the two treatment periods for the evaluation of the 24-h kinetic parameters, and an additional sample was collected on day 21 to determine the trough plasma concentrations. Serum progesterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were determined on days 13, 14, 15, and 21 of each cycle of the treatment phase.; The plasma concentration-time curves and pharmacokinetic parameters of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were not statistically different during concomitant treatment with either levetiracetam or placebo. The ratios of the log-transformed geometric mean areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs), maximal (Cmax) and minimal (Cmin) plasma concentrations, and trough concentrations on day 21 (C21) ranged from 99.12 to 99.96% for ethinyl estradiol and from 97.13 to 99.41% for levonorgestrel.

Cognitive functions were assessed at baseline and twice during treatment. Serum T and E2 levels were significantly increased in the T and T + LNG groups compared with baseline (P < 0.01) and T levels were significantly decreased in the LNG group (P < 0.05). Verbal memory significantly decreased in the LNG group (P < 0.01) and was maintained by coadministration of T in the T + LNG group. Divided attention was unaffected in the LNG group but improved significantly in the T + LNG group. In summary, decreased serum T levels induced by LNG or direct effects of the progestin, LNG, adversely affects verbal memory in normal young men.

Eighty healthy women, aged 50-57 years, at <5 years after the onset of menopause and with no previous use of HRT, were randomly assigned to one of four groups: HRT; exercise (Ex); HRT + Ex (ExHRT); and control (Co). HRT administration was conducted in a double-blind manner for 1 year using estradiol plus noretisterone acetate (Kliogest). The exercise groups participated in a 1 year progressive training program consisting of jumping and bounding activities. Subjects participated in two supervised sessions per week and were asked to perform a series of exercises at home 4 days/week. Bone measurements using a quantitative computed tomography scanner (Somatom DR, Siemens) were obtained from the proximal femur, midfemur, proximal tibia, and tibial shaft. Data were analyzed with a software program (BONALYSE 1.3) calculating density (g/cm(3)), cross-sectional area (CSA; mm(2)), and moments of inertia (I(max), I(min), I(polar)). In addition, the bone mass spectrum was determined as a function of the angular distribution around the bone mass center (polar distribution) and the distance from the bone mass center through the diaphyseal wall (radial distribution). After the 1 year period, there was an overall interaction of group x time in bone mineral density (BMD) at the proximal femur (p = 0.05) and tibial shaft (p = 0.035). Women in the ExHRT and HRT groups had increased proximal femur and tibial shaft BMD when compared with the change observed in the Co group (p = 0.024-0.011). The change was more pronounced in the cortical tibia, wherein the ExHRT group also differed from the Ex group (p = 0.038). No significant changes were found in bone CSA at any of the measured sites. The radial distribution indicated an increase of BMD in the endocortical part of the measured sites in the HRT and ExHRT groups and in the proximal tibia in the Ex group. The polar distribution showed that bone mass was redistributed in the anteroposterior direction. The changes in I(max), I(min), and I(polar) in the HRT and ExHRT groups differed from those in the Co group at the proximal femur, midfemur, and proximal tibia (p = 0.047-0.001). The Ex group also differed from the Co group in I(max) and I(polar) at the proximal tibia (p = 0.018 and 0.039, respectively). These results support the idea that HRT acts primarily at the bone-marrow interface. The exercise intervention chosen for this study contributed to the maintenance of bone mass. Our results suggest that both HRT and exercise have local effects on bone mass. The change in bone mass distribution induced by HRT and exercise may play an important role in the alteration of bone strength.",I,I

In preclinical studies, ziprasidone was predicted to have efficacy against positive, negative and affective symptoms of schizophrenia with a favourable tolerability profile, including a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal adverse effects. The drug has been administered orally to >300 patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in published 4- to 6-week randomised, double-blind trials. When given twice daily at dosages of between 80 and 160 mg/day, ziprasidone produced significantly greater improvements in overall symptomatology than placebo. In the largest study, ziprasidone 80 or 160 mg/day was also significantly more effective than placebo in reducing negative symptoms and, at 160 mg/day, was significantly more effective than placebo in improving depressive symptoms in patients with associated clinically significant depression. Data from a 4-week trial indicate that ziprasidone 160 mg/day has similar efficacy to haloperidol 15 mg/day. Ziprasidone 40 to 160 mg/day was more effective than placebo with respect to prevention of impending relapse and improvement of negative symptoms in 294 stable patients with chronic schizophrenia who were treated for up to 1 year. In addition, significantly more ziprasidone than haloperidol recipients achieved a negative symptom response in a 28-week study involving 301 stable patients with chronic or subchronic schizophrenia. In general, oral ziprasidone is well tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. Importantly, the drug has a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects and a negligible effect on bodyweight. Ziprasidone is associated with slight prolongation of the QTc interval; the clinical significance of this is not yet clear. The drug does not appear to be associated with sustained elevation of plasma prolactin levels. Preliminary data indicate that long-term oral ziprasidone treatment is well tolerated. Ziprasidone is the only novel antipsychotic currently available in a rapid-acting intramuscular formulation. Short-term treatment with intramuscular ziprasidone was effective and well tolerated in patients with acute agitation associated with psychosis. In addition, intramuscular ziprasidone reduced agitation scores by a significantly greater extent than haloperidol in a study involving patients with acute agitation associated with psychosis.; Ziprasidone is a promising new antipsychotic that has shown significant efficacy in the oral treatment of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The drug is well tolerated with a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects and a negligible effect on bodyweight. In addition, intramuscular ziprasidone shows efficacy and good tolerability in the treatment of acute agitation associated with psychotic disorders.",E,E

Menopause also results in a decline in androgen levels with resulting symptoms of decreased libido and sexual dysfunction. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the treatment of postmenopausal women with androgens. However, no data are available on plasma viscosity and fibrinogen levels in postmenopausal women on combined oestrogen/androgen therapy.; We conducted a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group 16-week study evaluating the effects of methyltestosterone supplementation on plasma viscosity and fibrinogen levels in postmenopausal women already on oestrogen replacement therapy (ERT) for at least 3 months. Women 21 years and older who were menopausal (natural or surgical) for at least 12 months were enrolled in the study. Participants were randomized to (1) an oestrogen-only group taking 1.25 mg esterified oestrogen (E-group) and (2) an oestrogen plus methyltestosterone (1.25 mg esterified oestrogen and 2.5 mg methyltestosterone) group (EA-group). Progesterone was not administered during the study period and women with intact uteri were given medroxyprogesterone 10 mg daily for 14 days at the completion of the study.; After 16 weeks of treatment, both groups had a significant increase in serum oestradiol levels from baseline. The levels of total oestrogen were significantly higher in the E-group compared to the EA-group (P < 0.001). There was a greater decrease in the LH and SHBG levels in the EA-group (P = 0.01). There was no difference in total testosterone; however, free testosterone levels were significantly higher in the EA-group (P = 0.01). At the end of the study, there was a significant decrease in plasma viscosity only in the EA-group (P = 0.01). Fibrinogen levels increased in both the groups, reaching significance only in the EA-group (P = 0.006). Baseline weight, body mass index (BMI) and the duration of menopausal status did not have any significant impact on the changes in plasma viscosity or fibrinogen. Women in the EA-group showed significant reductions in total cholesterol (P = 0.009), high density lipoprotein (HDL) (P < 0.001) and triglyceride (TG) levels (P = 0.001). There was no significant change in these parameters in the E-group.; This prospective study shows that the treatment of postmenopausal women on oestrogen with low-dose oral methyltestosterone results in a significant reduction in plasma viscosity. This lowering of plasma viscosity was achieved despite an increase in fibrinogen levels. Significant lowering of lipoproteins, especially TG levels, might have been responsible for this benefit. The combination regimen did not result in major side-effects. Based on these results, we feel confident in recommending low-dose androgens to postmenopausal women with a history of sexual dysfunction and decreased libido.",E,E

This has been attributed to increased muscle strength by HRT. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of 6 months of HRT on muscle strength in postmenopausal women.; Forty postmenopausal women, aged 60-78 were included in the study. They were randomly divided in two groups with 20 women in each group. One group received Menorest 50 microg/24 h (estradiol 4.3 mg) and Gestapuran 2.5 mg (medroxyprogesteron) daily and the other group received placebo treatment. The study was conducted as a double blinded, prospective and placebo controlled trial. Hand grip strength, isokinetic knee flexion and extention, and physical activity were measured before treatment, after 3 and 6 months. Physical activity was estimated using a classification system of physical activity. A JAMAR hydraulic hand dynamometer and a Cybex II dynamometer were used to evaluate muscle strength.; Hand grip strength in the right hand, increased significantly in both groups (HRT P<0.001 and placebo P<0.01) and in the left hand in the HRT group (P<0.01). However, there were no differences in muscle strength between the two groups. There was no significant change in isokinetic knee flexion or extension after 6 months in either of the groups. The estimated physical activity increased slightly in the placebo group, but there was no significant difference compared to the treatment group.; Our data suggest that 6 months of HRT does not influence muscle strength in postmenopausal women.",E,E

The primary study end-point was recurrence-free survival (RFS) after 2 years. Secondary end-points included overall survival, adverse events and hormonal suppression.; Between 1995 and 1999, a total of 589 patients with breast cancer were randomized to treatment with leuprorelin acetate or CMF. The data of 227 patients were available for this first interim analysis. One hundred and ten and 117 patients were assigned to leuprorelin acetate and chemotherapy, respectively. Both treatment arms were well balanced for baseline characteristics. So far, no difference between the groups has emerged with respect to recurrence-free or overall survivaL Suppression of serum estradiol levels and menstruation was less marked in the CMF-group compared to the leuprorelin arm.

It is both potent and selective for the aromatase enzyme, with near-maximal suppression of serum oestrogens occurring at the clinical dose of 1 mg/day in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Anastrozole has also been shown to be a potent suppressor of intratumoural oestrogens, with responses comparable to those in serum. The results of two large, identically designed, randomised trials in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who had progressed on tamoxifen showed that oral anastrozole 1 mg/day produced a statistically significant survival advantage over megestrol acetate 40 mg q.i.d. The median duration of survival was 26.7 months for anastrozole versus 22.5 months for megestrol acetate. Anastrozole was as well-tolerated as megestrol acetate, while weight gain was significantly increased in the megestrol acetate group compared with the anastrozole group. In another Phase III clinical trial involving 1021 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, anastrozole showed a statistically significant advantage over tamoxifen in median time to progression in a combined analysis of 611 patients who were known to be oestrogen receptor- or progesterone receptor-positive. Anastrozole was as well-tolerated as tamoxifen, with a low rate of withdrawals (2%) due to drug-related adverse events. In addition, anastrozole was associated with fewer thromboembolic events and episodes of vaginal bleeding than tamoxifen. For women with hormone receptor-positive tumours who progress on tamoxifen, anastrozole is superior to megestrol acetate. In addition, anastrozole is a reasonable alternative to tamoxifen for first-line endocrine therapy of advanced breast cancer. Recent data confirm an emerging role for anastrozole as adjuvant therapy for primary breast cancer in postmenopausal patients. Anastrozole is also being investigated in the neoadjuvant setting.",E,E

The present study assessed the subjective and physiological effects of a single dose of D-amphetamine (AMPH; 15 mg oral) in healthy, normally cycling women (n=13), who received amphetamine and placebo (PL) during both the follicular and luteal phases of a single menstrual cycle, and in healthy men (n=7). Females reported greater amphetamine-induced subjective stimulation [Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI)-A, ARCI-MBG; Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ) Feel Drug, Feel High, Want More] during the follicular phase than the luteal phase. Within the follicular phase, the magnitude of individuals' AMPH-induced stimulation was positively associated with baseline (predrug) salivary estradiol [r=+.55-.78; Profile of Mood States (POMS) Vigor, Positive Mood, Elation], and negatively associated with salivary progesterone [r=-.66-.68; POMS Friendliness; Subjective States Questionnaire (SSQ) Pleasant Sedation]. Sex differences also emerged. Males reported feeling greater AMPH-induced stimulation (ARCI-A, ARCI-MBG; DEQ Feel Drug, Want More) than females in the luteal phase. Thus, higher levels of estrogen and lower levels of progesterone are associated with greater subjective stimulation after AMPH in women, and these hormonal influences contribute to sex differences in amphetamine responding.",E,E

A total of 75 patients in natural or surgical menopause suffering from at least seven hot flushes per day were randomized to receive during 4 months either soy isoflavone extract (total of 70 mg genistin and daidzin per day) or placebo.; There is evidence to suggest that 16 weeks of treatment with soy extract can help reduce the mean number of hot flushes per 24 hours in menopausal women. Withdrawals during this trial made it difficult to obtain an unbiased estimate of the true treatment effect, but numerous sensitivity analyses lend support to the suggestion that taking soy extract can be beneficial in the treatment of hot flushes. In particular, women taking soy extract had a 38% reduction in the mean number of hot flushes by week 4 and a 51% reduction by week 8. By the end of week 16, patients taking soy extract had a 61% reduction in their daily hot flushes versus a 21% reduction obtained with the placebo.

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three doses of the EMTDS (0.025, 0.05, or 0.075 mg/day) or placebo administered twice weekly. Lumbar bone mineral density (LBMD) was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at screening and after 1 and 2 years of treatment. Safety was assessed at regularly scheduled visits.; EMTDS provided statistically significant and clinically meaningful changes in LBMD relative to placebo. At 2 years, LBMD declined from baseline by 0.59% in the placebo group, but it increased from baseline by 1.65% ( = 0.0065), 4.08% ( = 0.0001), and 4.82% ( = 0.0001) in the EMTDS 0.025, 0.05, and 0.075 mg/day groups, respectively.

12269863,Spotlight on rizatriptan in migraine.,Animals; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Serotonin Receptor Agonists; Treatment Outcome; Triazoles; Tryptamines,"Wellington, Keri; Jarvis, Blair","Rizatriptan is an orally active serotonin 5-HT(1) receptor agonist that potently and selectively binds to 5-HT(1B/1D) subtypes. Earlier clinical trials demonstrated that rizatriptan 5 or 10mg is more effective than placebo at providing pain relief and a pain-free state, relieving associated symptoms of migraine, normalising functional ability and improving patient quality of life, and showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recently, rizatriptan 10mg was shown to be more effective than zolmitriptan 2.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg at producing a pain-free state 2 hours postdose. Furthermore, compared with naratriptan, significantly more patients who received rizatriptan were pain free or had pain relief from 1 hour onwards. The number of patients with normal functional ability at 2 hours was significantly higher after rizatriptan than after naratriptan or zolmitriptan. Rizatriptan was also generally more effective than zolmitriptan or naratriptan at relieving migraine-associated symptoms. Rizatriptan is generally well tolerated, and adverse events are usually mild and transient. The most common adverse events associated with rizatriptan in recent randomised trials were asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and nausea. There was a trend towards a lower incidence of adverse events with rizatriptan compared with zolmitriptan (31.2 vs 38.8%). However, rizatriptan was associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse events than naratriptan (39 vs 29%). The incidence of chest pain was similar after the administration of rizatriptan, zolmitriptan or naratriptan (2-4%). In conclusion, rizatriptan is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine. Oral rizatriptan 5 and 10mg have shown greater efficacy than placebo in providing pain relief, an absence of pain, relief from associated symptoms, normal functional ability and an improvement in patient quality of life. Earlier results showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recent studies have shown that rizatriptan 10mg provides faster pain relief and a higher percentage of patients with an absence of pain and normal functional ability at 2 hours than naratriptan 2.5mg or zolmitriptan 2.5mg. The efficacy of rizatriptan is retained when used in the long term, and the drug is generally well tolerated. Although well designed studies comparing rizatriptan with almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan would further define the position of rizatriptan, current data suggest that rizatriptan should be considered as a first-line treatment option in the management of migraine.",E,E

We therefore investigated the vascular effects of long-term contraceptive DMPA in young women.; Endothelium-dependent (hyperemia-induced flow-mediated dilatation [FMD]) and -independent (glyceryl trinitrate [GTN]) changes in brachial artery area were measured using cardiovascular magnetic resonance in 13 amenorrheic DMPA users (>1 year use; mean age 29+/-4 years) and in 10 controls (mean age 30+/-4 years, P=0.25) with regular menstrual cycles after validation of the technique. FMD and GTN responses were measured just before repeat MPA injection and 48 hours later (n=12) in DMPA users and during menstruation and midcycle (n=9) in controls. Serum-estradiol levels (S-estradiol) were measured at both visits. FMD was reduced in DMPA users compared with controls during menstruation (1.1% versus 8.0%, respectively P<0.01) without differences in GTN responses. S-estradiol levels in DMPA users were significantly lower than in controls during menstruation (58 versus 96 pmol/L, P<0.01). High levels of circulating MPA 48 hours after injection were not linked to an additional impairment in FMD (2.0% versus 3.1%, P=0.23). Estradiol levels were significantly correlated to FMD (r=0.43, P<0.01).; Endothelium-dependent arterial function measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance is impaired in chronic users of DMPA, and hypoestrogenism may be the mechanism of action.

Oral ERT-induced increases in plasma triglyceride, however, decrease LDL particle size, which may counteract this antioxidant effect. Because transdermal ERT decreases plasma triglyceride, it may not decrease LDL particle size and may preserve estrogen's antioxidant effect. The present study investigates whether transdermal ERT can eliminate the adverse effects of oral ERT on the size and oxidative susceptibility of LDL in postmenopausal women.; Postmenopausal women received no treatment (n=12) or were treated with either 0.625 mg oral conjugated equine estrogen daily (n=16) or with transdermal estradiol (50 microg/d, n=16) for 3 months. Plasma lipids and the diameter of LDL particles were determined. Susceptibility of LDL to oxidation was analyzed by incubation with CuSO4 and subsequent measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) concentrations. Oral ERT significantly increased plasma triglyceride and decreased LDL diameter but did not affect LDL-derived TBARS concentrations. In contrast, transdermal ERT significantly decreased the concentrations of plasma triglyceride and LDL-derived TBARS and significantly increased LDL diameter. Estrogen-induced changes in LDL diameter correlated negatively with changes in plasma triglyceride (r=-0.51, P<0.001) and LDL-derived TBARS (r=-0.50, P<0.001).; Because transdermal, but not oral ERT, decreases plasma triglyceride and produces larger LDL particles that are resistant to oxidation, the antioxidant effect of estrogen can be preserved.",E,E

OPG has been shown to be an important inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation and activation in rodent models. Estrogen is known to suppress bone resorption, and the action of estrogen on bone may be mediated by OPG. The relationship between endogenous estrogen and circulating OPG levels and bone status in human populations is unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between biochemical markers of bone turnover and bone density and circulating OPG and endogenous estradiol levels in a population-based cohort of postmenopausal women. Subjects were 180 women ages 55-91 yr (mean age, 67 yr). Serum estradiol was measured using an auto-analyzer. Serum concentrations of OPG were determined by ELISA. Markers of bone formation and resorption were measured by standard methods. Bone mineral density at total body, total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. There was a significant inverse relationship between estradiol and all bone turnover markers (r-values from -0.46 to -0.23; P < 0.05). Serum estradiol was positively related to absolute bone density at all sites and to change in bone density at the hip and femoral neck by univariate analysis (r-values from 0.15-0.29; P < 0.05). We observed a weak inverse association between OPG and serum-based bone turnover markers (r-values -0.18 and -0.16; P < 0.05). There was a significant positive relationship between OPG and bone mineral density at total body, total hip, and femoral neck (r-values from 0.17-0.2; P < 0.05) by univariate analysis, which was lost after adjustment for age and body mass index. There was a significant weak positive relationship between circulating OPG and serum estradiol (r = 0.18; P < 0.02). We observed no significant relationships between OPG and bone turnover markers measured in urine. We conclude that the variation in circulating endogenous estradiol levels is an important factor contributing to levels of bone turnover and bone density at the menopause. Our observations also suggest that circulating levels of OPG may reflect OPG activity in bone and are related to circulating endogenous levels of estradiol. We have previously reported high levels of variability in urine markers of bone resorption, and we suggest that this could account for the absence of a significant association between these markers and circulating OPG.",E,E

In this trial over 2 years, the highest significant increase from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) at all sites was observed with HRT; in addition, HRT showed a significantly greater increase in BMD at lumbar spine than tibolone. Randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that tibolone produces positive effects on BMD. Nevertheless, no clinical convincing data are available to support its efficacy in the prevention of osteoporotic fractures. The positive impact on BMD of conventional HRT to prevent postmenopausal bone loss and to treat established osteoporosis has been shown by many randomized controlled trials. Regarding fracture risk prevention, some clinical and epidemiological data suggest that HRT initiated in early or late postmenopause may prevent fractures if it is administered at standard doses and continued for a long time.; HRT is always the reference treatment of postmenopausal symptoms related to estrogen deficiency.",E,E

In the NEO group, hormone levels fell 3 wk after the initial LHRH-A injection, and deoxypyridinoline increased significantly (P = 0.006). At BL, the EST group had higher bone turnover due to the longer duration of LHRH-A treatment. With E(2) treatment, E(2) levels rose into the normal male range, and two resorption markers decreased significantly from BL by 33% for NTX (P < 0.001) and 28% for CTX (P = 0.009).

After discontinuing therapy for 2 yr, there was rapid bone loss in all 3 treatment groups, and most of the decrease in BMD occurred in the first year. In the ERT/HRT group, spine BMD increased 5.5% in yr 3, decreased 3.2% in yr 4, and decreased 0.7% in yr 5; femoral neck BMD increased 3.7% in yr 3, decreased 2.5% in yr 4, and decreased 0.4% in yr 5; total body BMD increased 2.1% in yr 3, decreased 1.4% in yr 4, and decreased 0.6% in yr 5. In the combination group, spine BMD increased 7.1% in yr 3, decreased 4.3% in yr 4, and decreased 0.3% in yr 5; femoral neck BMD increased 4.5% in yr 3, decreased 3.0% in yr 4, and decreased 0.01% in yr 5; total body BMD increased 2.2% in yr 3, decreased 1.5% in yr 4, and decreased 0.6% in yr 5. In the calcitriol group, spine BMD increased 1.8% in yr 3, decreased 1.8% in yr 4, and showed no change in yr 5; femoral neck BMD increased 0.2% in yr 3, decreased 0.2% in yr 4, and decreased 0.6% in yr 5; total body BMD decreased 0.4% in yr 3, decreased 0.6% in yr 4, and decreased 0.4% in yr 5. Compared with placebo, all treated groups at yr 5 had significantly higher total body BMD; only the combination group had significantly higher spine BMD (3.4%; P < 0.001) and total hip BMD (2.4%; P < 0.01.) compared with the placebo group. Compared with baseline, only spine BMD in the combination group was significantly higher (2.6%; P < 0.001) at yr 5. The increase in calcium absorption and the decrease in serum PTH levels in the calcitriol groups were reversed after discontinuation of treatment, and the decrease in bone markers was reversed in the hormone-treated groups. These results suggest that discontinuation of ERT/HRT and/or calcitriol therapy in elderly women leads to a decrease in much of the BMD gained on treatment; however, in the combination group there was a statistically significant residual effect on spine BMD.",E,E

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a 1-yr course of oral DHEA treatment vs. conventional hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) in young women with AN. Sixty-one young women were randomly assigned to receive oral DHEA (50 mg/d) or HRT (20 micro g ethinyl estradiol/0.1 mg levonorgestrel). Anthropometric, nutrition, and exercise data were acquired every 3 months, and bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) every 6 months over 1 yr. Serum samples were obtained for measurements of hormones, proresorptive cytokines, and bone formation markers, and urine was collected for determinations of bone resorption markers at each visit. In initial analyses, total hip BMD increased significantly and similarly (+1.7%) in both groups. Hip BMD increases were positively correlated with increases in IGF-I (r = 0.44; P = 0.030) and the bone formation marker, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase increased significantly only in the DHEA treatment group (P = 0.003). However, both groups gained significant amounts of weight over the year of therapy, and after controlling for weight gain, no treatment effect was detectable. There was no significant change in lumbar BMD in either group. Both bone formation markers, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, increased transiently at 6-9 months in those subjects receiving DHEA compared with the estrogen-treated group (P < 0.05). Both DHEA and HRT significantly reduced levels of the bone resorption markers, urinary N-telopeptides (P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between changes in IGF-I and changes in weight, body fat determined by DXA, and estradiol for both groups. In addition, patients receiving DHEA exhibited improvement on three validated psychological instruments (Eating Attitudes Test, Anorexia Nervosa Subtest, and Spielberger Anxiety Inventory). Both DHEA and HRT had similar effects on hip and spinal BMD. Over the year of treatment, maintenance of both hip and spinal BMD was seen, but there was no significant increase after accounting for weight gain. Compared with HRT, DHEA appeared to have anabolic effects, evidenced by the positive correlation between increases in hip DXA measurements and IGF-I and significant increases in bone formation markers. Both therapies significantly decreased bone resorption. Replicating results from studies of the elderly, DHEA resulted in improvements in specific psychological parameters in these young women.",E,E

The primary outcome measure was the mean daily number of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, as recorded in patient diaries.; A total of 165 patients were randomized. The mean daily number of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms decreased significantly more (p < 0.001) in the 150-microg/day (-7.86) and 300-microg/day (-9.39) groups than in the placebo group (-5.22). The decrease reached significance more rapidly with the 300-microg/day dose (from week 2) than with the 150-microg/day dose (from week 8). The rate of emergent adverse events with both doses was similar to that with placebo.; Pulsed estrogen therapy, achieved by intranasal estradiol 150 microg/day and 300 microg/day, significantlyreduced the incidence of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, compared with placebo. The 300-microg/day dose demonstrated a greater and more rapid therapeutic effect, with no clinically significant difference in tolerability, compared with the 150-microg/day dose, and therefore offers the best efficacy/safety ratio when initiating treatment with intranasal estradiol.",E,E

Women received either intranasal Aerodiol 300 microg/day (one spray delivery of 150 microg per nostril) or an oral estradiol 2 mg for 24 weeks. Severity of symptoms were compared based on the Kupperman index (KI) at the end of 24 weeks.; The KI score decreased markedly in both groups between W0 and W24. At W24, the two treatments were shown to be statistically equivalent (P<0.001). The incidence of adverse events was very similar in both groups; those related to treatment were of mild or moderate intensity in 95% of cases for the nasal group and 90% for the oral group.; In conclusion, pulsed estrogen therapy using Aerodiol is safe, easily used and highly efficient in alleviating postmenopausal symptoms with a dose of 300 microg. The dose of 300 microg in one administration per day offers the optimal therapy whilst being easily adaptable to each patient's clinical response.",E,E

Estrogen treatment in the postmenopausal woman has several proven benefits for those who have vasomotor symptoms or problems related to urogenital atrophy. However, the most controversial area is in the long-term preventive benefits of estrogen against the development of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, particularly in women older than 60 years. It is in these areas that decisions on the dose and optimal route of administration of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) must be made. Although adding a progestogen to an ERT regimen is mandatory, particularly in a woman with an intact uterus, discussion now focuses on which progestogen least attenuates the beneficial effects of estrogen. Emerging trends suggest that lower doses of estrogen (i.e. ethinylestradiol 5 microg/day, estradiol 0.25 mg/day or conjugated estrogens [CEE] 0.3 mg/day) continuously combined with lower doses of medroxyprogesterone (MPA) are equally effective at relieving vasomotor symptoms as the most commonly prescribed regimen in the US (CEE 0.625mg/MPA 2.5mg daily), with fewer adverse events, leading to greater patient acceptance and likelihood for continuation of therapy. This is especially important when therapy is initiated at an older age.",E,E

Dysfunction of central thermoregulatory centers caused by changes in estrogen levels at the time of menopause has long been postulated to be the cause of hot flashes. Treatment should begin with a careful patient history, with specific attention to the frequency and severity of hot flashes and their effect on the individual's function. For mild symptoms that do not interfere with sleep or daily function, behavioral changes in conjunction with vitamin E (800 IU/d) use is a reasonable initial approach. For more severe symptoms, the next step is to determine whether there is a contraindication or a personal reservation to estrogen replacement therapy. For women who are able and willing to use estrogen, it will successfully relieve symptoms by about 80% to 90%. In patients with a history of breast or uterine cancer, treatment with the progestational agent megesterol acetate appears to be a safe alternative that also decreases hot flashes by approximately 80%. For women unwilling or unable to use hormone therapy, one of the newer antidepressant agents can be prescribed. Venlafaxine decreases hot flashes by about 60%. Gabapentin is another drug that appears promising as therapy for women unable or unwilling to use estrogen, and the results of ongoing trials to determine its efficacy are eagerly awaited. The use of clonidine, methyldopa, and belladonna should be discouraged because of their modest efficacy and adverse effects.",E,E

Ospemifene (FC-1271a) is a novel SERM compound, which has been shown in animal models to have estrogen-like effects on bone and the cardiovascular system, while having antiestrogen-like effects in uterus and breast. In this study, we investigated the effects of ospemifene on the uterine endometrium, vaginal maturation index and hormonal status in healthy postmenopausal women.; The study was conducted as a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I study, where 40 healthy postmenopausal women volunteers were randomized to receive daily oral doses of ospemifene either 25, 50, 100 or 200 mg or placebo for 12 weeks. Vaginal ultrasonography and endometrial biopsy were performed and vaginal maturation index determined at baseline and at 12 weeks' visit. Serum concentrations of estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), parathyroid hormone and prolactin were determined from samples taken at baseline, at 4 days and at 4, 12, and 16 weeks' visits. Climacteric symptoms were assessed using 12 visual analogue scales (VAS) at baseline and at the end of the study.; No clinically significant changes were seen in endometrial thickness at any dose level. Ospemifene exerted a very weak estrogenic effect on endometrial histology. On the other hand, it induced a clear estrogenic effect on vaginal epithelium. Among the endocrine parameters only FSH and SHBG showed significant dose dependent changes; FSH decreased and SHBG increased during the treatment. In general, ospemifene was well tolerated. The 25 and 50 mg doses tended to reduce climacteric symptoms, but no statistically significant differences were observed between different doses of ospemifene and placebo. The highest dose level (200 mg) induced more subjective adverse reactions, especially hot flushes, than lower doses.; Our study suggests that a safe and well tolerated dose of ospemifene for potential clinical use may be between 25 and 100 mg. Further studies are needed to substantiate the results of this Phase I pilot study.",E,E

The mean change in testosterone AUC was also greater in the 100-mg dose group than 50-mg dose group (P = 0.0257). There was considerable individual variability in the changes of serum androstenedione, estrone, and testosterone levels in the treated groups with peak serum testosterone levels exceeding the upper limit of normal in 4 of 10 women in the 50-mg dose group and 6 of 10 in the 100-mg dose group. We concluded that the acute administration of both 50-mg and 100-mg of androstenedione increases serum testosterone and estrone levels, but not estradiol levels, in postmenopausal women. If these hormonal effects are sustained during long-term administration, regular use of this supplement by postmenopausal women could thus cause both beneficial and adverse effects.",E,E

Ten men [mean (SEM) age, 68 (2.5) yr; height, 171.5 (2.4) cm; and weight, 80 (3.0) kg] completed each of the following 1-month, double-blind interventions after a baseline (B) study in randomized order with an intervening 3-month washout: transdermal T patch (5.0 mg/daily); recombinant human GH (6.25 micro g/kg sc daily); and combined hormones (GHT). ANOVA with repeated measures was used to evaluate interventional effects. Integrated serum GH concentrations [mean (SEM)] were elevated comparably by GH and GHT: [B = 363 (55), GH = 1107 (120), T = 459 (131), and GHT = 1189 (46) micro g/liter.min; P < 0.0001].

Muscle IGF-I gene expression increased by 1.9-fold during GH administration and by 2.3-fold during GHT administration (P < 0.05, compared with B). Myostatin and androgen receptor gene expression were not affected. Serum osteocalcin increased in response to the GH and GHT interventions: [B = 4.8 (0.52), GH = 5.7 (0.54), T = 4.7 (0.33), and GHT = 5.5 (0.39); P <0.009]. There were no significant adverse events during 30 patient-months of intervention.

Secondary aims were to establish the relationship between menopausal age and the occurrence of irregular bleeding for both therapies and to assess the efficacy of both therapies in alleviating menopausal symptoms.; This was a stratified and randomised, open label study conducted with late peri and postmenopausal women at 35 sites in Austria and Germany. A total of 446 women were randomly allocated into two cohorts based on time since last bleeding and then stratified to either a low dose continuous combined therapy consisting of 1 mg E(2) and 0.5 mg NETA for 28 days or a sequential therapy consisting of 0.625 mg CEE for 28 days and 5 mg MG for the final 14 days. Bleeding and menopausal complaints were continuously assessed. Treatments were administered for 9 lunar months.; The incidence rate of women presenting irregular bleeding episodes including spotting during cycle 9 was 12.2% with 1mgE(2)/0.5mgNETA and 25.8% with 0.625mgCEE/5mgMG (P = 0.0014). In the group of postmenopausal women (time since last bleeding > or = 12 months) the incidence of irregular bleeding during cycle 9 was 11.0% for 1mgE(2)/0.5mgNETA and 25.0% for 0.625mgCEE/5mgMG). In the group of late perimenopausal women (time since last bleeding 6-11 months) the incidence of irregular bleeding was similar for both treatments at cycle 3, but markedly less in patients with 1mgE(2)/0.5mgNETA at cycle 6 and 9, being significantly different compared to patients with 0.625mgCEE/5mgMG at cycle 6 (P < 0.05). The cumulative rate of amenorrhea (no bleeding or spotting) achieved with 1mgE(2)/0.5mgNETA was 89% for the postmenopausal women and 83.7% for the late perimenopausal women. Both treatments relieved menopausal complaints equally effective.; Regarding the occurrence of irregular bleeding, the low dose continuous combined therapy was superior to the sequential therapy (0.625mgCEE/5mgMG). The low dose continuous combined E(2)/NETA regimen is also suitable for late perimenopausal women since more than 80% of the women had no bleeding or spotting after 9 months of treatment.",E,E

At baseline, 16% of women reported frequent hot flashes, 26% vaginal dryness, 10% genital irritation, 55% trouble sleeping, and 53% early awakening. Women assigned to hormone therapy reported less frequent hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and trouble sleeping compared with women assigned to placebo, but more frequent vaginal discharge, genital irritation, uterine bleeding, and breast symptoms. The reporting of breast symptoms among women in the hormone group decreased from 40% at 1 year to 13% by the 4th year. Uterine bleeding was reported by 31% and spotting by an additional 33% of women in the hormone group during the 1st year of treatment; by the 4th year, these proportions had fallen to 11% and 20%, respectively.; Symptoms typically attributed to menopause are common in elderly women. Postmenopausal hormone therapy reduces hot flashes, trouble sleeping, and vaginal dryness, but at standard doses in elderly women is associated with vaginal discharge, genital irritation, uterine bleeding, and breast symptoms.",E,E

Men aged 21-56 years received Maca in one of two doses: 1,500 mg or 3,000 mg or placebo. Self-perception on sexual desire, score for Hamilton test for depression, and Hamilton test for anxiety were measured at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. An improvement in sexual desire was observed with Maca since 8 weeks of treatment. Serum testosterone and oestradiol levels were not different in men treated with Maca and in those treated with placebo (P:NS). Logistic regression analysis showed that Maca has an independent effect on sexual desire at 8 and 12 weeks of treatment, and this effect is not because of changes in either Hamilton scores for depression or anxiety or serum testosterone and oestradiol levels. In conclusion, treatment with Maca improved sexual desire.",E,E

Hormone/estrogen replacement therapy (HRT/ERT) has a positive effect on both postcranial and oral bone. The objective of the study was to determine if the positive effect of HRT/ERT on alveolar crest height (ACH) is generalized or site specific.; The sample consisted of 49 women who completed a 3-year, HRT/ERT prospective study. Cemento-enamel junction distances (ACH) were measured on digitized images of bitewing radiographs. Lumbar spine and proximal femur bone mineral densities (BMDs) were determined with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometric scans. Measurements were made at baseline and at the end of year 3. For the 3-year study period, mean change in ACH was determined for each patient. In addition, the sites with the greatest, second and third greatest ACH changes were determined for each patient. Correlations between changes in ACH (as determined by the various methods) and postcranial BMD were determined.; Mean ACH changes had an average correlation (r) of -0.24 with femoral and lumbar spine BMDs. Although the largest site-specific change in ACH resulted in a mean correlation of -0.21, the correlations for the second and third largest changes in ACH dropped to -0.15 and -0.12. Overall, the correlations for site-specific changes were substantively smaller than those for generalized change.; The data of this study indicate that ACH change attributable to HRT/ERT is generalized rather than site specific. Studies of the effect of HRT/ERT on ACH should employ multiple measurements to minimize measurement errors associated with site-specific measurements.",E,E

Four well-designed, international studies investigating the efficacy of pulsed estrogen therapy on both the short- and long-term consequences of estrogen deprivation were conducted. Climacteric symptoms and their reduction were assessed individually and also using the Kupperman index, which is a weighted score. Aerodiol produced a significant reduction in the Kupperman index and in the occurrence of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats. This reduction appeared to be significant as early as the second week of treatment. Moreover, Aerodiol remained effective even among highly symptomatic women with more than seven hot flushes per day, and also among smokers. Since it avoids hepatic first-pass metabolism, pulsed estrogen therapy also has a favorable action on the lipid profile, decreasing lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore, Aerodiol is neutral with regard to clotting factors, angiotensinogen and insulin levels. The effect of pulsed estrogen therapy on bone has been assessed in both the short and the long term. Bone turnover, as measured by markers of resorption and formation, was normalized to premenopausal levels after 3 months of treatment at a dose of 300 microg/day. Aerodiol, again at the dose of 300 microg/day, is as effective as a 50-microg/day transdermal patch in increasing bone mineral density (p < 0.001 versus baseline) at the spine and hip after 56 weeks. Finally, data collected during the development of Aerodiol have shown that pulsed estrogen therapy is at least as effective as 2 mg of oral estrogen or 50 microg of transdermal estrogen in relieving climacteric symptoms and preventing postmenopausal bone loss.",E,E

The main objective of the current study was to evaluate the responsiveness of this instrument. Secondarily, this study provided an opportunity to extend the developer's psychometric validation. The Acne-QoL was utilized in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of the efficacy of Estrostep (norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol) in the treatment of facial acne; a total of 296 Estrostep and 295 placebo patients were evaluated. The Acne-QoL was completed at the beginning, middle (cycle 3), and end (cycle 6) of the 6-month treatment period. The responsiveness of the Acne-QoL was demonstrated through its ability to detect both small (baseline to mid-study) and moderate (baseline to study end) treatment advantages for Estrostep patients. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the subscale structure, and internal consistency estimates were excellent. Convergent and discriminant validity were supported by correlations between Acne-QoL scores and clinical measures that were both in the direction and relative magnitude hypothesized. Finally, item response theory analyses confirmed that each item is highly related to its subscale's latent construct and that each subscale is sensitive across a broad range of the underlying continuum. The results of this evaluation confirm that the Acne-QoL is responsive, internally consistent, and valid.",E,E

Fulvestrant (Faslodex((R)), ICI 182780, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals; Wilmington, Delaware) is a selective antagonist of estrogen designed to have no estrogenic effects. Lack of aqueous solubility led to the development of a parenteral formulation for monthly intramuscular administration. Fulvestrant has been shown to inhibit the proliferative effects of estrogen on sensitive tissues in vitro and in vivo, and is without apparent measurable estrogenic activity. The data upon which marketing approval for fulvestrant was based are summarized below. Eight hundred fifty-one postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer were enrolled in two phase III studies, 400 in a North American double-blind study and 451 in a European open-label study, comparing the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant with anastrozole. Four hundred twenty-eight patients were randomized to receive fulvestrant 250 mg monthly by intramuscular injection and 423 patients were to receive anastrozole 1 mg daily. Patients were considered hormone sensitive either by receptor status or previous response to endocrine therapy. Over 96% of patients had previously received tamoxifen, either in the adjuvant setting or as treatment for metastatic disease. The primary study end points were response rate and time to progression. Response rates for patients treated with fulvestrant were 17% and 20% in the North American and European trials, respectively, compared with 17% and 15% in the anastrozole treatment arms. There were no statistically significant differences in response rates, time to progression, or survival between treatment arms in either study. The most common adverse events attributed to the treatment (>10%) were injection-site reactions and hot flashes. Common events (1%-10%) included asthenia, headache, and gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), as well as rash and urinary tract infections. A small increase in joint disorders was reported in the anastrozole-treated patients. On April 25, 2002, fulvestrant 250 mg by monthly intramuscular injection was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy. Approval was based on similarity of response rates and time to progression between fulvestrant and anastrozole.",E,E

The cause of DMPA-associated bone loss is not known, but the relative estrogen deficiency induced by DMPA use could be responsible. We have undertaken a randomized, double-blind controlled trial of oral estrogen replacement therapy in 38 premenopausal women (mean age 37) with a minimum 2 yr DMPA use who had a below average baseline lumbar spine BMD (T score < or = 0). Nineteen women were allocated to receive conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg/d orally) and 19 to receive a matching placebo. All continued with regular DMPA injections throughout the study. Areal bone density was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total body sites every 6 months for 2 yr; the main outcome measure being the change in areal BMD at the lumbar spine. At baseline, the two groups were well matched for demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical variables, and for BMD. Twenty-seven subjects completed at least 18 months in the study, and 26 the full 2 yr, with similar numbers dropping out from each group (mainly for personal reasons). In the estrogen-treated group, mean lumbar spine BMD increased 1%, whereas in the placebo group it fell 2.6%, over 2 yr. The between group differences were 2.0% at 12 months (P = 0.058), 3.2% at 18 months (P < 0.01), and 3.5% at 24 months (P < 0.002).

Blood was sampled daily during treatments and at 10-min intervals for the next 24 h. Samples were assayed for LH, FSH, estradiol (E2), glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, insulin, cortisol, GH, IGF-I, IGF-I binding protein (IGFBP)-1, IGFBP-3, leptin, and T3. LH pulsatility was unaffected by an energy availability of 30 kcal/kg LBM.d (P > 0.3), but below this threshold LH pulse frequency decreased, whereas LH pulse amplitude increased (all P < 0.04). This disruption was more extreme in women with short luteal phases (P < 0.01). These incremental effects most closely resembled the effects of energy availability on plasma glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, GH, and cortisol and contrasted with the dependencies displayed by the other metabolic hormones (simultaneously P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that LH pulsatility is disrupted only below a threshold of energy availability deep into negative energy balance and suggest priorities for future investigations into the mechanism that mediates the nonlinear dependence of LH pulsatility on energy availability.",E,E

Thirty-two women desiring oral contraception were randomized to six 28-day cycles (standard group) or 168 days without a pill-free interval (continuous group). Participants kept a daily bleeding calendar documenting bleeding events (none, spotting or required sanitary protection) and side effects (headache, nausea, breast tenderness, depression, premenstrual syndrome and bloating). Primary outcome was number of bleeding days. Secondary outcomes included bleeding days requiring sanitary protection, amenorrhea, patient acceptability of bleeding patterns, method satisfaction and affective side effects. There were no differences in the baseline characteristics of the two groups. Although total bleeding days were fewer in the continuous group (mean = 25.9 vs. 34.9 days), this result did not reach statistical significance. However, women in the continuous group reported significantly fewer bleeding days that required protection (18.4 vs. 33.8 days, p < 0.01), and were more likely to have amenorrhea. Although both groups reported a high level of satisfaction with bleeding patterns and side effect profiles, women in the continuous group reported significantly fewer days of bloating (0.7 vs. 11.1 days, p = 0.04), and menstrual pain (1.9 vs. 13.3 days, p < 0.01). Continuous use of 20 microg ethinyl estradiol/100 microg levonorgestrel is associated with less bleeding requiring protection, and more amenorrhea than standard administration. Taken with or without a hormone-free interval, this oral contraceptive formulation is highly acceptable with regard to bleeding patterns and side effect profile. The continuous group had fewer light and moderate bleeding days, less bloating and menstrual pain. For patients who are seeking these results, this method may be more desirable.",E,E

Twenty-one women of the study group were prescribed an oral contraceptive (30 microg ethynyl estradiol and 150 microg levonorgestrel) and 20 women of the control group a nonhormonal contraceptive or none. Biochemical markers of bone metabolism (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, deoxypyridinoline) and VDR genotype, using BsmI endonuclease, were determined. After 3 months in the study group, the BB genotype subgroup showed significantly decreased osteocalcin (p = 0.010), in the Bb genotype subgroup bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.043) and osteocalcin (p = 0.006) decreased, and in the bb genotype subgroup no changes were observed. In the control group, there were no significant changes in markers of bone metabolism regarding VDR genotype. In conclusion, our study shows that in young women VDR gene polymorphism could influence bone metabolism during low-dose oral contraceptive use.",E,E

All of these attributes, however, are associated with increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP).; We evaluated interrelationships between CRP, the metabolic syndrome, and incident cardiovascular events among 14 719 apparently healthy women who were followed up for an 8-year period for myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular death; 24% of the cohort had the metabolic syndrome at study entry. At baseline, median CRP levels for those with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 characteristics of the metabolic syndrome were 0.68, 1.09, 1.93, 3.01, 3.88, and 5.75 mg/L, respectively (P(trend) <0.0001). Over the 8-year follow-up, cardiovascular event-free survival rates based on CRP levels above or below 3.0 mg/L were similar to survival rates based on having 3 or more characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. At all levels of severity of the metabolic syndrome, however, CRP added prognostic information on subsequent risk. For example, among those with the metabolic syndrome at study entry, age-adjusted incidence rates of future cardiovascular events were 3.4 and 5.9 per 1000 person-years of exposure for those with baseline CRP levels less than or greater than 3.0 mg/L, respectively. Additive effects for CRP were also observed for those with 4 or 5 characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. The use of different definitions of the metabolic syndrome had minimal impact on these findings.; These prospective data suggest that measurement of CRP adds clinically important prognostic information to the metabolic syndrome.",E,E

In addition to being a risk marker for cardiovascular disease, much recent data suggest that C-reactive protein (CRP) promotes atherogenesis via effects on monocytes and endothelial cells. The metabolic syndrome is associated with significantly elevated levels of CRP. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a marker of atherothrombosis, is also elevated in the metabolic syndrome and in diabetes, and endothelial cells are the major source of PAI-1. However, there are no studies examining the effect of CRP on PAI-1 in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs).; Incubation of HAECs with CRP results in a time- and dose-dependent increase in secreted PAI-1 antigen, PAI-1 activity, intracellular PAI-1 protein, and PAI-1 mRNA. CRP stabilizes PAI-1 mRNA. Inhibitors of endothelial NO synthase, blocking antibodies to interleukin-6 and an endothelin-1 receptor blocker, fail to attenuate the effect of CRP on PAI-1. CRP additionally increased PAI-1 under hyperglycemic conditions.; This study makes the novel observation that CRP induces PAI-1 expression and activity in HAECs and thus has implications for both the metabolic syndrome and atherothrombosis.",E,E

In turn, chronically elevated glucocorticoids increase circulating leptin. HPA axis hyperactivity occurs in 30-50% of patients with major depression, but the few prior reports of leptin measurements in this illness have shown inconsistent results. We, therefore, measured plasma leptin in 12 female and 8 male unipolar major depressives and 12 female and 8 male individually matched normal controls administered low-dose physostigmine (PHYSO) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) to stimulate the HPA axis. The subjects underwent four test sessions 5-7 days apart: PHYSO (8 microg/kg IV); AVP (0-08 U/kg IM); PHYSO+AVP; and saline control. Serial blood samples were taken before and after pharmacologic challenge and analyzed for leptin, ACTH(1-39), cortisol and AVP. Estradiol and testosterone also were measured at each test session. PHYSO and AVP produced no side effects in approximately half the subjects and predominantly mild side effects in the other half, with no significant patient-control differences. Correlations between side effects (absent or present) after PHYSO or AVP and the corresponding leptin responses were non-significant in all groups. Baseline plasma leptin concentrations (mean+/-S.D.) were significantly higher in the female patients compared to the female controls (22.5+/-13.9 ng/ml vs. 12.3+/-9.7 ng/ml), whereas they were similar in the male patients and the male controls (3.9+/-1.4 ng/ml vs. 3.6+/-2.0 ng/ml). Leptin concentrations following PHYSO remained unchanged from baseline, indicating that the short-lived ACTH and cortisol increases produced by PHYSO did not affect leptin secretion. In contrast, AVP administration, while also increasing ACTH and cortisol, significantly suppressed leptin, more so in the women than in the men. Baseline leptin and the leptin decrease after AVP were moderately positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Scale 'somatization' factor in the female patients (r=0.50) and more strongly correlated with the 'mood-depression' factor in the male patients (r=0.81). These findings indicate a sexual diergism (functional sex difference) in plasma leptin measures between major depressives and matched normal controls.",E,E

Jia-Wey Shiau-Yau San (JWSYS), one of the traditional Chinese herbal prescriptions, is a famous herbal remedy used for the management of various menopausal-related symptoms. A randomized, controlled pilot study was performed to evaluate the clinical effects of JWSYS compared with those of a continuous combined hormone replacement therapy, Premelle, on quality of life in non-hysterectomized postmenopausal women.; The present trial compared the effect of a l6-week treatment with JWSYS or HRT (Premelle) in postmenopausal women with climacteric symptoms. The Greene Climacteric Scale was used to assess the clinical effects at baseline and after 16 weeks' treatment with either JWSYS or Premelle. The physiological parameters, such as follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels, were also recorded at the same time points.; The results showed that JWSYS had a relatively lower discontinuation rate due to adverse effects, in particular the bleeding and breast tenderness. Both JWSYS and Premelle effectively alleviated most of the menopausal symptoms with no significant differences between treatment groups, whereas the beneficial effects of JWSYS were not mediated by hormone replacement-like effects. Moreover, JWSYS showed a good compliance and safety without estrogenic effects and metabolic alterations.; It was suggested that JWSYS was a safe and efficacious therapy and might be an alternative choice for relief of climacteric symptoms in postmenopausal women. However, the exact efficacy and clinical roles of JWSYS have not been convincingly demonstrated in this study because of the blinding approach and some statistical concerns, and only the possibility of its efficacy has been raised. Therefore, a blinding trial with more patient numbers to evaluate the efficacy of JWSYS deserves further study.",E,E

Twenty-four-hour ambulatory registration of blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. Contractile properties and endothelial function of subcutaneous small arteries from gluteal biopsies were studied with the wire-myograph technique.; Estrogen treatment reduced both ambulatory systolic blood pressure (5 mmHg, P = 0.05), diastolic blood pressure (3 mmHg, P < 0.05) and heart rate (6-8 beats/min during morning hours, P < 0.01). Diastolic blood pressure during and after mental stress was significantly reduced after estrogen treatment (p < 0.01). The levels of P-adrenaline and P-noradrenaline were similar in both treatment protocols. The contractile properties of the arteries were not significantly influenced by estrogen. Substance P induced nitric oxide-dependent relaxation in both estrogen-treated and placebo-treated precontracted arteries. Acetylcholine, on the other hand, induced a non-nitric oxide, non-prostanoid-dependent hyperpolarization, which was inhibited by potassium-induced depolarization after placebo but not after estrogen treatment.; Acute administration of transdermal estrogen in clinically relevant doses modulates hemodynamics, probably by an altered parasympathetic balance, which might involve changes at the muscarinic receptor level.",E,E

Major depression is also associated with typical sleep-endocrine changes, including enhanced activity of the HPA axis, while an influence of age and gender on these alterations is less clear. To test the hypothesis that after menopause sleep-endocrine alterations associated with major depression are accentuated, we examined the sleep EEG and nocturnal hormone secretion (ACTH, cortisol, GH, estradiol, LH, FSH, and leptin) in 16 drug-free female patients, mostly with the first episode of a major depressive disorder (seven pre- and nine postmenopausal subjects) and 19 female controls (10 subjects in the early follicular phase and nine postmenopausal subjects). Nocturnal cortisol secretion was increased in postmenopausal patients with depression, while a decrease was noted in postmenopausal controls. Sleep alterations typically associated with depression, namely a reduction in sleep continuity and slow wave sleep (SWS) and an increase in REM density, were prominent in post- but not in premenopausal patients. An inverse correlation was noted between the decline in SWS and sleep continuity and FSH secretion in patients with depression, suggesting a role of menopause for these sleep-endocrine alterations typically associated with major depression. In contrast, in premenopausal patients we noted primarily a shift in SWS and delta-EEG activity from the first to the second non-REM period, which was not related to age or hormone secretion. Though the relatively small number of subjects per group precludes a definitive conclusion, our data open up the possibility that the sleep-endocrine changes typically associated with major depression are most prominent in postmenopausal patients. Whether the predominant alteration of the distribution of SWS and delta EEG activity in younger patients with a first episode of major depression has a predictive value for the future course of the disease remains to be investigated.",E,E

Both the double-blind and the open-label phase lasted 2 months. ERPs were recorded from 19 EEG leads in a two-tone odd-ball paradigm in 49 patients aged between 46 and 67 yr with the diagnosis of insomnia (G 47.0) related to postmenopausal syndrome (N 95.1). Climodien reduced standard N1 and target P300 latencies as compared to placebo, while EV did not affect N1 latency but similarly reduced P300 latency. Climodien increased N1, P2 and P300 amplitudes dose-dependently, predominantly at frontal leads. Estrogen alone had only minor effects on ERP amplitudes. The shortening of standard N1 latency and enhancement of N1 and P2 amplitudes indicates a positive effect of Climodien on perceptual processing, most likely due to vigilance improvements also observed in EEG mapping. Concerning target P300, it seems that estradiol is responsible for the improvement in stimulus evaluation time, as reflected by the shortening of the peak latency, while dienogest seems to account for the improvement in cognitive information processing capacity, whereby 3 mg induced a more pronounced augmentation of P300 amplitudes than 2 mg. Based on the spatial distribution of this increase, it can be speculated that Climodien mainly affects the more frontally distributed P3a subcomponent, which is associated with attention and orientation. Furthermore, the observed changes in ERP-components are consistent with recent studies showing significant positive effects of hormone replacement therapy on cholinergic functions. Thus, Climodien seems to be of interest in preventing cognitive decline and treating cognitive disorders in postmenopausal women. Indeed, there is increasing evidence of beneficial effects of estrogen in dementia. Our present findings suggest that the estrogen effects may be augmented by dienogest.",E,E

MCI is important as it often precedes Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recognizing MCI may lead to preventive strategies that can delay the onset of AD. Many patients who transition into andropause report problems with their memory. There is strong evidence from basic sciences and epidemiological studies that both estrogens and androgens play a protective role in neurodegeneration. The evidence from small prospective clinical trials lends support to the role of hormones in improving cognitive function. The improvement in cognitive function with hormones is subtle and often not measurable on standard neuropsychological batteries. Patients have reported memory improvements in both declarative and procedural domains after being on hormonal replacement. Functional changes and vascular changes can be detected after hormonal replacement with more sophisticated imaging of the brain like positron emission tomography (PET) scans.

Sixty healthy women who had been postmenopausal for 1 to 5 years were recruited and divided into following 4 groups: group 1, percutaneous gel 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) 1.5 mg/d plus micronized progesterone (MP) 100 mg/d; group 2, percutaneous gel 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) 1.5 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2 mg/d; group 3, percutaneous gel 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) 0.75 mg/d plus micronized progesterone (MP) 100 mg/d; and group 4, percutaneous gel 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) 0.75 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2 mg/d. Estrogen and progestin were given continuously for 25 days per month. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using quantitative computed tomography (QCT) for trabecular bone of L2-5 and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for L2-4 and hip 5 times during the trial at baseline and at the 6-, 12-, 18-, 24- and 36-month visits.; Fifty-nine patients (98.3%, 59/60) stayed in the study for 1 year, 56 patients (93.3%, 56/60) for 2 years, and 51 (85%, 51/50) for 3 years. On average, menopausal symptoms were relieved by 80% after 6 months of treatment. By the 24th month, the mean increase in BMD ranged from 4.3% to 7.5% in trabecular bone; and by the 36th month, it ranged from 4.2% to 6.2% in L2-4 and 1.61% to 3.77% in the neck. There were significant difference after treatment (P < 0.05). Among the four groups, no significant difference (P > 0.05) was found in improvement of symptoms, levels of bone markers or BMD.; A daily dose of estradiol gel, either 0.75 mg or 1.5 mg, is effective in preventing early postmenopausal bone loss and relieving menopausal symptoms. After 3-year treatment, spinal BMD could increase steadily, so does hip BMD, especially in the first 2 years.",E,E

Review of efficacy and adverse effects of commonly prescribed vaginal estrogens is of great clinical relevance.; A Medline (1966-present) search was performed for randomized controlled trials involving vaginal estrogens. Reference lists of papers were reviewed for additional references.; Twenty-two references were randomized controlled trials of vaginal estrogens used by postmenopausal women with signs or symptoms of vaginal atrophy. Subject numbers ranged from 20 to 251. Duration ranged from 2 weeks to 1 year. Different preparations and schedules were used across the trials. All treatments alleviated signs and symptoms of atrophic vaginitis, regardless of whether objective signs of atrophy were required for study entry. Data for urinary symptoms was conflicting; the ring may prevent recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The trials with endometrial scrutiny were less than one year and had mixed results. Nonhormonal lubricant is effective in improving some atrophic signs and symptoms. All preparations were associated with vaginal irritation. Bleeding with vaginal estradiol tablets may be less than that with CEE cream. Vaginal tablets or rings were preferred over other preparations. There were no serious adverse events reported. There was occasional expulsion of estradiol ring in the setting of prior hysterectomy.; All preparations are effective in decreasing signs and symptoms of vaginal atrophy, but they differ slightly in their adverse event profiles. Long-term safety of the preparations is best established for estradiol tablets (1 year), but is lacking for all preparations.",E,E

This conclusion may not apply to women taking other estrogen and progestin formulations, as suggested by discrepancies in the findings of in vitro studies, epidemiological surveys and, mostly, in vivo studies of human breast epithelial cell proliferation showing opposite effects of HRT combining CEE plus MPA or estradiol plus progesterone. To evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated with the use of the latter combination, commonly prescribed in France, a cohort including 3175 postmenopausal women was followed for a mean of 8.9 years (28 367 woman-years). In total, 1739 (55%) of these women were users of one type of estrogen replacement with systemic effect during at least 12 months, any time after the menopause, and were classified as HRT users. Among them, 83% were receiving exclusively or mostly a combination of a transdermal estradiol gel and a progestin other than MPA. Some 105 cases of breast cancer occurred during the follow-up period, corresponding to a mean of 37 new cases per 10 000 women/year. Using multivariate analysis adjusted for the calendar period of treatment, date of birth and age at menopause, we were unable to detect an increase in the relative risk (RR) of breast cancer (RR 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65-1.5) in the HRT users. The RR of breast cancer per year of use of HRT was 1.005 (95% CI 0.97-1.05). These results do not justify early interruption of such a type of HRT, which is beneficial for quality of life, prevention of bone loss and cardiovascular risk profile, without the activation of coagulation and inflammatory protein synthesis measured in users of oral estrogens.",I,I

New low-dose estrogen-progestin regimens alleviate postmenopausal symptoms with a favorable side-effect profile; however, little is known of the impact of such regimens in women at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Hence, we have evaluated the effects of low-dose oral estrogen-progestin therapy on serum lipoprotein lipids, brachial artery reactivity and fibrinogen in hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women in direct comparison with the effects of pravastatin, a lipid-lowering agent known to reduce cardiovascular events in women.; In a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel trial, we studied the effects of continuous combined estrogen-progestin therapy (1 mg 17beta-estradiol with 500 micro g norethisterone acetate daily) or pravastatin (20 mg daily) in 72 postmenopausal women with fasting serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels greater than 124 mg/dl after an 8-week run-in diet, over a 24-week period. The primary end-point was percentage change in LDL cholesterol from baseline.; The intention-to-treat population comprised 65 women, mean age 59 +/- 6.3 years, and 29 in each group completed the trial. Diet alone reduced LDL cholesterol significantly in both treatment groups, in association with a reduction in weight during this period. Compared with respective baseline values, pravastatin decreased LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol to a greater extent than hormone therapy (p = 0.0001 and 0.003 for difference between treatments, respectively). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels decreased with hormone therapy, but did not change with pravastatin (p = 0.01). Lipoprotein(a) decreased significantly with hormone therapy only (-14%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -21 to -6%, p = 0.01 for difference between groups). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was impaired at baseline, and this increased with hormone therapy (absolute mean change in artery diameter as percentage units 2.07, 95% CI 0.57-3.57, p = 0.009) versus no change with pravastatin (0.19, 95% CI -1.1 to 1.5, p = 0.78), with a near-significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.058). A significant correlation between improved brachial artery FMD and reduction in LDL cholesterol was not observed. Fibrinogen decreased significantly in both treatment groups with no difference between treatments.; In postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women, pravastatin and hormone therapy exhibited divergent effects. The former lowered total and LDL cholesterol more effectively, whereas hormone therapy lowered lipoprotein(a) significantly and improved brachial artery endothelium-dependent dilatation, independent of the reduction in LDL cholesterol. The modest increase in brachial artery FMD seen is consistent with hypercholesterolemia compromising endothelial integrity, and suggests that the important effect of estrogen on the endothelial microenvironment may be attenuated in women with endothelial dysfunction.",E,E

In all groups, participants consumed a daily supplement containing 25 g of soy protein and were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) isoflavone extracted soy protein (control), (b) soy protein with a medium dose of isoflavones (42 mg/day), or (c) soy protein with a higher dose of isoflavones (58 mg/day). The primary outcome measure in this trial was change in reported vasomotor symptoms.; A reduction in the number and severity of vasomotor symptoms was observed in all three treatment groups. No significant differences in the number and severity of vasomotor symptoms were observed among the high isoflavone, middle isoflavone, or control groups. The lack of a between-treatment group effect was observed even after stratified by number of baseline symptoms and use of traditional hormone replacement therapy.; These data suggest that soy protein containing 42 or 58 mg of isoflavones is no more effective than isoflavone-extracted soy protein for improving the number and severity of vasomotor symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women.",E,E

Sixty-five osteopenic women with anorexia nervosa were randomized to rhIGF-I (30 micro g/kg sc twice daily) alone (n = 15), daily ethinyl estradiol (Ovcon 35) with rhIGF-I (n = 15), estradiol and placebo (n = 15), or placebo (n = 14) for 9 months. Subjects were 25.6 +/- 0.8 yr of age, low weight (body mass index 16.6 +/- 0.2 kg/m(2)) and osteopenic (T scores -2.06 +/- 0.09 for spine and -1.76 +/- 0.13 for hip). IGFBP-3 correlated with total hip bone density (r = 0.47, P = 0.0002) and was a significant predictor of hip bone density (P = 0.010) independent of IGF-I and body mass index in a multivariate regression model. During therapy, IGFBP-2 increased by 48 +/- 19 ng/ml in response to rhIGF-I and decreased by -38 +/- 22 ng/ml in response to placebo (P = 0.011). IGFBP-3 decreased (-895 +/- 120 ng/ml) in response to rhIGF-I but showed a minimal change (-53 +/- 99 ng/ml) in response to placebo (P < 0.0001). In contrast, no significant effect of estrogen was seen on IGF-I, IGFBP-2 or IGFBP-3. Among patients receiving rhIGF-I, the change in IGFBP-2 was inversely associated with the change in total hip bone density (R = -0.47, P = 0.013). In conclusion, our data suggest that chronic rhIGF-I administration increases IGF-I and IGFBP-2 and decreases IGFBP-3 in women with anorexia nervosa. IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 may be important determinants of bone density in this population.",E,E

In addition, the effects of interview stress and circadian hormone secretion need to be checked. In a pilot study on the overall sexual capacity of aging men, 48 randomly selected, healthy, heterosexual, cohabiting men aged 50-80 years, from Mannheim, Germany, and 50 from the State College, Pennsylvania, USA, were administered a standardized interview covering medical biography, present and previous life and work, marriage and emotional status. Two saliva samples were collected from each subject for measurement of testosterone, cortisol, estradiol and DHEA-S levels before and after the interview, and each subject completed a confidential self-administered questionnaire on intercourse, masturbation, orgasm, fantasies, libido and arousal. Questionnaires, hormone measurement techniques and the survey protocol had been extensively pretested. Prior to the pilot study, the kits for measuring testosterone and DHEA-S in saliva were checked for comparative validity against established measuring techniques in serum in 31 cases for testosterone and in 24 different cases for DHEA-S. These 55 cases underwent clinical diagnosis and were not otherwise involved in this study. The cases had been referred to the Andrology Unit of the University Hospital, Marburg, for reasons unrelated to this study. Given the biological differences for both steroids between their presence in blood and in saliva, a perfect correspondence between the two values was not expected and was not observed. The correlations obtained, however, support the assumption that all statistical relationships between testosterone and DHEA-S values in serum and clinical, as well as behavioral, variables reported to date may be replicated for testosterone and DHEA-S values in saliva.",E,E

Prior to this study, no randomized controlled trials have evaluated whether minimizing these hormonal changes pharmacologically can prevent headache.; Twenty-one women with regular menstrual cycles and a diagnosis of migraine headache were enrolled. After a 2.5-month placebo run-in phase, all patients received a subcutaneous goserelin implant (a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist) to induce a medical oophorectomy. One month later, while continuing goserelin, participants were randomized to receive a transdermal patch containing 100 microg of estradiol-17beta (gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist/estradiol group, n = 9) or a placebo patch (gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist/placebo group, n = 12) during a 2-month treatment phase. The primary outcome measure was the headache index, which was defined as the mean of pain severity ratings (0 to 10 scale) recorded three times per day by daily diary. Secondary outcome measures included headache disability, headache severity, headache frequency, and the percentage of headaches with a pain severity rating of 7 or greater.; The headache index was significantly lower during the treatment period in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist/estradiol group than in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist/placebo group (P =.025).

Irritability, tension, fatigue, depression, breast tenderness and bloating are among the most common premenstrual symptoms. Approximately 5-10% of women of childbearing age experience premenstrual symptoms to a degree that disrupts their functioning in the home or workplace and that meet criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Serotonergic antidepressants are clearly effective for PMDD, with about 60% of subjects responding to this treatment in controlled studies. Oral contraceptives are commonly used to treat premenstrual symptoms but are an understudied intervention with no information on their efficacy for PMDD). The recent introduction of an oral contraceptive (Yasmin, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany), containing low-dose ethinylestradiol (EE) combined with a new progestogen, drospirenone (DRSP), may offer clinical efficacy for PMDD as a result of the unique pharmacological profile of this progestogen, which is a spirolactone derivative with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity. A randomized, placebo-controlled study of DRSP/EE in women with PMDD found a consistently greater reduction of symptoms-from baseline for all 22 premenstrual symptoms assessed (using the Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences, COPE) and for the four statistically derived symptom factors in the group taking DRSP/EE compared to the placebo group. For appetite, acne and food craving (factor 3), the difference between the DRSP/EE group and the placebo group was statistically significant (p = 0.027). These preliminary results suggest the beneficial effect of DRSP/EE on PMDD and offer an alternative class of medication that also provides the range of benefits of oral contraception for women with PMDD.",E,E

An additional antiresorptive treatment was continued with risedronate in 50% of these patients (estrogen, raloxifene, or calcitonin). Risedronate 30 mg was taken once weekly with vitamin D 400 iu daily and 1200 mg of calcium daily. Patient age ranged from 46 to 86 yr. Baseline and followup BMD data were available in 36 patients. Of the 32 patients with baseline GI symptoms or previous intolerance of a bisphosphonate, 1 developed GI symptoms. In those patients with baseline and follow-up BMD results (n = 36), BMD increased 1.9% (p = 0.02) at the trochanter and 2.1% (p = 0.001) at the total hip. In conclusion 30 mg of risedronate once weekly increased BMD at the trochanter and total hip (p < 0.05). This dosage was well tolerated with a low incidence of GI side effects.",E,E

We compared the effects of several weeks of controlled high and low meat diets on body calcium retention, using sensitive radiotracer and whole body scintillation counting methodology. Healthy postmenopausal women (n = 15) consumed diets with similar calcium content (approximately 600 mg), but either low or high in meat (12 vs. 20% of energy as protein) for 8 wk each, in a randomized crossover design. After 4 wk of equilibration of each diet, calcium retention was measured by extrinsically labeling the 2-d menu with (47)Ca, followed by whole body scintillation counting for 28 d. Urinary and blood indicators of bone metabolism were also determined for each diet. Calcium retention was not different during the high and low meat dietary periods (d 28, mean +/- pooled SD: 17.1 and 15.6%, +/-0.6%, respectively; P = 0.09). An initially higher renal acid excretion in subjects consuming the high meat compared with the low meat diet decreased significantly with time. The diets did not affect urinary calcium loss or indicators of bone metabolism. In conclusion, under controlled conditions, a high meat compared with a low meat diet for 8 wk did not affect calcium retention or biomarkers of bone metabolism in healthy postmenopausal women. Calcium retention is not reduced when subjects consume a high protein diet from common dietary sources such as meat.",E,E

The paper reports data on the long-term adverse effects of combined equine estrogen-progestin hormone replacement therapy, taken for 5 years. (2) On average, a yearly excess of 19 severe adverse events per 10 000 women occurred in the estrogen-progestin group. Relative to the placebo group, there were an extra 8 pulmonary embolisms, 7 coronary events, 8 strokes and 8 cases of invasive breast cancer. In contrast, there were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures in the active treatment group. (3) The differences in the frequency of coronary events and venous thromboembolism emerged after the first year of treatment, while the curves for stroke and breast cancer diverged after the second and fifth years, respectively. (4) The overall mortality rate did not differ between the two groups. (5) A placebo-controlled trial of the same hormone combination (HERS trial), given for 4.1 years as secondary prophylaxis against coronary heart disease was published in 1998. The drug was ineffective during the trial, and during unblinded post-trial follow-up of 2 321 women for an average of 2.7 years (HERS II study). (6) The estrogen-progestin combination used in these trials did not reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (in primary or secondary prophylaxis) or the risk of stroke. On the contrary, both risks increased. (7) The increased incidence of deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism associated with estrogen-progestin replacement therapy was confirmed in these trials, even among women with no relevant history. (8) The WHI trial also confirmed the increased risk of breast cancer in women on hormone replacement therapy, but did not study its impact on outcome or mortality. (9) The WHI trial confirmed the beneficial impact of estrogen-progestin combination therapy on the risk of osteoporotic fracture. An average of 5 hip fractures were avoided each year per 10 000 women treated (10 versus 15 observed cases per 10 000 women per year), together with 6 symptomatic vertebral fractures (9 versus 15 cases) and 44 osteoporotic fractures (147 versus 191 cases). It is not known whether the benefit observed at the end of the trial persisted after the end of treatment. (10) In practice, the decision to prescribe hormone replacement therapy, and the optimal duration of treatment, must be weighed up according to each individual's risk factors. And the decision to treat or not to treat must be regularly re-assessed. Women must be informed of the potential risks and benefits, and must be monitored. They should also be advised not to use less well assessed treatments such as phytoestrogens, DHEA and tibolone. (11) Health authorities, especially in Europe, must organise comparative trials to assess the benefits and risks of other hormone combinations used by perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.",E,E

It is not known whether this effect is also present in European populations and whether it is caused by lower peak bone mass or accelerated postmenopausal bone loss. MTHFR genotyping was done in 1748 healthy postmenopausal Danish women participating in a prospective study of risk factors for osteoporosis. At the time of enrollment, 3-24 months after last menstrual period, the less prevalent genotype (TT, 8.7% of the population) was associated with significantly lower BMD at the femoral neck (ANOVA, p < 0.05), total hip (p < 0.01), and spine (p < 0.05 adjusted for lifestyle covariates, p = 0.06 without adjustment). The mean difference was between 0.1 and 0.3 SD, depending on measurement site. MTHFR genotype added significantly to prediction of BMD by weight and age. Fracture incidence was increased more than 2-fold in subjects with the TT genotype (risk ratio [RR], 2.6; 95% CI 1.2-5.6). This remained significant when the Cox analysis was controlled for BMD (RR, 2.4; 95% CI 1.1-5.2). No differences in serum osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and 25-OH-vitamin D were found between genotypes. The response to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) did not differ, but the association of the TT genotype with reduced BMD was maintained at the total hip after 5 years of HRT. The MTHFR TT genotype is associated with low BMD and increased fracture incidence in early postmenopausal women.",E,E

Additionally, we studied whether the gene polymorphisms affect circulating testosterone (T), estradiol (E(2)), and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations. The polymorphic CAG repeat of the AR gene, the TTTA repeat of the human aromatase gene, and the PvuII site of the ERalpha gene were analyzed. BMDs of the lumbar spine (L2-L4), femoral neck, and total proximal femur were measured with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In the exercise group, the subjects with the ERalpha gene PP or Pp genotypes showed an increase (+6.5 and +5.1%, respectively) in lumbar spine BMDs (P = 0.007; repeated measures ANOVA) during intervention, while there was no change in the subjects with the pp genotype. The long TTTA repeat (TTTA(9-12)) in aromatase gene was associated with greater height (P = 0.026) and lower BMI (P = 0.029) values than the short TTTA repeat (TTTA(6-8)). With regard to the AR gene, no statistically significant differences in bone properties were found between the genotypes. There were no significant associations of any analyzed polymorphic sites with the serum sex steroid hormone concentrations in the exercise or reference group. In conclusion, the Finnish middle-aged men with ERalpha PP or Pp genotypes appear to have increased BMD values in the lumbar spine. This increase may reflect a predisposition to age-related degenerative changes in the spine. In addition, the AR CAG repeat and aromatase TTTA repeat do not modify the effect of regular aerobic exercise on BMD.",E,E

Methods to preserve bone density in these women need to be explored. This multicenter, international, randomized, blinded, 12-month study was conducted to assess the effect of alendronate sodium on bone density in women who had recently discontinued HRT.; The 144 postmenopausal women included in the study were diagnosed as having low bone mineral density (BMD) and had recently discontinued HRT. They were randomized to receive either a daily dose of 10 mg of alendronate sodium or matching placebo. The main outcome measures were spine, hip, and total body BMD; biochemical markers of bone turnover; and tolerability.; Alendronate treatment was associated with a 2.3% mean increase (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7%-3.0%) in spine BMD compared with a mean loss of 3.2% (95% CI, - 4.6% to - 1.7%) in patients receiving placebo, for a difference of 5.5% (95% CI, 4.2%-6.8%) between alendronate and placebo. Greater hip and total body BMD preservation was also observed with alendronate use. Bone turnover decreased significantly with alendronate (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels decreased by 20% and urinary N-telopeptide/creatinine ratio by 47%), but increased in the placebo group (by 18% and 36%, respectively). Alendronate was well tolerated, with no increase in adverse events compared with placebo.; A high rate of bone loss was observed in the first 12 to 15 months after discontinuation of HRT in postmenopausal women with low BMD. Treatment with alendronate increased or maintained both spine and hip BMD and prevented the increase in bone resorption seen with withdrawal of HRT in this population.",E,E
12698204,Strontium ranelate: a new paradigm in the treatment of osteoporosis.,"Animals; Biological Availability; Bone and Bones; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Humans; Male; Organometallic Compounds; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Thiophenes; Tissue Distribution","Reginster, J-Y; Deroisy, R; Jupsin, I","Not one of the currently available medications has, so far, unequivocally demonstrated its ability to fully prevent the occurrence of new vertebral or peripheral osteoporotic fractures once osteoporosis is established. Therefore, several new therapies are currently under development to optimize the risk/benefit ratio of osteoporosis treatment. Strontium ranelate is composed of an organic moiety (ranelic acid) and of two atoms of stable nonradioactive strontium. In vitro, strontium ranelate increases collagen and noncollagenic proteins synthesis by mature osteoblast enriched cells. The effects of strontium ranelate on bone formation were confirmed as strontium ranelate enhanced pre-osteoblastic cell replication. The stimulation by strontium ranelate of the replication of osteoprogenitor cell and collagen, as well as noncollagenic protein synthesis in osteoblasts, provides substantial evidence to categorize strontium ranelate as a bone-forming agent. In the isolated rat osteoclast assay, a pre-incubation of bone slices with strontium ranelate induced a dose- dependent inhibition of the bone resorbing activity of treated rat osteoclast. Strontium ranelate also dose-dependently inhibited, in a chicken bone marrow culture, the expression of both carbonic anhydrase II and the alpha-subunit of the vitronectin receptor. These effects showing that strontium ranelate significantly affects bone resorption due to a direct and/or matrix-mediated inhibition of osteoclast activity and also inhibits osteoclasts differentiation, are compatible with the profile of an anti-resorptive drug. In normal rats, administration of strontium ranelate induces an improvement in the mechanical properties of the humerus and/or the lumbar vertebra associated with a commensurate increase in bone dimension, shaft and volume. Strontium ranelate was administered in 160 early postmenopausal women, in a 24-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective randomized study. Daily oral dose of 125 mg, 500 mg and 1 g of strontium ranelate were compared with a placebo. At the conclusion of the study, the percent variation of lumbar-adjusted bone mineral density from baseline was significantly different in the group receiving 1 g/day of strontium ranelate compared with placebo (+1.41% vs. -0.98%, respectively). Increase in total hip and neck bone mineral density averages, respectively, 3.2% and 2.5%. Strontium ranelate does not induce any significant adverse reaction compared with those observed in women receiving a placebo for the same duration. In a phase II study, the effect of strontium ranelate in postmenopausal women with vertebral osteoporotic fractures was assessed during a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Doses of 500 mg, 1 g and 2 g daily of strontium ranelate or placebo were given to 353 Caucasian women with prevalent osteoporosis. At the conclusion of this 2-year study, the annual increase in lumbar-adjusted bone mineral density of the group receiving 2 g of strontium ranelate was + 2.97%. This result was significantly different compared with placebo. A significant increase in bone alkaline phosphatase and, over a 6-month period, a significant decrease in urinary-pyridium crosslinks (NTX) were evidenced. During the second year of treatment, the dose of 2 g was associated with a 44% reduction in the number of patients experiencing a new vertebral deformity. Bone histomorphometry showed no mineralization defects. The same percentage of withdrawals following an adverse effect was observed for patients receiving placebo and for those receiving 2 g of strontium ranelate. The compound was further investigated in a large phase III program that included two extensive trials for the treatment of severe osteoporosis, one assessing the effects of strontium ranelate on the risk of vertebral fractures (SOTI) and one evaluating its effects on peripheral (nonspinal) fractures (TROPOS). The primary analysis of the SOTI study, evaluating the effect of 2 g of strontium ranelate on vertebral fracture rates, revealed a 41% reduction in the relative risk of expein the relative risk of experiencing a first new vertebral fracture with strontium ranelate, throughout the 3-year study, compared with placebo. The TROPOS study, showed a significant (p = 0.05) reduction in the relative risk of experiencing a first non-vertebral fracture in the group treated with strontium ranelate throughout the 3-year study compared with placebo in the intention-to-treat population. A 41% reduction in the relative risk of experiencing a hip fracture was demonstrated in the per protocol population. All these results imply that strontium ranelate is a new, effective and safe treatment for vertebral and nonvertebral osteoporosis, with a unique mode of action.",E,E

Because CRP is synthesized in the liver, we hypothesized that estrogen-induced CRP elevation is related to first-pass hepatic metabolism.; In 21 postmenopausal women, we conducted a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study to compare the effects of transdermal versus oral ET on CRP and inflammatory cytokines. We measured CRP, interleukin (IL)-1-beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha before and after eight weeks of transdermal estradiol (E(2)) (100 microg/day), oral conjugated estrogen (CEE) (0.625 mg/day), or placebo. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hepatic-derived anabolic peptide, was also measured.; Transdermal E(2) had no effect on CRP or IGF-1 levels. In contrast, eight weeks of oral conjugated estrogens caused a more than twofold increase in CRP and a significant reduction in IGF-1 (p < 0.01) in the same women. The magnitude of increase in CRP was inversely correlated to the decrease in IGF-1 (r = -0.49, p = 0.008). Neither transdermal E(2) nor oral CEE had any effects on the plasma concentrations of cytokines that promote CRP synthesis.; In postmenopausal women, oral but not transdermal ET increased CRP by a first-pass hepatic effect. An increase in CRP levels is accompanied by a reduction in IGF-1, an anti-inflammatory growth factor. Because CRP is a powerful predictor of an adverse prognosis in otherwise healthy postmenopausal women, the route of administration may be an important consideration in minimizing the adverse effects of ET on cardiovascular outcomes.",E,E

History of premenstrual syndrome, type of progestin, and dose of progestin have thus far been shown to influence the progestin-induced adverse mood symptoms during HRT. The aim of this study was to compare adverse mood effects of two different doses of estradiol, in combination with a progestin, during postmenopausal HRT. Twenty-eight perimenopausal women were included in this randomized, double-blind, crossover study comparing 2- or 3-mg continuous estradiol, with an addition of 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate on d 17-28 during each treatment cycle. The main outcome measures were mood and physical symptoms kept on a daily rating scale. Together with the progestin, the higher dose of estrogen caused significantly more negative mood symptoms than the lower dose. Tension, irritability, and depressed mood were all significantly augmented during the progestin phase of cycles with 3 mg estradiol (P < 0.001). Physical symptoms also increased during the progestin phase of 3-mg estradiol cycles (P < 0.001), whereas positive mood symptoms were less affected. The only positive mood that changed with estrogen dose was friendliness, which decreased during the progestin phase of high estradiol cycles compared with cycles with lower estradiol (P < 0.05). Our conclusion is that an increase of the estrogen dose accentuates negative mood and physical symptoms during the progestin phase of sequential hormonal therapy.",E,E

There is a clear causal relationship between estrogen deficiency and osteoporosis. Postmenopausal status or estrogen-deficiency at any age significantly increases a patient's risk for osteoporosis and subsequent fragility fractures. Estrogen, in various formulations, is currently FDA-indicated for the prevention of osteoporosis. However, estrogen is not FDA-approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. Recent randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that estrogen significantly reduces fractures among osteoporotic postmenopausal women. Most postmenopausal women choose to use estrogen for relief of vasomotor symptoms and urogenital atrophy. HRT should be limited to osteoporosis prevention in women with significant ongoing vasomotor symptoms who are not at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. An annual, individualized, risk/benefit reassessment should be performed on these patients. Further research is needed to assess the potential risks and benefits of various formulations, combinations, doses, and delivery routes of estrogen for postmenopausal women.",E,E

There was no significant difference between the two treatments in either time to 1 mm ST-segment depression or total exercise time. A period effect was apparent for total exercise time (P = 0.05) but not for time to ST-segment depression.; Acute parenteral oestrogen therapy did not increase total exercise time or time to the onset of electrocardiographic changes of ischaemia in men with chronic stable coronary artery disease. These findings contrast the favourable effects of oestrogen in women in comparable studies and indicate a sex specificity for the acute cardiovascular effects of oestrogen.",E,E

The trial was conducted at a single academic US medical center from January 1996 to May 2001.; Participants were randomly assigned in a 2 x 2 factorial design to receive hormone replacement (conjugated equine estrogen, 0.625 mg/d, with or without medroxyprogesterone, 2.5 mg/d) and alendronate, 10 mg daily, both agents, or neither. All participants received calcium and vitamin D supplements.; Annualized change in bone mineral density of the hip and spine and occurrence of adverse events.; Bone mineral density at 3 years was significantly greater at all femoral and vertebral sites in women treated with combination therapy than with monotherapy, with mean (SD) increases of 5.9% (3.8) at the total hip, 10.4% (5.4) at the posteroanterior lumbar spine, and 11.8% (6.8) at the lateral lumbar spine. Mean (SD) increases in bone mass at the hip in women treated with alendronate alone were significantly greater than in those treated with hormone replacement therapy alone (4.2% [3.8] vs 3.0% [4.9]; P<.05, respectively), and alendronate resulted in more responders to therapy. All therapies were well tolerated and participant retention was 90% at 3 years.; Combination therapy with hormone replacement and alendronate was efficacious and well tolerated in this cohort. Alendronate was superior to hormone replacement, and combination therapy was superior to either therapy alone. Combination therapy may represent an option for women with more severe disease or for those who have failed to achieve an adequate response to monotherapy.",E,E

We review observational and randomized trials to determine whether HRT might protect against cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired and demented women. We also address issues of clinical relevance, including duration and type of treatment and patient characteristics, including type of menopause (surgical versus natural), age, education and menopausal symptoms. Differences in participant characteristics and testing methods limit the ability to draw conclusions across randomized studies of HRT in non-demented women. The available evidence suggests no detrimental effect of HRT on cognitive function and inconsistent benefits on verbal memory and reasoning, frontal functions and speeded attention. Meta-analyses of observational trials suggest that HRT protects against the development of AD, but randomized trials indicate no long-lasting benefit in patients with AD. Evidence is insufficient to recommend HRT to maintain cognitive function.",E,E

In the oldest old also loss of muscle strength resulting in frailty becomes the limiting factor for an individual's chances of living an independent life until death. Two hormonal changes mark the aging process in man. In women an acute drop in estrogen production by the ovaries around the age of 50 initiates a symptom complex called menopause. In men a more subtle drop of testosterone bioactivity from 40 yrs onwards might be accompanied by more difficulty to recognize symptomatology (andropause). Hormone replacement strategies in elderly women and males with estrogens or androgens, respectively, has some clear advantages, but is currently controversial, because of the occurrence of adverse effects.",E,E

General linear models were used to describe demographic differences among scores. Factor analysis was used to characterize the correlational structure of exam subscales.The distribution of 3MS scores at baseline was compressed in WHIMS compared to population-based data. Mean 3MS scores (overall 95.1) tended to decrease with age and increase with education, however these associations varied among ethnic groups (p< 0.0001) even after adjustment for health, physical disability and occupation attainment. Four factors accounted for 37% of the total variance. Each varied with education and ethnicity; the two most prominent factors also varied with age.

A battery of cognitive tests assessing verbal and spatial memory, language, and attention was administered at baseline (prior to medication) and again at days 90 and 180 of treatment for men receiving T gel and at baseline and days 30 and 90 of treatment for men receiving DHT gel. For men receiving T gel, circulating total T and estradiol (E(2)) were significantly raised compared with baseline, and a significant improvement in verbal memory was observed. For men receiving DHT gel, serum DHT levels increased and T levels decreased significantly compared with baseline, and a significant improvement in spatial memory was observed. The results suggest that beneficial changes in cognition can occur in hypogonadal men using T replacement levels and DHT treatment, and these changes in cognition can be reliably measured during a relative steady-state dose level. Further, our results suggest that aromatization of T to E(2) may regulate verbal memory in men, whereas nonaromatizable androgens may regulate spatial memory.",E,E

Treatment of the underlying intestinal disorder seems to be most important to normalise altered bone metabolism and to prevent osteoporosis in patients with coeliac disease. In patients with osteoporosis associated with Crohn's disease, various treatment strategies (such as vitamin D, sodium fluoride, bisphosphonates) are discussed. In contrast to postmenopausal osteoporosis, interventional studies in secondary osteoporosis are often limited by the small study population and data about the efficacy of any treatment in prevention of fractures are therefore lacking.

The unfavorable risk/benefit profile of HRT, however, strongly limits its use for prevention of osteoporosis, given that there are other medications that have demonstrated fracture efficacy.",E,E
12916293,Bisphosphonate treatment of osteoporosis.,Bone Density; Clinical Trials as Topic; Diphosphonates; Humans; Osteoporosis,"Watts, Nelson B","Bisphosphonates represent the agents of choice for most patients with osteoporosis. They are the best studied of all agents for the prevention of bone loss and reduction in fractures. They increase BMD, primarily at the lumbar spine, but also at the proximal femur. In patients who have established osteoporosis, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of vertebral fractures, and are the only agents in prospective trials to reduce the risk of hip fractures and other nonvertebral fractures. Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of fracture quickly. The risk of radiographic vertebral deformities is reduced after 1 year of treatment with risedronate [68]. The risk of clinical vertebral fractures is reduced after 1 year of treatment with alendronate [69] and just 6 months' treatment with risedronate [157]. The antifracture effect of risedronate has been shown to continue through 5 years of treatment [158]. Alendronate and risedronate are approved by the FDA for prevention of bone loss in recently menopausal women, for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and for prevention (risedronate) and treatment (alendronate and risedronate) of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Alendronate is also approved for treatment of osteoporosis in men. Other bisphosphonates (etidronate for oral use, pamidronate and zoledronate for intravenous infusion) are also available and can be used off label for patients who cannot tolerate approved agents. Although bisphosphonates combined with estrogen or raloxifene produce greater gains in bone mass compared with single-agent treatment, the use of two antiresorptive agents in combination cannot be recommended because the benefit on fracture risk has not been demonstrated and because of increased cost and side effects.",E,E
12916294,The anabolic effects of parathyroid hormone therapy.,"Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Hormone Replacement Therapy; Humans; Male; Osteoporosis; Parathyroid Hormone","Rubin, Mishaela R; Bilezikian, John P","PTH represents an important new advance in the therapy of osteoporosis. As an anabolic agent, its potential might be substantially greater than that of antiresorptive agents. Clear evidence in human trials now documents the ability of PTH to stimulate cancellous bone formation and to reduce fractures. Because antiresorptive agents and PTH work by distinct mechanisms of action, it is possible that the combination of these agents could be significantly more potent than either agent alone. There are other unanswered questions about PTH. More studies are needed to document an anabolic effect on cortical bone. In addition, more large-scale studies are needed to further determine the reduction in nonvertebral fractures with PTH, especially at the hip. More information is also required to determine the possible need for antiresorptive therapy after PTH. Protocols to consider PTH as an intermittent recycling therapy would be of interest. In the future, PTH is likely to be modified for easier and more targeted delivery. Oral or transdermal delivery systems may become available. Recently, Gowen et al [78] have described an oral calcilytic molecule that antagonizes the parathyroid cell calcium receptor, thus stimulating the endogenous release of PTH. This approach could represent a novel endogenous delivery system for intermittent PTH administration. Ultimately, when the anabolic and catabolic mechanisms of PTH can be clearly distinguished, both mechanistically and in molecular terms, it may be possible to develop PTH analogs that are more purely anabolic.",E,E

It leads to fractures that deeply affect the patients' quality of life. Osteoporosis is recognised as a leading factor in healthcare cost worldwide. For years, experts have recommended hormone replacement therapy (HRT), consisting of oestrogen with or without progestin, as the first-line therapy to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women. Recently published randomised, controlled trials and well-designed meta-analyses confirm that HRT has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages include prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. The disadvantages are the resulting adverse effects such as coronary artery disease, stroke, thromboembolic events, breast cancer and cholecystitis. In the light of these findings, medical associations recommend against the routine use of oestrogen and progestin for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women. HRT, administered for the prevention of fractures in all young postmenopausal women, would have an additional cost/year of life gained that is too expensive. However, this strategy seems to be cost-effective when young postmenopausal women at high risk for fractures are selected. Even if this strategy seems attractive, the adverse effects of HRT are not acceptable. This situation implies that other treatments must be found to prevent or treat osteoporosis. Among them, calcium and vitamin D were shown to be cost-saving in osteoporosis and even costs-effective in osteopoenia in young postmenopausal women.",E,E

Several transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) releasing estrogens, progestogens and androgens from patches attached to the skin are currently in clinical use. For women, transdermal systems have been developed for hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) and recently for contraception. HRT with patches releasing only estradiol (E2) should be supplemented with a progestogen to protect the endometrium. Patches simultaneously releasing both E2 and a progestogen are also available. Combined regimens are either continuous or sequential. In the latter, estrogen-only patches are applied for 14 days, followed by 14-day application of patches releasing both hormones. Transdermal HRT successfully treats menopausal symptoms and has a bone-sparing effect. Transdermal contraceptive patches deliver ethinyl E2 in combination with the progestogen norelgestromin. This system provides an effective contraceptive and acceptable bleeding pattern not different from that of oral contraceptives. The types of adverse events experienced are approximately the same as with oral contraceptives. Reactions at the application site cause about 3% women to discontinue the use of patches. Transdermal systems also have been designed to supplement testosterone in hypogonadal men. Testosterone released from patches produces positive effects on mood and sexual behavior and significantly increases bone mass. Men using testosterone patches have to be regularly monitored for an increase in prostate volume and changes in prostate-specific antigen. Reproductive steroids delivered by the skin avoid first-pass liver metabolism, typical of oral dosing; consequently, the liver tissue is affected to a lesser degree. Other advantages include rapid onset and termination of action, noninvasive self-administration and attainment of therapeutic hormone levels with low daily doses. Reduced frequency of dosing has the potential to improve patient compliance. While compliance is important for any hormone, it is particularly important for contraceptive purposes. Like oral delivery of sex steroids, percutaneous absorption is characterized by intra- and interindividual variability. New technologies under development, combining electronics and low-frequency ultrasound, have the potential to provide precise dosing as well as drug delivery ""on demand.""",E,E

The aim of this trial, in which hirsutism was the primary end point, was to compare the efficacy of the oral antihyperglycemic medication metformin with that of an established treatment, combined ethinyl estradiol and cyproterone acetate. Patients (n = 52) were randomized to receive either metformin (500 mg, three times daily) or Dianette (ethinyl estradiol, 35 micro g; cyproterone acetate, 2 mg) treatment for 12 months, with assessments before treatment, at 6 months, and at 12 months. Both objective and subjective methods of evaluating hirsutism were used, and in addition, patient perceptions were examined. The results show that metformin is potentially an effective treatment for moderate to severe hirsutism in women with PCOS. They also suggest that in some respects (Ferriman-Gallwey score and patient self-assessment), it is more efficacious than the standard treatment (Dianette). The objective evaluation of hair diameter reduction showed that both treatments were moderately effective at multiple anatomical sites. Dianette treatment was responsible for profound suppression of androgen activity, in contrast to metformin, which induced negligible change. However, metformin did reduce markers of insulin resistance. The data suggest that hirsutism may be effectively treated by reducing hyperinsulinemia.",E,E

In contrast, concurrent progestin therapy may oppose this beneficial effect. We studied the effect of long-term estrogen HRT and combined HRT on vasomotor function and on plasma nitrate, which reflects the amount of NO in the circulation. As lipid peroxidation affects NO production and impairs endothelial function, we also measured the amount of the in vivo lipid peroxidation marker urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2 alpha). The study group comprised 15 women receiving estradiol valerate HRT (mean age, 56 yr; treatment duration, 10.5 yr) and 15 women receiving combined HRT with estradiol valerate and levonorgestrel (mean age, 58 yr; treatment duration, 11.3 yr). The peak flow velocity (PFV) and pulsatility index of the common carotid and internal carotid artery and the abdominal aorta were measured by ultrasonography after long-term HRT (baseline), after a 4-wk pause and again 3 wk after reintroducing HRT. A statistically significant interaction between the groups and time points was observed in the PFV of the internal carotid artery (P = 0.011). In women taking estradiol valerate, the PFV values decreased significantly after withdrawal of HRT (P = 0.007) and increased again to the baseline level after reintroduction of therapy (P < 0.001). In women receiving combined HRT, the PFV remained stable over all study periods. At baseline, the PFV of women taking estradiol valerate correlated with the plasma nitrate concentration in the common carotid artery (r = 0.646; P = 0.009) and in the abdominal aorta (r = 0.579; P = 0.024). For pulsatility index and urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2 alpha) excretion, there were no significant differences between the groups. Our results suggest that the favorable effects of long-term estrogen treatment on blood flow are at least partly mediated through NO. The addition of levonorgestrel to the treatment regimen appears to abolish this effect.",E,E

As the leading cause of disability and second cause of dementia, primary prevention should be the main way to fight the disease, since therapy is not efficient enough. Several observations pointed to estrogen as a protective agent that may reduce stroke risk, however, studies have shown conflicting data. There is no strong evidence that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases stroke risk. Several studies have shown that HRT may reduce the risk of fatal stroke. Conflicting results have been found for Alzheimer's disease and HRT as well. An association between higher serum concentration of estradiol and decreased risk of cognitive decline has been found in some studies, supporting the hypothesis that estrogen concentration may play a significant role in brain protection. Having in mind results of recent randomized trials, it is suggested that HRT should not be recommended on general basis for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases or for primary prevention of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Osteoporosis, cognitive decline and climacteric symptoms that are likely to impact on quality of life, speak in favor for recommendation of HRT use. On the other side, family history of breast carcinoma, mastopathy, thromboembolism, in certain cases gallbladder disease, will discourage the commencement of HRT. Respecting the patient's preferences and having benefits and risks in mind as well as science advisory statements, individual counseling regarding HRT should be the leading concept in the healthcare of postmenopausal women.",E,E

However, compliance with HRT was reported to be low despite the benefits of HRT. In addition, results of several recent large-scale randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that protection from cardiovascular disease is not an indication for treatment with estrogen and progestin in postmenopausal women. Recent studies have demonstrated that low-dose HRT is safe and effective for prevention of postmenopausal bone loss. Low-dose HRT has also been shown to be effective for reducing the number and severity of hot flashes, improving vaginal atrophy, and inducing favorable changes in lipids, lipoproteins and hemostatic factors. Moreover, low-dose regimens of CEE (conjugated equine estrogen) and MPA (medroxyprogesterone acetate) result in higher rates of amenorrhea and endometrial protection compared with the conventional dose of HRT. Low-dose HRT may improve the compliance rate and may be more effective than conventional-dose HRT for reducing the risk of breast cancer. On the other hand, it has been shown that transdermal estrogen treatment reduces the incidence and severity of hot flashes and that long-term treatment with transdermally administered estrogen is effective for protection against osteoporosis. Transdermal administration of estrogen is recommended in postmenopausal women with hypertriglycemia because this treatment has little effect on lipid metabolism. The serum estradiol level was reported to be closely related to estrogenic effects on various tissues. An HRT regimen should be based on the needs of each patient. Serum estradiol levels in women should be maintained at appropriate levels for benefits and not be excessively high in order to prevent side effects. Selection of the most appropriate regimen of HRT (dose, route of administration and schedule) for the needs of the individual are important factors to increase the rate of continuation with HRT.",E,E

Of those randomized to observation, one resumed ovulating, one had partial return of ovarian function, and six did not recover. Thus, CBT resulted in a higher rate of ovarian activity (87.5%) than did observation (25.0%), chi(2) = 7.14.; A cognitive behavioral intervention designed to minimize problematic attitudes linked to hypothalamic allostasis was more likely to result in resumption of ovarian activity than observation. The prompt ovarian response to CBT suggests that a tailored behavioral intervention offers an efficacious treatment option that also avoids the pitfalls of pharmacological modalities.",E,E

Hot flushes are the core symptoms that reflect the brain's response to the changing hormonal milieu of the menopause transition, particularly to the rapidly fluctuating and falling levels of estradiol. The physical symptoms of hot flushes and the associated changes in sleep, mood, and cognition will lead many women to seek medical care. It is critical to understand the interrelationship of hot flushes and other neuropsychological symptoms of the menopause transition so that treatment priorities can be established. For example, if sleep disruption explains most daytime neuropsychological problems in women with hot flushes, treating insomnia should be considered a priority. Alternatively, mood, cognition, and quality of life may be disturbed independent of sleep problems. In such a situation, each symptom should be evaluated separately from any assessment of sleep. As recent data from the WHI establish the risks of long-term HRT use, concern about using HRT, even as a short-term intervention, has increased substantially. Although HRT remains the first-line treatment for hot flushes, the WHI findings have drawn attention to nonhormonal treatments of hot flushes and other menopausal symptoms. Growing evidence to support the efficacy of serotonergic antidepressants and other psychoactive medications in the treatment for hot flushes suggests that nonhormonal interventions will prove important alternatives to HRT. As further evidence of the benefits of psychoactive medications for menopausal symptoms is established, the choice between using hormonal and nonhormonal therapies for management of menopausal symptoms will continue to evolve.",E,E

When oestrogen replacement is without benefit, both the underlying pathophysiology and management of this acquired genital female sexual arousal disorder are unclear. We aimed to study the effect of sildenafil on sexual arousal and orgasmic functioning of such women. Secondly, we aimed to explore the concordance between a detailed historical assessment of genital response in real life, with laboratory vaginal photoplethysmographic assessment of genital vasocongestion.; Session one consisted of a semi-structured clinical interview to assess real life sexual arousal. Session two employed vaginal pulse amplitude and self-report questionnaire assessment of erotica-induced sexual arousal. Sessions three and four were a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover administration of sildenafil on orgasm latency, intensity, perception of genital congestion and subjective arousal to erotica plus clitoral vibrostimulation.; University associated Sexual Medicine Clinic and Psychophysiology Laboratory.; Volunteer sample of 34 oestrogenised postmenopausal women with acquired genital female sexual arousal disorder and impaired orgasm.; Sildenafil (50 mg) or placebo administered over two laboratory sessions.; Orgasm latency and intensity during drug sessions; subjective and psychophysiological sexual arousal during photoplethysmography session.; The erotic video significantly increased subjective sexual arousal in all women. Vaginal pulse amplitude responses varied from robust to absent. Although across all women, sildenafil improved neither arousal nor orgasm, subsequent analyses comparing high versus low vaginal pulse amplitude responders revealed significantly reduced latency to orgasm, and increased subjective sexual arousal and perception of genital arousal in the latter group of women.; The data suggest that oestrogenised postmenopausal women with genital female sexual arousal disorder and orgasmic impairment based only on clinical assessment do not benefit from sildenafil. However, the photoplethysmograph had predictive value-those women showing low vaginal pulse amplitude response benefited from sildenafil compared with women with a higher response. Thus, oestrogenised women diagnosed with acquired genital female sexual arousal disorder may be a heterogeneous group and the photoplethysmograph might be useful in their further characterisation.",E,E

Estimated Ca balance decreased significantly during GnRH-a treatment alone. The addition of MPA attenuated the increases in phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and 2-h fasting and 24-h urinary Ca excretion, and the decrease in estimated Ca balance. Comparison of phase order demonstrated that MPA prevented 24-h urinary Ca excretion and urinary hydroxyproline loss and decline in estimated Ca balance when it was added back during the second 12 weeks (protocol B) but not during the first 12 weeks (protocol A).

Sixteen nonsmoking, eumenorrheic women (age 23.2 +/- 1.4 years, 68.7 +/- 1.0 kg) were studied at sea level and during 12 days of high-altitude exposure (4,300 m). Subjects received either alpha-blockade (prazosin 3 mg/d) or a placebo in a double-blinded, randomized fashion. Resting plasma and 24-hour urine samples were collected periodically throughout the duration of the study. Further, subjects participated in submaximal exercise tests (50 minutes at 50% sea level maximum oxygen consumption [Vo2max]) at Sea level and on days 1 and 12 at altitude. Urinary norepinephrine (NE) excretion rates increased significantly over time at altitude, with blocked subjects having greater values compared to controls. Plasma NE levels increased significantly with chronic altitude exposure compared to sea level and acute hypoxia both at rest and during exercise. NE levels at rest were greater for blocked compared to control subjects during all conditions. Urinary and plasma epinephrine (EPI) levels increased dramatically, with acute altitude exposure returning to sea level values by day 12 of altitude exposure. EPI levels were greater for blocked compared to placebo both at rest and during exercise for all conditions studied. Changes in alpha-adrenergic activity over time at altitude were associated with select metabolic and physiologic adjustments. The presence of alpha-blockade significantly affected these responses during chronic altitude exposure. It was concluded that: (1) alpha-adrenergic blockade elicited a potentiated sympathoadrenal response to the stress of both exercise as well as high-altitude exposure, and (2) the sympathetics, via alpha-adrenergic stimulation, contribute to a number of key adaptations associated with acclimatization to high altitude.",E,E

This 4-year, prospective, randomized study was carried out to monitor any added beneficial effect on bone mineral density when hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) was combined with etidronate.; Fifty-eight early postmenopausal women attending metabolic bone disease outpatient clinics were randomly allocated into four treatment groups and monitored for up to 4 years. All patients received 1.0 g/d of elemental calcium. In addition, group 1 received percutaneously administered HRT (n = 15); group 2, intermittent cyclical etidronate (ICE) (n = 14); group 3, HRT and ICE (n = 15); and group 4, calcium alone (n = 14). The bone mineral density (measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), biochemical variables of bone turnover, including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and urinary hydroxyproline:creatinine ratios were measured before treatment and at 2 and 4 years after treatment.; In patients who received the combined therapy, bone mineral density was increased in the vertebrae by 10.9% (P < 0.001) and in the femora by 7.25% (P < 0.001) at 4 years. For patients treated with ICE, the increase was 6.79% (P < 0.001) and 1.20% (P < 0.05), and with HRT, 6.78% (P < 0.001) and 4.01% (P < 0.01) in the vertebrae and femora, respectively. The group treated with calcium alone lost 3.81% (P < 0.01) and 4.96% (P < 0.01) of bone mineral density in vertebrae and femora. Patients who received no specific therapy lost 8.58% (P < 0.01) from vertebrae, and 7.83% (P < 0.01) from the femora over 4 years. Patients who received combined therapy had significantly higher bone mineral density in both vertebrae (P < 0.05) and femora (P < 0.01), in comparison to patients who were treated with HRT, or ICE, alone.

The women were randomly assigned into 3 groups: group A (136 cases, nylestriol 2 mg/2 wk), group B (97, nylestriol 1 mg/2 wk) and group C (50, placebo/2wk). LDL-C decreased and HDL-C increased after 3 months of medication (P < 0.05), but TC and TG not significantly changed in any group (P > 0.05). No changes of lipids were found in group C (P > 0.05). Serum ALP, Ca/Cr and Hpr/Cr in fasting urine decreased in 3 months in both group A and B (P < 0.05), but not in group C (P > 0.05). Forearm bone mineral content loss was restrained in groups A and B (P > 0.05), but decreased markedly in group C (P < 0.01). The Kupperman index scores decreased by about 50% after 3 months and 80% in 12 months in groups A and B. Nylestriol induced mild stimulatory effect on the uterine endometrium, and addition of 6 mg of provera daily for 7-10 days every 6 months is recommended. Nylestriol exhibited no obvious effect on the breast. This study demonstrated that nylestriol can be used as an effective and acceptable estrogen replacement therapy for postmenopausal women.",I,I

The patches were changed twice a week and treatment continued for 12 weeks. No progestogen supplement therapy was given during the study. No previous hormone replacement therapy had been given for the last six months and the women had had their last menstruation more than six months ago. As a part of a larger study assessing women's quality of life, a Swedish version of 'McCoy's Sex Scale Questionnaire' was administered at the start of treatment and after 12 weeks. This questionnaire contains nine items regarding different aspects of sexual life. The difference between the scorings at the start of treatment and after 12 weeks were calculated for each item and the values of the E and the P groups were compared. Items regarding 'satisfaction with frequency of sexual activity, sexual fantasies, degree of enjoyment, vaginal lubrication and pain during intercourse' were positively influenced in the E group compared to the P group. Items not affected were 'frequency of orgasm and sexual arousal'. A correlation between improved sexual life and quality of life was also found when the results from the McCoy scale were compared with a battery of quality of life questionnaires.",I,I

Participants were 54,845 postmenopausal United States nurses, who reported both hormone use and cholecystectomy on mailed questionnaires.; Cholecystectomy was reported by 1750 women during 8 years of follow-up. After adjusting for confounding factors, women currently using postmenopausal hormones were at an increased risk of cholecystectomy (relative risk [RR] 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-2.4) compared to never-users. For current users, the risk of cholecystectomy increased with increasing duration of hormone use (RR 2.6, 95% CI 2.2-3.1 for 10 years or more) and higher doses of estrogen (RR 2.4, 95% CI 2.0-2.9 for users of 1.25 mg or more). Although the risk for past hormone users decreased substantially in women who had discontinued use 1-2.9 years ago (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.0), a small risk persisted for women who had stopped taking hormones 5 or more years previously (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6).

Didrogesterone 10 mg was also given to all women for 12 days of every 28-day cycle. The objectives were to compare the efficacy and safety profiles of Menorest and an oral estrogen. A statistically significant reduction in the mean number of hot flushes occurred in each group compared to baseline with a decrease from 7.1 at baseline to 0.9 at 12 weeks in the Menorest group, and from 6.7 to 0.5 in the oral estrogen group; there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.36). With each successive treatment cycle, there was a continuous improvement in the number of hot flushes. The incidence and severity of menopausal symptoms were reduced in the same manner in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences in the mean plasma estradiol and estrone concentrations between the two treatment groups after 10 weeks of therapy. The mean estradiol to estrone ratio was similar in both groups, as was the number of adverse events observed.

Postmenopausal women were treated for 9 weeks with either a combination of 1.25 mg esterified estrogen and 2.5 mg methyltestosterone (E+A) or 1.25 mg conjugated equine estrogen (CEE). Both groups showed a similar decrease in urinary excretion of the bone resorption markers, deoxypyridinoline, pyridinoline, and hydroxyproline. Patients treated with CEE showed decreases in the serum markers of bone formation, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and C-terminal procollagen peptide. In contrast, subjects treated with E+A showed increases in these markers of bone formation. CEE increased, and E+A decreased serum levels of sex hormone-binding globulin as well as triglycerides and high density lipoprotein levels. Only CEE significantly reduced low density lipoproteins. Both regimens were effective in reducing postmenopausal somatic symptoms, but only E+A had a significant effect on psychological symptoms. We conclude that short term administration of androgen with estrogen may reverse the inhibitory effects of estrogen on bone formation. Long term studies are needed to determine the relative benefits and risks of the combination of estrogen and androgen and whether this results in greater increases in bone mass and strength.",E,E

Smokers were more likely to withdraw than non-smokers. There were no clear differences between the two groups in symptoms often attributed to hormone replacement therapy or in blood pressure or weight. At one year low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations had fallen substantially in both groups. High density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations rose to significantly higher values in women taking oestrogen alone compared with those taking oestrogen plus progestogen, though triglyceride concentrations and factor VII activity were also significantly higher in this group. Fibrinogen concentration tended to fall, though not significantly, in both groups, possibly more in women taking oestrogen alone.; Oestrogen plus progestogen was no less well tolerated than oestrogen alone. There was a fairly even balance between possibly beneficial and adverse effects of the two regimens on lipid concentrations and coagulability. Concern that the combined regiment may not have the cardioprotective effects ascribed to oestrogen alone can to some extent be allayed, with reassurance for the growing numbers of women with intact uteri using the combined regiment. Misgivings about the combined regiment in women with hysterectomy on the grounds of its acceptability and its effects on lipid values may also be unfounded.",E,E

Sixty-nine menopausal women, aged 45-60 years without previous hormonal replacement therapy, diagnosed as major depression without psychotic or suicidal symptoms (DSM-III-R criteria), were randomly assigned to a 3-month treatment with transdermal oestradiol [Estraderm TTS (ETTS) 50 micrograms, applied twice weekly] or placebo. No other psychoactive medication was allowed. After removal of protocol violators, 32 patients were evaluable in each group, which did not differ in age, height or weight. As five patients discontinued prematurely in both groups and in one placebo patient a post-drug EEG could not be obtained, 27 patients remained in the ETTS and 26 in the placebo group for efficacy analysis. While in the placebo group, oestradiol (E2) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) remained unchanged, E2 increased and FSH decreased significantly in the ETTS group. Syndromal evaluation showed a significant improvement in the Kupperman Index (KI) as well as Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) in both groups, with no inter-group difference. However, EEG mapping demonstrated significant inter-drug differences in brain function, mostly over the left temporal region. While ETTS patients showed an increase of alpha and alpha-adjacent theta activity and a decrease of beta activity, as well as an acceleration of the delta/theta centroid and a slowing of the alpha, beta and total power centroid, no changes occurred in the placebo-treated patients. These neurophysiological findings suggest improvement of vigilance by oestrogen, previously referred to as ""mental tonic"" effect. There were no changes, however, in the frontal alpha asymmetry index, reflecting left frontal hypo- and right frontal hyperactivation. Thus, this neurophysiological variable represents a state-independent marker for depression. The tolerability of ETTS was very good.",E,E

While low doses of estrogens (0.3 mg/day of conjugated estrogens) can counteract neurovegetative menopausal symptoms, higher doses (0.625 mg/day of conjugated estrogens) are required to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that ipriflavone, a non-hormonal isoflavone derivative, is effective in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ipriflavone and very low doses of equine conjugated estrogens on bone loss in early postmenopausal women. Eighty-three healthy postmenopausal women (50.3 +/- 0.7 years) were enrolled for this 1-year multicenter study. All subjects were randomly allocated to receive: double placebo (n = 24; group A), placebo plus conjugated equine estrogens 0.30 mg/day (n = 31; group B) or conjugated equine estrogens 0.30 mg/day plus oral ipriflavone 200 mg tris in die at meals (n = 28; group C), according to a double-masked design. Among women who completed the treatment period (valid completers), those of group A showed a progressive decrease in forearm bone density (FBD; measured by dual photon absorptiometry) that reached 1.7% after 12 months. The women in group B maintained their FBD in the first 6 months of treatment but, at the end of the study, showed a bone loss of 1.4% compared with basal values. By contrast, women in group C showed a significant increase in FBD after 1 year of treatment (+5.6%; p < 0.01). Both valid completers and intention to treat analyses revealed a significant difference (p < 0.05) between group A and group C over the study period. None of the treatments produced significant changes of biochemical markers of bone turnover, while hot flushes and other climacteric symptoms were significantly reduced after the sixth month of treatment in women receiving estrogens. Adverse events were generally mild, and did not differ among the groups. The results of this study suggest that low doses of estrogens combined with ipriflavone could represent a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of the postmenopausal syndrome.",I,I

After 13 years of follow-up in national registries, 2,330 incident cancer cases and 848 cancer deaths were observed. Overall, our results were reassuring since incidence rate ratios (SIRs) for 16 cancer sites and mortality ratios (SMRs) for all 10 examined sites were at, or lower than, unity. However, we found that exposure to an estrogen-progestin combined brand was associated with an increasing relative risk of breast cancer with follow-up time, the SIR reaching 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.8) after 10 years of follow-up. The relative risk of endometrial cancer was substantially increased, with the highest SIR of 5.0 (95% CI 1.6-5.9) in women prescribed estrogens alone, whereas those given an estrogen-progestin combination showed no elevation in risk. The risk estimates for liver and biliary tract cancers and for colon cancer were reduced by about 40%, notably in women prescribed the estradiol-progestin compound. Further detailed analyses revealed no evidence of adverse or protective effects on the risk of ovarian, uterine cervical, vulvar/vaginal, rectal, pancreatic, renal, lung, thyroid and other endocrine cancers, brain tumors, malignant melanoma or other skin cancers. Hormone replacement therapy was not associated with an increase in mortality for any cancer site, at this time of follow-up. For breast and endometrial cancers, SMRs were below baseline but tended to increase with follow-up time. We conclude that hormone replacement increases the endometrial-cancer risk after unopposed estrogens and the breast-cancer risk-notably after estrogen-progestin combined therapy-and tentatively suggest that it exerts a protective effect against colon and liver cancer risks.",I,I

An oral progestin was also given for 10 days each cycle. The objectives were to compare local and systemic tolerability and efficacy in the treatment of menopausal symptoms. One-hundred and ninety-four [194] patients (96 and 98 patients in the Menorest 50 and the reservoir transdermal patch groups, respectively) were considered in the intent-to-treat population and 204 (102 in each group) in the safety population. The two treatment groups were comparable with regard to the demographic data and menopausal status. The primary efficacy criteria were the comparison between Menorest 50 and the reservoir transdermal patch in erythema and pruritus at application sites and the difference between the treatment groups in the mean number of hot flushes per day at week 12, adjusted for baseline. A statistically significant reduction in the mean number of hot flushes was observed in each group compared with baseline, with a decrease from 6.5 at baseline to 0.3 at 12 weeks and 6.4 to 0.4 in the Menorest 50 and reservoir transdermal patch groups respectively; there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups during the 12-week treatment. The severity score of menopausal symptoms was also dramatically improved in each of the two treatment groups. There were no statistically significant differences in the mean plasma estradiol concentrations and mean estradiol to estrone ratio (> 1.0) in both groups after 10 weeks of therapy. A similar number of adverse events was observed in both groups. Menorest 50 showed better local tolerability than the reservoir transdermal patch with a lower incidence of topical adverse events, erythema and pruritus. In summary, Menorest 50 was as effective as the reservoir transdermal patch in reducing the mean number of hot flushes, and improving the severity of other menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor, psychiatric and urogenital symptoms.",E,E

Vaginal dryness index, itching, irritation, dyspareunia, pH and safety were evaluated every week the first month and every month thereafter.; Both treatments had a significant increase on vaginal dryness index as soon as the first week of treatment, and the hormonal compound was significantly better than the non-hormonal one. All symptoms such as itching, irritation and dyspareunia significantly decreased or disappeared without any difference between the two treatments. For pH, no significant difference was seen either in each group or between the two groups. No adverse events related with the two drugs were found.; This study shows that Replens applied vaginally three times a week, is a full therapy for all symptoms of vaginal atrophy as well as local estrogen.

Secretory endometrium was detected in 65% and 54% of the samples taken at the end of treatment with E2-DG and E2-NETA, respectively. No hyperplasia or atypia was found. No serious adverse events related to treatment occurred.; Both regimens alleviated effectively menopausal complaints and did not induce hyperplasia of endometrium. The minor differences recorded between the two regimens were probably due to the differences in their composition concerning the amount of estradiol and its distribution along the cycle, the amount and type of progestin and the length of estradiol/progestin combination phase.",E,E

After a 4-week, treatment-free period, each woman received a continuous regimen of either one E2 transdermal system, two E2 transdermal systems, or placebo transdermal system(s) applied every week for 12 weeks. Efficacy was measured as reduction in hot flush frequency, determined from subject diaries. To measure local tolerance, skin irritation (erythema and edema) was objectively and systematically evaluated under blue light after removal of the transdermal system(s). Serum E2 and estrone concentrations were determined in one of the studies during baseline and on days 1, 9, 30, 58, 79, and 84.; Mean hot flush frequency decreased from 80 hot flushes per week at baseline to approximately 13 hot flushes per week (84% decrease) after 12 weeks of transdermal E2 treatment. Compared with placebo, the decrease in hot flush frequency was significant as early as weeks 2 and 3, and was maintained through the end of the study. Few clinically significant skin reactions occurred, and only nine (3%) of the subjects withdrew because of a skin effect. After initial increase, serum E2 concentrations remained stable throughout the study, achieving values of approximately 20 and 40 pg/mL above baseline for one and two E2 transdermal systems, respectively.; The E2 transdermal system effectively reduced the frequency of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms as early as the second week of therapy and was very well tolerated. The decrease in hot flush frequency was similar to that reported for oral and other transdermal estrogens, but at lower serum E2 concentrations. This result may be due to the stable E2 blood level achieved with this transdermal system.",I,I

Among the unopposed EE2 groups, only the 10-microg group had increased BMD above baseline, but also was accompanied by an unacceptably high rate of endometrial hyperplasia. The NA-EE2 treatment groups had a significant linear dose-response trend for increasing BMD. Increased endometrial proliferation and hyperplasia occurred with increasing unopposed estrogen doses. The combination of NA and EE2 effectively protected the endometrium against hyperplasia. The percentage of change in the ratio of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was positive for all treatment groups. The increase in triglyceride levels associated with EE2 was attenuated with NA-EE2 treatment.; Daily treatment with NA-EE2 was well tolerated and protected the endometrium from EE2-induced proliferation and hyperplasia.

T-lymphocytes are capable of secreting bone resorptive cytokines and have also been linked with bone metabolism and the development of osteoporosis. Cytokine secretion from whole blood cell cultures was compared between two randomized groups of healthy early post-menopausal women (mean age 52.5 yrs, N = 91) and lymphocyte subsets were quantitated by flow cytometry. One group received cyclic estrogen-gestagen replacement therapy (ERT) while the other group was untreated. In spite of a significant bone maintaining effect of ERT, the basal and LPS-stimulated secretion of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-1ra was identical in the two groups. There was no association between cytokine release and bone mass or loss assessed over 2 yrs. The only exception was a weak estrogen-independent correlation between basal IL-1ra secretion and bone loss (r = -0.21, p < 0.05). Flow cytometry did not confirm a relationship between CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios and bone density or loss, and there was no effect of ERT on lymphocyte subsets. The number of CD3+ CD56+ T-cells showed a highly significant negative correlation with femoral and lumbar bone density in untreated women (r = -0.42, p < 0.01) similar to that found in patients with established osteoporosis, indicating that these adherent mononuclear cells may be important in the pathophysiology of post-menopausal bone loss. The possibility that IL-1ra acts as an independent bone-sparing factor unrelated to estrogen withdrawal warrants further investigation. In conclusion, ERT maintains bone without affecting the release of the IL-1 family of cytokines in whole blood cultures.",I,I

Two markers of bone formation, osteocalcin (OC) and bone alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), and two markers of bone resorption, urinary N-telopeptide (NTx) and urinary free deoxypyridinoline (fDpd), as well as spine and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) were measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Women receiving HRT (n = 105) showed a significant increase in spine BMD (+2.5%; P < 0.0001) and hip BMD (+1.0%; P = 0.02) compared to women receiving CS, who showed a decline at both sites (-1.1%; P < 0.01). All four markers showed time-dependent decreases in women receiving HRT (P < 0.001) and no change in women receiving CS alone. When baseline indexes of turnover were stratified by quartile, there was a significantly greater increase in BMD among those with the highest NTx, OC, and BSAP levels compared to that in those with the lowest NTx, OC, and BSAP levels (P < 0.05). The highest quartile for percent change from baseline to 6 months in fDpd, BSAP, and NTx was also associated with the greatest change in spine BMD at 1 yr. Receiver operator characteristic curves for percent change from baseline to 6 months in an individual marker to 1 yr change in BMD during HRT revealed that the percent change in NTx provided the greatest discrimination between gain and loss of BMD. When subjects receiving HRT were compared by their positive or negative skeletal response at 1 yr and their baseline turnover marker, initial NTx values were significantly higher in those that gained bone than in those that lost bone (P = 0.0002). CS women in the highest quartile for NTx at baseline had significantly greater decreases in spine BMD than subjects with the lowest NTx values (P < 0.005), although this was not true for fDpd (P < 0.20). In conclusion, for early postmenopausal women there are differential responses of biochemical markers to HRT and CS. Baseline urinary NTx and serum OC were the most sensitive predictors of change in spine BMD after 1 yr of either HRT or CS. Similarly, the percent change in NTx and OC from baseline to 6 months best predicted bone gain or loss. We conclude that markers of bone formation and resorption can be used clinically to predict future BMD in early postmenopausal women.",I,I

Clinical and research experience with estrogen-androgen hormone replacement therapy, as well as androgen-only therapy, suggests that the health benefit offered by androgen replacement exceeds the potential risk when treatment is properly managed. In this review, we concentrate on the effects of oral alkylated androgens. The virilizing effects (e.g., hirsutism, acne, voice change, and alopecia) of oral androgens are typically dose and duration dependent; androgen replacement at doses < or = 10 mg once daily administered for prolonged periods (> 6 months) produces masculinization effects that generally abate with dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment. No clinical sequelae or irreversible pathophysiologic effects have been associated with any virilization that may occur. Changes in lipoprotein metabolism associated with oral estrogen-androgen use include reduced total cholesterol levels and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels which may reduce the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease. No clinically identifiable risk with respect to other cardiovascular variables, such as blood pressure, has been associated with the longterm administration of low doses of oral androgen. With regard to liver toxicity, reports of jaundice, peliosis hepatis, and hepatocellular carcinoma are extremely rare at the dose levels of androgen used in hormone replacement therapy, although individual sensitivity to the potential hepatotoxic effects of oral alkylated and nonalkylated androgen may vary considerably. Daily dosing with oral alkylated androgen in combination with estrogen is well tolerated. Retrospective and prospective studies involving the use of androgens alone and in combination with estrogens demonstrate that concerns about the adverse effects of androgen use associated with supraphysiologic, self-escalated doses in men do not apply to the much lower doses combined with estrogens for hormone replacement in postmenopausal women.",E,E

However, estrogen-androgen replacement also reduces the beneficial increases in high-density lipoprotein induced by estrogens alone, although this effect may be offset at least partially by decreases in atherogenic triglycerides. The long-term net effect of estrogen-androgen replacement on cardiovascular disease remains unknown.; Although the literature includes relatively few clinical trials or well-controlled studies and is further limited by the subjective nature of outcomes, such as sexual and psychological function, the available data suggest that for many postmenopausal women, estrogen-androgen replacement may provide benefits beyond those provided by estrogen-only replacement therapy.",E,E

Patches were applied twice weekly for 12 weeks. Patients were assessed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean number of moderate to severe hot flushes (including night sweats) per 24 h during the last 2 weeks of treatment. Other variables included Kupperman Index, local and systemic tolerability. Plasma concentrations of estradiol (E2), estrone (E1) and estrone sulfate (E1S) were determined before and after treatment.; Estraderm MX was significantly superior to placebo (P < 0.001) in reducing mean number of moderate to severe hot flushes (including night sweats) per 24 h after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. The estimate of treatment group differences after 12 weeks was 4.2 hot flushes (95% confidence interval: 2.6-5.8).

(Marietta, Georgia), between 1989 and 1996 for Estratest and Estratest HS (half-strength). These oral esterified estrogens--methyltestosterone combination products have been marketed in the United States since 1964 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in patients whose symptoms have not been relieved by estrogens alone. Between 1989 and 1996, more than 1 million woman-years of exposure occurred. The safety profile contained in this paper is based on a cumulative total of 568 individual cases comprising 863 adverse events (AEs). The proportions of AEs associated with the use of Estratest (575 events; 66.6%) and Estratest HS (288 events; 33.4%) were commensurate with the proportions of individual reports of adverse experiences for the two formulations (369 reports [65.0%] and 199 reports [35.0%], respectively). The rank order and percentage of types of AEs reported were also similar. The cumulative volume of reports was relatively low given the extent of exposure. Despite the limitations inherent in spontaneous postmarketing surveillance, the safety profile derived from this assessment does not indicate a significant safety concern with Estratest or Estratest HS. No deaths were reported, and no adverse findings indicative of the need for more comprehensive surveillance or concern on the part of the medical community or consumers were observed. Reports of cancer, cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic phenomena, and hepatic dysfunction were few and were assessed as not related to treatment with Estratest or Estratest HS; reports of drug overdose, drug-drug interaction, and birth defects were rare (4 of 863 events; 0.5%). The most commonly reported AEs were those known to be associated with estrogen therapy (weight gain, headache, nausea, and vasodilatation) and androgen treatment (alopecia, acne, and hirsutism). Twenty-three (4.0%) of the 568 cases reported had at least one event that was regarded as serious, and 53 (6.1%) of the total 863 AEs were regarded as serious. The findings indicate that Estratest and Estratest HS are safe when used as directed and that the marginal increase in risk associated with androgen coadministration can be managed with appropriate patient selection and monitoring, as stated in the package insert for these compounds.",E,E

Vasomotor and behavioral effects were evaluated by using the Kupperman score, while changes in plasma endorphin (beta-END) levels were used as marker of neuroendocrine effects.; Postmenopausal women (n = 30) were randomly divided into three groups (ten women for each group); all women received continuous 17 beta-estradiol (50 mg, transdermal) and each group was sequentially treated with different progestins for 12 days/month: group A, cyproterone acetate (5 mg p.o.); group B, nomegestrol acetate (5 mg p.o.); and group C, progesterone (100 mg, vaginal cream). A group of healthy fertile women (n = 8) served as control. Before and after 6 months of HRT, postmenopausal women underwent an evaluation of subjective Kupperman score and two neuroendocrine tests: (a) naloxone (4 mg i.v.) and (b) clonidine (1.25 mg i.v.). Plasma beta-END levels were measured before and at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min after drug injection. Control women were studied by administering the two neuroendocrine tests only once.; Postmenopausal women before HRT showed a pathological Kupperman and no changes of plasma beta-END levels in response to the clonidine and naloxone tests score. On the contrary the increase was significant in healthy women. In each of the three groups of treated women both naloxone and clonidine tests induced a significant increase in plasma beta-END levels (P < 0.01). After 6 months of HRT, an improvement of vasomotor and psychological symptoms was shown by a decrease of Kupperman score.; The present study indicates that sequential treatment with transdermal 17 beta-estradiol and progestin, no matter which progestin was used, restores the beta-END release, improves vasomotor and psychological symptoms.",E,E

Sexual behavior and neuroendocrine responses.,Double-Blind Method; Estrogens; Female; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Hormone Replacement Therapy; Humans; Libido; Methyltestosterone; Middle Aged; Neurosecretory Systems; Postmenopause; Progestins; Sexual Behavior; Testosterone Congeners,"Sarrel, P; Dobay, B; Wiita, B","To investigate the efficacy of esterified estrogens alone and combined with oral androgen on sexual function and menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women.; Twenty postmenopausal women dissatisfied with their estrogen or estrogen-progestin therapy volunteered to enter a double-blind, randomized trial in which they received either oral esterified estrogens or esterified estrogens + androgen for eight weeks after a single-blind, placebo, lead-in period. Sexual function was assessed with a questionnaire used in the Yale midlife survey, and plasma levels of estradiol, estrone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and beta-endorphin were measured at two- to four-week intervals.; Estrogen-androgen therapy significantly improved sexual sensation and desire after four and eight weeks of double-blind treatment in comparison to previous estrogen therapy and postplacebo baseline assessments. Plasma levels of estradiol and estrone increased significantly in all patients as compared to the postplacebo baseline and decreased in comparison to circulating estrogen concentrations on previous therapy. Relative proportions of free and bound steroid hormone exhibited contrasting shifts during estrogen and estrogen-androgen therapy. SHBG increased in the estrogen group and decreased in the estrogen-androgen group, leading to lower amounts of free androgens during estrogen therapy and increased free androgen levels during estrogen-androgen therapy. Since proportions of free (bioavailable) ovarian steroids would correlate inversely with plasma protein binding capacity, the beneficial effects of oral estrogen-androgen therapy on sexual sensation and desire may be due either to the administered androgen or to the increased availability of endogenous and exogenous androgens, particularly in the central nervous system.; Sexual desire, satisfaction and frequency in postmenopausal women taking hormonal therapy were improved significantly by combined estrogen-androgen therapy but not by estrogen or estrogen-progestin therapy. Sexual function improved with estrogen-androgen therapy even though circulating estrogen levels were lower than those measured during previous estrogen therapy. This leads to the conclusion that androgens play a pivotal role in sexual function but that estrogens are not a significant factor determining levels of sexual drive and enjoyment.",E,E

Participants were assigned randomly to one of five groups: 1) placebo, 2) daily conjugated equine estrogens, 3) conjugated equine estrogens plus cyclical medroxyprogesterone acetate, 4) conjugated equine estrogens plus daily medroxyprogesterone acetate, and 5) conjugated equine estrogens plus cyclical micronized progesterone. Symptoms were self-reported using a checklist at 1 and 3 years. Factor analysis reduced 52 symptoms to a set of six symptom groups.; In intention-to-treat analyses at 1 year, each active treatment demonstrated a marked, statistically significant, protective effect against vasomotor symptoms compared with placebo (odds ratios [ORs] 0.17-0.28); there was no additional benefit of estrogen-progestin over estrogen alone. Only progestin-containing regimens were significantly associated with higher levels of breast discomfort (OR 1.92-2.27). Compared with placebo, women randomized to conjugated equine estrogens reported no increase in perceived weight. Those randomized to medroxyprogesterone acetate reported less perceived weight gain (OR 0.61-0.69) than placebo. Anxiety, cognitive, and affective symptoms did not differ by treatment assignment. Analyses restricted to adherent women were not materially different than those using intention-to-treat, except that women adherent to medroxyprogesterone acetate and micronized progesterone regimens reported fewer musculoskeletal symptoms (OR 0.62-0.68).; These results confirm the usefulness of post-menopausal hormone therapy for hot flashes, show convincingly that estrogen plus progestin causes breast discomfort, and demonstrate little influence of postmenopausal hormones on anxiety, cognition, or affect.",I,I

Fasting lipoproteins were measured at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. At each visit, participants completed Greene climacteric questionnaires and recorded any bleeding episodes. Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation if normally distributed, median and interquartile range if non-normally distributed, or as frequency count. For menopausal symptoms and diary card data, the differences were tested by Wilcoxon rank-sum test.; One hundred sixteen women received continuous combined HRT and 119 women received tibolone; 72 and 76 women, respectively, completed 12 months of therapy. Both treatments effectively relieved vasomotor symptoms and reduced serum total cholesterol. Continuous combined HRT, but not tibolone, significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein levels. Both treatments reduced high-density lipoprotein levels, but the effect was more profound with tibolone. The initial bleeding score was higher for women taking continuous combined HRT; however, by the end of the study, the percentages of amenorrheal women were comparable. Endometrial histology was similar for both treatments at the end of the study, although two cases of proliferative endometrium were found in the tibolone group.; Estradiol valerate-norethisterone continuous combined HRT controls symptoms and is associated with a safe lipid profile.",E,E
