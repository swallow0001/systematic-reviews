We investigated the efficacy of bisoprolol, a beta1 selective adrenoceptor blocker in decreasing all-cause mortality in chronic heart failure.; In a multicentre double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial in Europe, we enrolled 2647 symptomatic patients in New York Heart Association class III or IV, with left-ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less receiving standard therapy with diuretics and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. We randomly assigned patients bisoprolol 1.25 mg (n=1327) or placebo (n=1320) daily, the drug being progressively increased to a maximum of 10 mg per day. Patients were followed up for a mean of 1.3 years. Analysis was by intention to treat.; CIBIS-II was stopped early, after the second interim analysis, because bisoprolol showed a significant mortality benefit. All-cause mortality was significantly lower with bisoprolol than on placebo (156 [11.8%] vs 228 [17.3%] deaths with a hazard ratio of 0.66 (95% CI 0.54-0.81, p<0.0001). There were significantly fewer sudden deaths among patients on bisoprolol than in those on placebo (48 [3.6%] vs 83 [6.3%] deaths), with a hazard ratio of 0.56 (0.39-0.80, p=0.0011). Treatment effects were independent of the severity or cause of heart failure.; Beta-blocker therapy had benefits for survival in stable heart-failure patients. Results should not, however, be extrapolated to patients with severe class IV symptoms and recent instability because safety and efficacy has not been established in these patients.",I,I
10024334,Irbesartan reduces QT dispersion in hypertensive individuals.,"Aged; Amlodipine; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Antihypertensive Agents; Biphenyl Compounds; Double-Blind Method; Electrocardiography; Female; Heart; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Receptors, Angiotensin; Tetrazoles","Lim, P O; Nys, M; Naas, A A; Struthers, A D; Osbakken, M; MacDonald, T M","Angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists have direct effects on the autonomic nervous system and myocardium. Because of this, we hypothesized that irbesartan would reduce QT dispersion to a greater degree than amlodipine, a highly selective vasodilator. To test this, we gathered electrocardiographic (ECG) data from a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind parallel group study that compared the antihypertensive efficacy of irbesartan and amlodipine in elderly subjects with mild to moderate hypertension. Subjects were treated for 6 months with either drug. Hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol were added after 12 weeks if blood pressure (BP) remained uncontrolled. ECGs were obtained before randomization and at 6 months. A total of 188 subjects (118 with baseline ECGs) were randomized. We analyzed 104 subjects who had complete ECGs at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Baseline characteristics between treatments were similar, apart from a slight imbalance in diastolic BP (irbesartan [n=53] versus amlodipine [n=51], 99.2 [SD 3. 6] versus 100.8 [3.8] mm Hg; P=0.03). There were no significant differences in BP normalization (diastolic BP <90 mm Hg) between treatments at 6 months (irbesartan versus amlodipine, 80% versus 88%; P=0.378). We found a significant reduction in QT indexes in the irbesartan group (QTc dispersion mean, -11.4 [34.5] milliseconds, P=0.02; QTc max, -12.8 [35.5] milliseconds, P=0.01), and QTc dispersion did not correlate with the change in BP. The reduction in QT indexes with amlodipine (QTc dispersion, -9.7 [35.4] milliseconds, P=0.06; QTc max, -8.6 [33.2] milliseconds, P=0.07) did not quite reach statistical significance, but there was a correlation between the change in QT indexes and changes in systolic BP. In conclusion, irbesartan improved QT dispersion, and this effect may be important in preventing sudden cardiac death in at-risk hypertensive subjects.",E,E

While 70 to 78% of patients admitted to Norwegian university hospitals during 1990-1997 for angiographic evaluation of chest pain used beta-blockers, only 43-60% of patients with stable coronary artery disease enrolled in the 4S study in Norway received such treatment. High risk groups such as diabetics and patients with peripheral artery disease were less likely to receive beta-blockers during the early period, but were not treated differentially compared to low risk patients during recent years. Only 15% of patients with congestive heart failure received oral beta-blockers, and only 10.5% intravenous beta-blockade during acute myocardial infarction. The dosing of the most common beta-blockers were low, approximately 50% of doses shown to improve survival after acute myocardial infarction.",E,E

The data were evaluated twice by the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These meetings resulted in opposite decisions by the advisory committee. The crux of the argumentation was the two-positive-trial FDA paradigm. Carvedilol did not meet the usual paradigm because an exercise end point was not statistically different from placebo in three U.S. trials. Most other end points were highly significant, and death, which was monitored across the U.S. program, was different with p < 0.0001. Here we argue that the usual paradigm is very useful but not an absolute principle, that the usual paradigm can sometimes miss the strength of evidence even in the primary end points, and that rational decision making requires on occasion that other evidence must lead to approval. Control of the type I error rate should be taken very seriously, should rarely be violated, and serves the biomedical community well. It is not an absolute principle, however, but rather must be considered in context.",E,E
10027499,End-point interpretation in clinical trials: the case for discipline.,Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Carbazoles; Drug Approval; Heart Failure; Humans; Propanolamines; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; United States,"Moy茅, L A","The recent submission of a new drug application to the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has led to vigorous discussion concerning the rules of clinical trial conduct. The regulatory importance of prospectively defined end points, long held as a fundamental tenet of well-designed research efforts, and the proper role of alpha-spending functions in clinical trials are current foci of attention. Sound public policy requires that the highest research standards govern statistical analyses to support a new drug application. These research standards should be rooted in the fundamentals of epidemiology and biostatistics, long accepted by clinical trial workers. Also, because the physician-scientists whose research results are disseminated to the community bear considerable responsibility for both that community's protection and the protection of the individual patient, these investigators must provide unambiguous interpretations of type I and type II error rates. This obligation includes clear prospective statements of analysis plans and complete reporting of findings for the prospectively defined endpoints in presentations and in manuscripts. The public health is best served if regulatory agencies continue to join clinical trial workers in repudiating the philosophy of ""sound methodology or a small p-value"" in judging research efforts. Reviewers of new drug applications might best take the tack ""judge first what the investigators set out to do, then judge what else was discovered in an 'exploratory light.'""",E,E
10028936,Total arterial compliance in ambulatory hypertension during selective beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.,"Adrenergic Antagonists; Adult; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Antihypertensive Agents; Aorta; Atenolol; Blood Pressure; Captopril; Cross-Over Studies; Echocardiography, Doppler; Electrocardiography; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Ventricular Function","Soma, J; Aakhus, S; Dahl, K; Wider酶e, T E; Skjaerpe, T","Aortic root flow and pressure estimates were obtained noninvasively with Doppler echocardiography and calibrated subclavian artery pulse tracing in 30 subjects with ambulatory hypertension in a randomized, crossover study with 4 weeks' treatment and washout periods. Total arterial compliance, assessed by use of a three-element Windkessel model of the arterial tree, increased 42% with atenolol (50-100 mg once daily), and 7% (p = NS) with captopril (25-50 mg twice daily). Atenolol reduced mean arterial pressure by 15%, heart rate by 22%, and cardiac output by 14%, and increased acceleration time of aortic root flow by 17% and stroke volume and ejection time each by 11%. Captopril reduced mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance each by 7%. Acceleration time of aortic root flow, ejection time, heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output were not significantly changed by captopril. We conclude that total arterial compliance, at the operational blood pressure, increases during selective beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade in subjects with ambulatory hypertension. Although the main mechanism may be a reduction in mean arterial pressure, it should be considered whether reduced heart rate may play an additional role. The nonsignificant increase in total arterial compliance during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may primarily be a consequence of a modest reduction of the mean arterial pressure.",E,E

Predictors of readmission were determined by stepwise logistic regression analysis and predictor of time to readmission with Cox Proportionate Hazards modeling p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.; Mean age of the 237 pts was 66.5 yrs; 56% women. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 29%; 96% were in NYHA class III/IV. Mean length of stay was 5 days; 52 pts (22%) had > 1 admission. CHF etiologies: Ischemic (42%), hypertensive (37%), idiopathic (12%). Demographic characteristics and insurance status did not predict readmission risk. Predictors of readmission in the logistic and Cox models were similar. Increased risk of readmission was associated with myocardial ischemia (logistic OR 42.7), past NYHA Class III and IV (OR 32.8), plasmatic creatinine at discharge (OR 1.9) and continued smoking (OR 3.26). History of CABG was associated with a decreased risk of rehospitalization (OR 0.12). Beta-blocker use was associated with decreased risk, but did not achieve statistical significance. ACE-I use (prescribed in 78% of pts), did not contribute to the model. Diabetes Mellitus and a lower LVEF were more frequent in the readmitted group, but they did not predict readmission.; CHF pts who have evidence of ischemia, advanced symptoms, renal dysfunction, and who continue to smoke are at increased risk for hospital readmission. Pts with these characteristics should be identified prior to hospital discharge and considered for intensive outpatient intervention.",1,E

Former studies, performed between 1967 and 1987, are devoted, in chronological order, to special populations or to forms of hypertension not sufficiently studied previously (elders and isolated systolic hypertension), using classical pharmacological treatments such as diuretics and beta blockers. Their results confirm the reduction in mortality obtained using such therapies. Ensuing studies, focused on the analysis of new drugs such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, also demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular risk, even in severely damaged populations. Thereafter, meta analysis of new pharmacological treatments and of non pharmacological therapies such as sodium restriction, weight reduction, avoidance of alcohol intake, calcium and potassium supplementation have appeared. These studies have emphasized the importance of prevention through changes in lifestyles. Their positive, although modest results, encourage the assessment of long term preventive and therapeutic measures in hypertension.",I,8

The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) is a randomised intervention trial to compare the effects of ACE inhibition and conventional therapy on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension.; CAPPP was a prospective, randomised, open trial with blinded endpoint evaluation. 10,985 patients were enrolled at 536 health centres in Sweden and Finland. Patients aged 25-66 years with a measured diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or more on two occasions were randomly assigned captopril or conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics, beta-blockers). Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The primary endpoint was a composite of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths.; Of 5492 patients assigned captopril and 5493 assigned conventional therapy, 14 and 13, respectively, were lost to follow-up. Primary endpoint events occurred in 363 patients in the captopril group (11.1 per 1000 patient-years) and 335 in the conventional-treatment group (10.2 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.05 [95% CI 0.90-1.22], p=0-52). Cardiovascular mortality was lower with captopril than with conventional treatment (76 vs 95 events; relative risk 0.77 [0.57-1-04], p=0.092), the rate of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction was similar (162 vs 161), but fatal and non-fatal stroke was more common with captopril (189 vs 148; 1.25 [1-01-1-55]. p=0.044).; Captopril and conventional treatment did not differ in efficacy in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The difference in stroke risk is probably due to the lower levels of blood pressure obtained initially in previously treated patients randomised to conventional therapy.",E,E
10047618,Sotalol: An important new antiarrhythmic.,"Action Potentials; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Anti-Arrhythmia Agents; Atrial Fibrillation; Defibrillators, Implantable; Drug Interactions; Electrocardiography; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence; Refractory Period, Electrophysiological; Sotalol; Tachycardia, Ventricular; Torsades de Pointes; Ventricular Fibrillation; Ventricular Premature Complexes","Anderson, J L; Prystowsky, E N","Sotalol, the most recently approved oral antiarrhythmic drug, has a unique pharmacologic profile. Its electrophysiology is explained by nonselective beta-blocking action as well as class III antiarrhythmic activity (including fast-activating cardiac membrane-delayed rectifier current blockade), which leads to increases in action potential duration and refractory period throughout the heart and in QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram. Its better hemodynamic tolerance than other beta-blockers may be a result of enhanced inotropy associated with class III activity. Sotalol's ability to suppress ventricular ectopy is similar to that of class I agents and better than that of standard beta-blockers. Unlike class I agents, its use in a postinfarction trial was not associated with increased mortality rate. Therapeutically, it has shown superior efficacy for prevention of recurrent ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, which was the basis for its approval. In a randomized study, the Electrophysiologic Study Versus Electrocardiographic Monitoring (ESVEM) trial, sotalol was associated with an increased in-hospital efficacy prediction rate (by Holter monitor or electrophysiologic study), reduced long-term arrhythmic recurrence rate with superior tolerance, and lower mortality rate than class I (""standard"") antiarrhythmic drugs. Sotalol was 1 of 2 drugs selected for comparison with implantable defibrillators in the recent National Institutes of Health Antiarrhythmics versus Implantable Defibrillator (AVID) study. Sotalol appears to be a preferred drug for use with implantable defibrillators; unlike some other agents (eg, amiodarone) it does not elevate and, indeed, may lower defibrillation threshold. Although unapproved for this use, sotalol is active against atrial arrhythmias. It has shown efficacy equivalent to propafenone and quinidine in preventing atrial fibrillation recurrence, but it is better tolerated than quinidine and provides excellent rate control during recurrence. Sotalol's major side effects are related to beta-blockade and the risk of torsades de pointes (acceptably small if appropriate precautions are taken). Unlike several other antiarrhythmics (eg, amiodarone), it has no pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions, is not metabolized, and is entirely renally excreted. Initial dose is 80 mg twice daily, with gradual titration to 240 to 360 mg/day as needed. The daily dose must be reduced in renal failure. On the basis of favorable clinical trials and practice experience, sotalol has shown a steadily growing impact on the treatment of arrhythmias during its 5 years of market availability, a trend that is likely to continue.",E,E

The open-artery hypothesis suggests that a patent infarct-related artery confers a survival benefit greater than that expected from myocardial salvage alone, which extends beyond the time when preservation of left ventricular function is expected. We examined the survival experience of patients undergoing thrombolysis in the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and TPA for Occluded Arteries (GUSTO-I) trial for whom data on the potency of the infarct artery were available. Univariable analysis was used to determine the unadjusted relations of angiographic variables and revascularization procedures to both 30-day and 1-year mortality in 30-day survivors. Multivariable analysis was used to test for interactions between patency and each characteristic and to adjust both for all other variables and for baseline characteristics known to predict mortality. In both univariable and multivariable analysis, patients with an open rather than a closed infarct-related artery had significantly lower 30-day mortality (p <0.001). This benefit cannot be accounted for by myocardial salvage alone, because it remained after adjustment for left ventricular ejection fraction. Patency was also associated with lower 1-year mortality in 30-day survivors, but not after adjustment for other variables affecting late mortality. Having an open infarct-related artery at the time of first catheterization confers a survival advantage that extends beyond the benefit of myocardial salvage from thrombolytic therapy, and is independent of ejection fraction.",E,E

The heart rate variability was determined over a period of 24 h. Parameters determined: standard deviation of the mean of all corrected RR intervals, standard deviation of all 5 min mean cycle lengths, square root of the mean of the squared differences of successive corrected RR intervals. Nifedipine reduced the mean values of all heart rate variability parameters tested. Square root of the mean of the square differences of successive corrected RR intervals increased under bisoprolol. Standard deviation of the mean of all corrected RR intervals and standard deviation of all 5 min mean cycle lengths increased from low baseline values and declined from higher baseline values. The increase in heart rate variability under therapy was accompanied by a tendency towards a better prognosis. Patients with an increase in heart rate variability and simultaneous complete suppression of ischaemia under therapy displayed no serious events in the course of one year.; The increase in the heart rate variability, which can be regarded as prognostically favourable, was predominantly observed under bisoprolol. The parameter constellation of an increase in heart rate variability and complete ischaemia suppression on the 48-h Holter ECG was associated with the greatest benefit.",E,E

After a 7-day placebo run-in at the end of which a symptom-limited bicycle ergometric exercise was performed, 368 patients were randomly allocated to the parallel treatment groups. After 4 weeks of therapy with a low dose, a further exercise test was performed and patients were titrated in single-blind fashion to the higher dose if the increase in total exercise time was < 1 minute, and there was no safety concern. After a further 8 weeks of treatment a third exercise test was performed. Carvedilol low dose/high dose was shown to be at least as safe and well tolerated as metoprolol low dose/high dose both in younger and elderly patients. There were no hitherto unknown adverse events and no marked change in the types of events after increase of the doses. Early adverse events after treatment initiation or uptitration were equal with both medications, indicating no particular risk associated with carvedilol's vasodilatory action. No rebound phenomena were observed. Both drugs showed good antianginal and anti-ischemic efficacy, with marked increases on uptitration including patients > or = 65 years of age. However, in the doses selected, which appeared equipotent with respect to beta blockade, carvedilol's improvement of time to 1-mm ST-segment depression was statistically significantly greater than that of metoprolol. This could be due to its additional vasodilatory or antioxidative actions. Based on the safety and efficacy data of the present study, use of the higher of the 2 recommended doses of carvedilol and metoprolol appears justified in younger and elderly patients without adequate therapeutic control at lower doses.",I,I

Drugs for the treatment of CHF include vasodilators (ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers), diuretics, digoxin and beta-blockers. However, antiarrhythmic drugs are not currently recommended in the management of CHF with the exception of beta-blockers for which a favorable effect on the prognosis could be shown. Amiodarone is effective in the suppression of ventricular arrhythmias without a significant effect on total mortality. Implanted defibrillators are superior to antiarrhythmic drug therapy in prolonging survival among survivors of sudden cardiac death. They should be offered as firstline therapy in case of life-threatening ventricular tachy-arrhythmias.",1,E

The effects on chest pain and side-effects of the two treatments were followed during 24 h. Pain was assessed by a numerical rating scale.; A total of 265 patients were randomized in this prospective double-blind study and 59% developed a confirmed acute myocardial infarction. In both treatment groups, there were rapid reductions of pain intensity. However, in the patient group treated with morphine, there was a more pronounced pain relief during the first 80 min after start of double-blind treatment. The side-effects were few and were those expected from each therapeutic regimen. During the first 24 h, nausea requiring anti-emetics was more common in the morphine-treated patients.; In suspected acute myocardial infarction, if chest pain persists after intravenous beta-adrenergic blockade treatment, standard doses of an opioid analgesic such as morphine will offer better pain relief than increased dosages of metoprolol.",E,E

However, the value of ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension in renal allograft recipients has not been established. ACE inhibitors dilate the efferent glomerular arteriole, an effect that may aggravate the decrease in glomerular filtration rate resulting from cyclosporine-induced vasoconstriction at the afferent glomerular arteriole. Therefore, the goal of this double-blind, randomized study was to compare the antihypertensive and renal effects of the ACE inhibitor quinapril with those of the beta-blocker atenolol in renal allograft recipients in whom hypertension developed 6 to 12 weeks after transplantation. All patients received cyclosporine as an immunosuppressant and had stable graft function (serum creatinine concentration, <220 micromol/L) at entry into the study. Twenty-nine patients who received quinapril (daily dose titrated between 2.5 and 20 mg) and 30 patients who received atenolol (daily dose titrated between 12.5 and 100 mg) completed the 24-month study. The two groups did not differ in age, sex ratio, height, and weight before entry into the study. Quinapril decreased diastolic blood pressure from 96+/-1 to 84+/-1 mm Hg (average throughout treatment period), and atenolol decreased diastolic blood pressure from 96+/-1 to 83+/-1 mm Hg. The serum creatinine concentration did not change significantly in either group after 24 months (129+/-8 micromol/L at entry and 148+/-19 micromol/L after 24 months in the quinapril group and 131+/-6 micromol/L at entry and 152+/-15 micromol/L after 24 months in the atenolol group; P=NS for both groups). After 24 months, the change in urinary albumin excretion from baseline was -10+/-15 mg/d in the quinapril group and 52+/-32 mg/d in the atenolol group (P=0.03). These results show that quinapril and atenolol are effective antihypertensive drugs when used after renal transplantation. Moreover, compared with atenolol, quinapril has no adverse effects on graft function. The relative reduction in albuminuria observed with quinapril as compared with atenolol could indicate a beneficial effect of quinapril on long-term graft function.",E,E

The second goal will be the argument of the present paper. Two-hundred fifty < or = 75 years consecutive patients (mean age: 58 yrs, males = 203) with acute myocardial infarction were randomly allocated to receive for > or = 3 months captopril (up to 75 mg/day, Group 1), metoprolol (up to 200 mg/day, Group 2) or captopril + metoprolol (Group 3) starting in the first 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Intravenous beta-blockers in the acute phase of myocardial infarction and all other cardioactive drugs were allowed. The effect of the randomized therapy at six months from admission to the coronary care unit was considered in relation to: 1. recurrence of spontaneous cardiac events and of elective revascularization procedures; 2. adverse reactions (hypotension, atrioventricular block, cough, allergy, need of beta-blockers in Group 1, need for ACE inhibition in Group 2) requiring treatment modification based on physician's decision.; Definite follow-up data were available in 226 patients and 195/226 patients (86%) had a complete treatment period. In these patients (per protocol analysis), 37 spontaneous cardiac events occurred: cardiac death = 6, non-fatal reinfarction = 9, unstable angina requiring hospitalization = 16, congestive heart failure = 6. Moreover, seven patients received a coronary revascularization procedure. Events occurred in 11/67 patients from Group 1, 16/63 patients from Group 2, 10/65 patients from Group 3 (16% vs 25% vs 15%, p = 0.28). The multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated an increased odds ratio (OR) for spontaneous cardiac events in patients from Group 2 (OR = 2.82, 95% Cl: 1.16-6.87: p < 0.05). Elective revascularization procedures were statistically less frequent in patients treated with metoprolol (Group 1 = 9%, Group 2 = 1.6%, Group 3 = 0%; Group 1 vs Groups 2 and 3; p = 0.03). The intention-to-treat analysis on the overall population (226 patients) confirmed the presence of a trend towards a higher risk in patients from Group 2 (OR = 2.1, 95% Cl: 0.96-4.59; p = 0.06). Adverse reactions were observed in 16 patients from Group 1, 6 patients from Group 2 and 15 patients from Group 3 (22% vs 10% vs 23%; Group 2 vs Groups 1 and 3; p = 0.08). At the multivariate regression analysis, a trend towards less adverse reactions in patients assigned to the beta-blocker therapy alone was confirmed (OR = 0.41, 95% Cl: 0.15-1.13; p = 0.07).; In a randomized early post-infarction treatment strategy, ACE inhibition with captopril alone or in combination with metoprolol demonstrated an increased protection against spontaneous cardiac events at six months in comparison with metoprolol alone. On the other hand, the beta-blocker treatment was associated with a lower number of elective revascularization procedures and appeared better tolerated than ACE inhibition.",E,E

Carvedilol was commenced at 3.125 mg b.i.d. and titrated to 25 mg b.i.d. as tolerated. Patients with class IV symptoms were older (p = 0.03), had lower left ventricular fractional shortening (p < 0.001), had lower six-min walk distance (p < 0.001) and were receiving more heart failure medications at baseline compared with less symptomatic patients.; Nonfatal adverse events while taking carvedilol occurred more frequently in class IV patients (43% vs. 24%, p < 0.0001), and more often resulted in permanent withdrawal of the drug (25% vs. 13%, p < 0.01). Thirty-seven (59%) patients who were NYHA class IV at baseline had improved by one or more functional class at 3 months, 8 (13%) were unchanged and 18 (29%) had deteriorated or died. Among the less symptomatic group, 62 (37%) patients had improved their NYHA status at 3 months, 73 (44%) were unchanged and 32 (19%) had deteriorated or died. The differences in symptomatic outcome at three months between the two groups were statistically significant (p = 0.001, chi-square analysis). Both groups demonstrated similar significant improvements in left ventricular dimensions and systolic function.; Patients with chronic NYHA class IV heart failure are more likely to develop adverse events during initiation and dose titration when compared with less symptomatic patients but are more likely to show symptomatic improvement in the long term. We conclude that carvedilol is a useful adjunctive therapy for patients with NYHA class IV heart failure; however, they require close observation during initiation and titration of the drug.",E,E

All drugs were titrated to a diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or less. Both studies were double-blind, randomized, parallel dose escalation trials with similar designs and included three active treatments. The second study also had a placebo group. The mean change from baseline of systolic and diastolic blood pressure for placebo (n = 79) was -0. 1/-2.2 mm Hg; amlodipine (n = 154), -12.4/-10.3 mm Hg; enalapril (n = 155), -9.4/-8.2 mm Hg; and bisoprolol/HCTZ (n = 155), -14.0/-12.0. Overall efficacy analyses documented a statistically significant decrease in sitting diastolic blood pressure for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ compared with placebo, amlodipine, and enalapril. There was a significant reduction in sitting systolic blood pressure for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ compared with placebo and enalapril but not amlodipine.

This prospective, controlled trial included consecutive eligible patients who had large varices (>5 mm in diameter) that were at high risk for bleeding. The patients were assigned to either propranolol therapy, at a dose sufficient to decrease the base-line heart rate by 25 percent, or variceal ligation, to be performed weekly until the varices were obliterated or so reduced in size that it was not possible to continue treatment.; Of the 89 patients, 82 of whom had cirrhosis of the liver, 44 received propranolol and 45 underwent variceal ligation. The mean (+/-SD) duration of follow-up in each group was 14+/-9 and 13+/-10 months, respectively. The mean time required to achieve an adequate reduction in the heart rate was 2.5+/-1.7 days; the mean number of sessions needed to complete variceal ligation was 3.2+/-1.1. After 18 months, the actuarial probability of bleeding was 43 percent in the propranolol group and 15 percent in the ligation group (P=0.04). Twelve patients in the propranolol group and four in the ligation group had bleeding. Three of the four in the ligation group had bleeding before their varices had been obliterated. Nine patients in the ligation group had recurrent varices, a mean of 3.7 months after the initial treatment. Five patients in each group died; bleeding from the varices was the cause of death of four patients in the propranolol group and of three in the ligation group. There were no serious complications of variceal ligation; in the propranolol group, treatment was stopped in two patients because of side effects.; In patients with high-risk esophageal varices, endoscopic ligation of the varices is safe and more effective than propranolol for the primary prevention of variceal bleeding.",I,E

Furthermore, it remains unclear whether chronic treatment with antihypertensive agents modulates levels of AVP, with potential secondary effects on vascular tone and fluid homeostasis.; To investigate the relation between plasma AVP and arterial blood pressure in a population-based sample of 534 middle-aged subjects.; Overall, levels of AVP were higher in hypertensive subjects (2.15 +/- 0.26 pg/ml; n = 289) than in normotensive subjects (1.45 +/- 0.15 pg/ml; n = 245; P < 0.05). (Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 95 mmHg, or receiving antihypertensive medication.) In untreated individuals, plasma levels of AVP were found to be correlated with both systolic (r = 0.15, P = 0.002) and diastolic (r = 0.14, P = 0.005) blood pressure. The differences between the lowest and highest quartile of AVP levels were 5.1 mmHg (P = 0.03) and 2.6 mmHg (NS) for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, after adjustment for age and sex. Moreover, it appeared that the relation between AVP and blood pressure was particularly strong in subjects with low levels of renin (< 10 mU/l; n = 118; systolic blood pressure r = 0.24, P = 0.007; diastolic blood pressure r = 0.19, P = 0.03). Specifically, patients receiving monotherapy with diuretics (n = 39) or beta-blockers (n = 54) displayed elevated plasma levels of AVP (2.93 +/- 0.98 pg/ml and 2.74 +/- 0.74 pg/ml respectively); however, only in patients taking diuretics was this finding apparently independent of confounding variables. Other monotherapies with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 9) or Ca(2+)-antagonists (n = 19) were not associated with levels of AVP.; The data suggest that plasma levels of AVP display a discernible relationship with arterial blood pressure and hypertension, particularly when renin levels are low. In addition, with the exception of diuretics, no modulation of AVP levels is attributable to the intake of antihypertensive agents as it occurs in a population-based sample.",E,E

Because the genesis of LVH appears to be multifactorial, antihypertensive treatment should aim to reduce not only pressor values but also the hypertrophic ventricular mass. This result can be obtained only when drugs able to act on both pathogenetic factors are used. To evaluate the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy on regression of LVH, 21 patients with stage 2 essential hypertension were treated for a year with either atenolol (120 mg/d orally), a cardioselective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, or ramipril (5 mg/d orally), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with high tissue activity. Both treatments produced significant control of hypertension and regression of LVH. No statistically significant difference between treatments was noted, except for heart rate, which was substantially unchanged by ramipril but significantly decreased by atenolol. Both drugs were well tolerated. Atenolol and ramipril have a major role in the long-term treatment of hypertension and in the regression of hypertension-associated LVH.",E,E

We identified adult patients meeting contact criteria and with diagnosis of CHF by International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) coding and assessed prescribed therapy as well as select comorbid conditions. Drugs of interest included those with known or suspected benefit or detriment and those with unproven benefit. An eligible group of 14,983 patients was identified, from which a cohort of 148 patients with CHF was selected. Forty-one percent of these 148 patients were prescribed an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, 34% digoxin, 12% diuretic, 12% hydralazine + nitrate, 20% inhaled beta-agonists, and 66% warfarin.

In general, recommended therapies for CHF appeared underutilized in this cohort, whereas those of unclear benefit and potential detriment appeared overutilized.

Heart rate variability is a non-invasive tool to estimate cardiac autonomic tone. The aim was to study changes of heart rate variability in patients with congestive heart failure on placebo, on the beta1-selective antagonist metoprolol or 24 h after metoprolol withdrawal. Forty-five patients with congestive heart failure were studied with Holter recordings. Heart rate variability measurements were performed before, after 6-12 months of treatment with 150 mg metoprolol/placebo, or 24 h after discontinued metoprolol. After treatment, patients on beta-blockade had a significantly longer mean RR interval and changes of heart rate variability, suggesting elevated vagal tone. Patients monitored in the rebound phase of beta-blocker withdrawal had a significant vagal reduction to the level of the placebo group. There was also a nonsignificant trend towards increased sympathetic tone (LF/HF over 24 h), compared with the beta-blockade group. Heart rate variability indicates an elevated vagal tone during treatment with metoprolol but beta-blockade withdrawal shifts the autonomic balance towards lower vagal and higher sympathetic tone within 24 h. These results could imply a potential risk when abruptly discontinuing beta-blockade medication in these patients.",E,E

The study group consisted of 33 patients (age 45 to 63 years) with poor BP control who received randomized metoprolol or enalapril monotherapy. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was assessed by phenylephrine test and time- and frequency-domain measurements of heart rate variability (HRV) were analyzed from 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings during monotherapy and after 10 weeks of combination therapy with metoprolol + felodipine or enalaril + hydrochlorothiazide to lower casual BP to < 140/90 mm Hg.

Patients on carvedilol were assumed to experience a reduced risk of death and hospitalization for CHF, which is consistent with findings from the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program. The benefits of carvedilol were projected under 2 alternative scenarios. In the first (""limited benefits""), benefits were conservatively assumed to persist for 6 months, the average duration of follow-up in these clinical trials, and then end abruptly. In the other (""extended benefits""), they were arbitrarily assumed to persist for 6 months and then decline gradually over time, vanishing by the end of 3 years. We estimated our model using data from the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program and other sources. For patients receiving conventional therapy alone, estimated life expectancy was 6.67 years; corresponding figures for those also receiving carvedilol were 6.98 and 7.62 years under the limited and extended benefits scenarios, respectively. Expected lifetime costs of CHF-related care were estimated to be $28,756 for conventional therapy, and $36,420 and $38,867 for carvedilol (limited and extended benefits, respectively). Cost per life-year saved for carvedilol was $29,477 and $12,799 under limited and extended benefits assumptions, respectively.

BP was recorded intra-arterially directly from the brachial artery before and during submaximal exercise. BRS was determined by the phenylephrine injection technique. MAP and its variability were determined for the awake period of 24-h BP monitoring. Subjects were randomised to one of atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol, or propranolol, and restudied after a mean of 5 months. Beta-blockade increased BRS in 24 patients and decreased BRS in 11. BRS increased from 6.53+/-4.94 to 9.40+/-8.62 ms/mm Hg (mean +/- s.d.) (P<0.01). Waking ambulatory MAP decreased from 125.8+/-15.8 to 106.4+/-16.2 mm Hg (P<0.0001), but its variability did not change. Higher BRS after chronic beta-blockade was associated with a decrease in waking ambulatory MAP (r = -0.55, P<0.001), but not with its variability (r = -0.08). Beta-blockade attenuated the pressor response to exercise, but there was a positive relationship between the effect of beta-blockade on BRS, and on the rise in systolic BP during bicycling (r = 0.63; P<0.001). Any dampening effect of beta-blockade on BP variability at rest in hypertensive patients with the greatest increase in BRS may be offset by increased pressor responses to physical activity such as exercise. Consequently, BP variability is unaffected, even though reductions in ambulatory BP during chronic beta-blockade are inversely related to changes in BRS. BP responses to beta-blockade may be a function of the action of this class of drugs on BRS. However, there is considerable variation, between subjects, in their effect on BRS. This may have implications for other conditions, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, or following myocardial infarction, in which improvement in BRS is one mechanism by which beta-adrenoceptor blockade could improve survival.",E,E

This improvement in LV function has also been shown to be associated with an improvement in survival. This study evaluates the effect of carvedilol on LV mass, geometry, and degree of mitral regurgitation (MR). In 59 patients with symptomatic heart failure and LV ejection fraction <0.35, previously randomized to either treatment with carvedilol or placebo, we evaluated LV mass, geometry, and degree of MR over the time period of carvedilol treatment. LV mass decreased as early as 4 months into the treatment protocol and continued to decrease over a period of 1 year. LV geometry, defined by the length/diameter ratio, and severity of MR also improved with 4 months of therapy. Thus, compared with placebo treatment, carvedilol decreases LV mass while improving cardiac geometry and decreasing MR in patients with chronic heart failure. These changes occur in association with an improvement in LV systolic function. This process begins by 4 months of treatment and continues for 12 months.",E,E

We studied 152 subjects with essential hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >90 mm Hg], total cholesterol (TC) >240 and <330 mg/dl, and triglycerides (TGs) <300 mg/dl. After a 4-week washout period with placebo, patients were randomized to receive propranolol, 160 mg/day (n = 37), atenolol, 100 mg/day (n = 38), bisoprolol, 10 mg/day (n = 39), or celiprolol, 400 mg/day (n = 38), for 18 months. No cholesterol-reducing drug was allowed. Blood samples for evaluation of TC, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and TGs were taken before and after the placebo period and subsequently every 6 months. No beta-blocker worsened TC or LDL-C. Nonselective propranolol caused the most pronounced changes in HDL-C and TGs. Beta1-Selective atenolol produced the same qualitative effects, but to a lesser extent. The more beta1-selective bisoprolol did not affect HDL-C and TGs. Celiprolol significantly improved the lipid profile by significantly decreasing TC, LDL-C, and TGs, and increasing HDL-C. These findings suggest that in hypercholesterolemic hypertensive patients, (a) beta1-selective beta-blockers are likely to adversely affect plasma lipids to a lesser extent than nonselective ones; and (b) celiprolol is able to improve the lipid pattern, which could be because of its peculiar ancillary properties.",I,I

Clinical problems related to elderly patients and multifaceted aspects of multidisciplinary approaches of medical care to these particular patients are also discussed with special emphasis on the aspect of improved quality of life associated with reduced mortality. Concepts of CHF have greatly changed over the past decades with regard to its pathophysiology, natural progression, mechanisms, causes of death, arrhythmias and treatment goals. Although the current most frequent aetiologies of CHF include coronary heart disease and dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension has been revisited in a different way, and has been considered of pivotal importance in most recent trends and possibly in future perspectives. Nowadays, however, with the results of improved survival, alleviation of symptoms, improvement in functional capacity and prevention of associated complications including even left ventricular remodelling through various appropriate pharmacotherapies, patients with CHF are used to being physically and psychosocially more active than ever before. Thus, improvement of patients' quality of life and reduction of mortality have become of prime importance in achieving treatment goals. Another emerging aspect of CHF is aging itself, and special features in the medical care of elderly patients with CHF always have to be taken into consideration in reduction of hospital readmission along with improvement of morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in the treatment of CHF, it remains a common disease with a poor prognosis. Therefore, this review focuses on what we should be trying to achieve in reaching goals to reduce repeated hospital readmission and mortality, and increase social activity and quality of life, especially in elderly patients with CHF. In these clinical settings, educational strategies for patients and their family members should be emphasised. Multidisciplinary interventions by nurses and possibly other contributions from a widely available social support system might be effective in preventing repeated hospital readmissions of elderly patients with CHF. In this regard, special precautions have to be paid in the management of elderly patients to achieve effective treatment goals, and any treatment strategy has to be appropriately determined through a comprehensive assessment of patient clinical profiles. Multidisciplinary approaches to these problems have to be effectively utilised to improve patients' quality of life, while possibly reducing medical expenses.",E,E

Clinical evaluation, therapy, and monitoring for hypertension are modeled with an incidence-based Markov model. Clinical inputs include agent efficacy, side effects, and compliance with dosing schedules. JNC-recommended clinical and laboratory monitoring schedules are followed for each agent. Switches between classes occur for therapeutic failures. Drug and medical care costs are valued in 1995 US dollars.; Although patients whose hypertension was initially treated with amlodipine achieved control more readily than patients who were given the other agents, the initial costs to achieve and maintain hypertension control were lowest for chlorthalidone ($641), followed by acebutolol ($920), amlodipine ($946), and enalapril ($948). Maintenance costs were lowest for chlorthalidone. For all agents except chlorthalidone, drug costs were the largest component of overall costs, followed by the costs of office visits, laboratory monitoring, and switching between classes for therapeutic failures.; By following JNC guidelines, a slightly higher percentage of patients will achieve hypertension control with a newer class calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) but at a substantially higher cost than with a generic diuretic (chlorthalidone).",E,E

It is devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilising activity but appears to have nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatory effects. Nebivolol is administered as a racemic mixture of equal proportions of d- and l-enantiomers. The drug does not significantly influence glucose or plasma lipid metabolism and appears to have a protective effect on left ventricular function. At the recommended dosage (5 mg once daily) nebivolol reduces resting diastolic blood pressure as effectively as standard therapeutic dosages of atenolol, metoprolol, lisinopril and nifedipine, as shown in comparative trials. Nebivolol reduced blood pressure significantly more than enalapril 10 mg daily in the short but not the long term, although the enalapril dose may not have been optimal. Nebivolol has an additive effect in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Standing blood pressure and/or mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure is significantly and similarly reduced with nebivolol, atenolol or nifedipine. Nebivolol tended to prevent increases in early morning blood pressure better than nifedipine. Overall response rates to nebivolol therapy (a decrease in sitting/supine diastolic blood pressure to < or = 90 mm Hg or a 10% or > or = 10 mm Hg fall in diastolic blood pressure) ranged from 58 to 81% after 4 to 52 weeks' treatment. In comparative studies, response rates were greater in nebivolol than in enalapril or metoprolol recipients, but not significantly different from those in atenolol or nifedipine recipients. Nebivolol 5 mg once daily is well tolerated in patients with hypertension. Adverse events are infrequent, transient and mild to moderate. Those reported most often include headache, fatigue, paraesthesias and dizziness. Several studies reported no signs of orthostatic hypotension with nebivolol. Comparative trials revealed no significant differences between the frequency and severity of adverse events in patients receiving nebivolol, atenolol, enalapril or placebo; however, the overall incidence of adverse events was greater with nifedipine or metoprolol. Some atenolol or enalapril, but not nebivolol, recipients reported impotence or decreased libido during therapy.; Current evidence indicates that nebivolol 5 mg once daily is a well tolerated beta-blocker, which is as effective as once daily atenolol and other classes of antihypertensive agents. It may therefore be recommended as a useful alternative first-line treatment option for the management of patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension.",E,E

Herein, we report final results from an extended sample size.; Drug-free outpatients with a major depressive episode were randomized in a double-blind manner to one of two treatment conditions: fluoxetine (20 mg daily) with pindolol (7.5 to 10 mg daily) or fluoxetine (20 mg daily) with placebo. After 6 weeks, patients were followed for 3 more weeks in a single-blind manner, on fluoxetine and placebo pindolol.; Eighty-six patients completed at least 1 or more weeks on protocol, with 45 and 41 patients randomized to the pindolol and placebo groups respectively. After 2 weeks on protocol, partial remission (i.e., at least 50% decrease in depression rating scores from baseline) rates for pindolol (16%) and placebo (19%) groups were comparable. By the study's end, a partial remission was achieved, at least transiently, for 67% of the pindolol group and 80% of the placebo group. Pindolol treatment was associated with statistically significant reduction in blood pressure and pulse as compared to the control group. The two groups did not have overall differences in rates of attrition, time to response, and side effects.; In accord with our previously published findings, these extended results do not support the efficacy of pindolol in hastening clinical response to fluoxetine in a patient population with predominantly chronic and recurrent depression.",E,E

A double-blind, randomised parallel group study (2:1 fashion) was conducted over 4-week period. The propranolol group (n = 9) received 20 mg (week 1 and 2) and 30 mg (week 3 and 4) twice daily, and the other group (n = 5) a matched placebo for 4 weeks. Patients included had experienced at least two severe hypoglycaemic episodes (coma or seizures) during the previous year, which were characterised by a lack of adrenergic symptoms and required the assistance of another person. The mean number of hypoglycaemias during the study period was similar in both groups (placebo: 13 +/- 2 propranolol: 11 +/- 1), whereas the number of totally asymptomatic hypoglycaemias (< 0.6 g/l) was lower on propranolol than on placebo (3 +/- 1 vs 8 +/- 3, NS) and the number of symptomatic hypoglycaemias was higher (7.2 +/- 2 vs 4.6 +/- 1, NS). Subjective evaluation of treatment by the investigators showed 0/5 successes in the placebo group and 5/9 in the propranolol group (chi2 = 4.32, p = 0.038). The main advantage of propranolol over placebo was an increased incidence of sweating. The ratio [number of hypoglycaemias with sweating/total number of hypoglycaemias] being higher with propranolol (0.28 +/- 0.08 vs 0.06 +/- 0.02, p = 0.06). This pilot study suggests that beta-blockers may be useful in restoring adrenergic symptoms during hypoglycaemia in insulin-dependent diabetic patients without warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia. This beneficial effect seems to be predominantly related to an increase in hypoglycaemia-induced sweating. A larger study is needed to confirm or invalidate these preliminary results.",E,E

Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that beta-blockers slow down the progression of left ventricular dilatation that characterizes heart failure. In addition changes in left ventricular ejection fraction after several months of beta-blocker treatment appears to have predictive value for survival. This beneficial effect of beta-blockade in chronic heart failure needs to be assessed further. The presumed benefit of beta-blockade with betaxolol (CAS 63659-18-7), a highly selective beta-blocker with long duration of action in chronic heart failure (CHF) will be assessed in BETACAR, a comparative study versus carvedilol (CAS 72956-09-3).

Investigations of spontaneous heart rate and of matched paced heart rates were performed at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months of follow-up by radionuclide angiography. There were significant signs of improvement in systolic indices of the spontaneous heart rate in the metoprolol-treated group (peak ejection rate: 0.98 to 1.32 end-diastolic volume.s-1, P = 0.015) as compared to placebo (1.14 to 1.19 end-diastolic volume.s-1, not significant).

No effects were observed in the early peak filling rate. Left ventricular volumes decreased during metoprolol treatment, both for the spontaneous heart rate and during matched pacing.; These data imply that beta-blocker treatment improves the force-frequency relationship of myocardial performance.

Although the second-generation compound metoprolol is beta1-selective, the third-generation compound carvedilol is beta-nonselective, with ancillary pharmacological properties including alpha-blockade and antioxidant effects. A prospective comparison of these 2 agents can address the issue of optimal adrenergic blockade in selecting agents for therapy in CHF.; Sixty-seven patients with symptomatic stable heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either carvedilol or metoprolol in addition to standard therapy for CHF. Measured variables included symptoms, exercise, ejection fraction, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) as an indirect marker of free radical activity. Metoprolol and carvedilol were well tolerated, and both patient groups showed beneficial effects of beta-blocker therapy in each of the measured parameters, with no between-group differences. Ejection fraction increased over 6 months from 18+/-6.3% to 23+/-8.7% (P<0.005) with metoprolol and from 19+/-8.5% to 25+/-9.9% (P<0.0005) with carvedilol (P=NS between groups).

This study quantifies the effects of beta-blockade on the RAAS and examines its impact on prorenin processing by measuring changes in the ratio of plasma renin activity (PRA) to total renin. In normotensive (N = 14) and hypertensive (N = 16) subjects, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, PRA, plasma prorenin, plasma total renin (prorenin + PRA), ratio of PRA to total renin (%PRA), plasma Ang II, and urinary aldosterone were measured before and after 1 week of beta-blockade. Plasma renin activity, Ang II, and urinary aldosterone levels were similar for normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Plasma renin activity correlated with Ang II. Total renin, which is proportional to (pro)renin gene expression, was lower in hypertensive subjects and was inversely related to BP. Beta-blockade decreased BP and heart rate in both groups, with medium- and high-renin hypertensive subjects responding more frequently than those with low renin. Beta-blockade consistently suppressed PRA, Ang II, and aldosterone. Total renin was unchanged, thus, %PRA fell. These results indicate that beta-blockers suppress plasma angiotensin II levels, in parallel with the marked reductions in PRA and urinary aldosterone levels in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. The suppression of Ang II levels was comparable to that produced during angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. However, by reducing prorenin processing to renin, beta-blockers do not stimulate renin secretion, unlike ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists. This unique action of beta-blockers has important implications for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.",E,E

We undertook a crossover rotation of the four main classes of antihypertensive drugs, in untreated young hypertensive patients, to assess the response rate with monotherapy achieved by a systematic rotation.; 56 patients, mean blood pressure 161/98 mm Hg, entered the rotation, of whom 36 received all four monthly cycles of treatment with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (A), beta-blocker (B), calcium-channel blocker (C), and diuretic (D). Each patient's best drug was then repeated to assess repeatability. Two measures of individual variability in response were used. First, the value of rotation was measured by the increased proportion of patients reaching target blood pressure on their best drug versus their first drug. Second, we assessed whether the responses to each drug were correlated with each other.; Significant variability in response was found. 20 of the 41 patients reaching target blood pressure (< or =140/90 mm Hg) failed to achieve this target on their first drug. Rotation increased from 22/56 (39%) to 41/56 (73%) the success of monotherapy (p=0.0001); in half the patients, blood-pressure on the best treatment was 135/85 mm Hg or less. There were significant correlations between the blood pressure responses to A and B (r=0.5, p<0.01), and C and D (r=0.6, p<0.001), but not between the other four pairings of treatments. The responses to the AB pair were, on average, at least 50% higher than those to the CD pair; this difference was highly significant by multivariate repeated-measures ANOVA.; There is a marked variability in hypertensive patients' response to different antihypertensive drugs. The basis may be underlying variability in types of essential hypertension. Optimisation of treatment requires systematic rotation through several therapies; however, an ""AB/CD"" rule is proposed in which one of each of the two pairs of treatments is initially selected to abbreviate the rotation in routine practice.",E,E

Cardiovascular autonomic control was assessed using frequency domain measures of heart rate variability during the spontaneous and controlled breathing tests. During orthostatic maneuver and cold pressor test the blood pressure variability analysis also was performed.; In general, the responses of heart rate and blood pressure variabilities were abnormal in the patients with arterial hypertension and sleep apnea syndrome compared to reference data. Of the four drugs, only atenolol effected heart rate and blood pressure variabilities as it shifted the autonomic regulation to the vagal direction. Other antihypertensive drugs did not change any parameter of heart rate or blood pressure variabilities.; The short-term treatment with atenolol in patients with arterial hypertension and sleep apnea syndrome is associated with normalization of autonomic nervous control judged by heart rate and blood pressure variability. Thus, beta-receptor blockade may have adjunctive beneficial effects beyond blood pressure reduction in these patients. However, the long-term effects of blood pressure reduction on autonomic nervous control remain to be studied.",E,E

The aim of this study was to investigate whether carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker with anti-alpha1-adrenergic activity, may cause a greater HVPG reduction than propranolol. Thirty-five cirrhotic patients had hemodynamic measurements before and after the random administration of carvedilol (n = 14), propranolol (n = 14), or placebo (n = 7). Carvedilol markedly reduced HVPG, from 19.5 +/- 1.3 to 15.4 +/- 1 mm Hg (P <.0001). This HVPG reduction was greater than after propranolol (-20.4 +/- 2 vs. -12.7 +/- 2%, P <.05). Moreover, carvedilol decreased HVPG greater than 20% of baseline values or to </=12 mm Hg in a greater proportion of patients (64% vs. 14%, P <.05). Both drugs caused similar reductions in hepatic and azygos blood flows, suggesting that the greater HVPG decrease by carvedilol was because of reduced hepatic and portocollateral resistance. Propranolol caused greater reductions in heart rate and cardiac output than carvedilol, whereas carvedilol caused a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure (-23.1 vs. -11%, P <.05). Thus, carvedilol has a greater portal hypotensive effect than propranolol in patients with cirrhosis, suggesting a greater therapeutic potential. However, it causes arterial hypotension, which calls for careful evaluation before its long-term use.",E,E

The question was also studied if they way in which this blood glucose control was achieved and the way of treating the blood pressure affected the prognosis. Blood glucose control was found to reduce the incidence of--especially--microvascular complications. Oral hypoglycaemic agents and insulin both play an important part in achieving good control.

Analysis of temporal trends suggests beneficial changes in practice patterns and outcomes are possible to achieve. However, ""best care"" has not been rapidly or completely achieved. Review of strategies to close these care gaps suggests that audit and feedback, critical pathways, and multifactorial interventions involving patients and other members of the healthcare team as well as physicians may be the most efficacious strategies for change.; Despite equal or enhanced efficacy, there is consistently less prescription of proven drugs among older cardiac patients. These care patterns may contribute to their enhanced risk. The causes underlying these practice patterns are complex, and their population impact may be undervalued by clinicians and managers.

A common silent polymorphism (ATT-->ATC, Ile(131)) was identified in exon 5 of the G(s)alpha gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. This polymorphism consists of the presence (+) or absence (-) of a restriction site for FokI. Only 1 other rare allele was found in the coding region; the high GC content of the 5' noncoding sequence prevented mutation scanning of the promoter region of the gene. There was a significant difference in frequency of the FokI alleles between 268 white hypertensives (FokI+:FokI-, 51%:49%) and a matched group of 231 control subjects (FokI+:FokI-, 58%:42%) (P=0.02). Multiple regression analysis showed that the FokI genotype was independently related to the level of untreated systolic blood pressure in 294 well-characterized white hypertensives (P=0.01) but not in normotensives. The influence of the FokI allele on blood pressure (BP) response to beta-blockade was examined in 114 of the patients randomly assigned to this class of drug. Significant differences in frequency of the FokI allele were observed in the good responders (FokI+:FokI-, 62.5%:37.5%, n=36) versus the poor responders (FokI+:FokI-, 41.7%:58.3%, n=30) after beta-blocker therapy (P=0.02).

All these variables have been shown to predict vascular events. The patients were not taking lipid-lowering drugs; hypertension was present in 156 (31.7%) of them. Of the hypertensive patients, 52 (33%) were not receiving any treatment to control their blood pressure. This omission was not due to a lower prevalence of established vascular disease. The treated hypertensives were divided into three groups according to their treatment: 62 were taking lipid-hostile antihypertensives (beta-blockers, thiazides), 37 were taking lipid-neutral antihypertensives (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, Ca-channel blockers, angiotensin II receptor blockers, indapamide sustained release), and five were taking lipid-friendly antihypertensives (doxazosin). Lipid-hostile antihypertensive drugs were associated with a significantly higher fibrinogen concentration when compared with untreated hypertensives or those taking lipid-neutral/lipid-friendly drugs (median values: 383, 353, and 336 mg/dL, respectively; P < .01). Lipid-neutral/lipid-friendly antihypertensive drugs were associated with lower Lp(a) levels when compared with untreated hypertensives (median values: 22 and 45 mg/dL, respectively; P < .05). The serum bilirubin level was significantly lower in the untreated hypertensives when compared with normotensives or the treated hypertensives. There were no significant differences in lipids, glucose, or albumin among the groups of hypertensives or normotensives. The influence of antihypertensive drugs on additional cardiovascular risk factors should be considered when selecting medication to reduce blood pressure.",E,E

Despite this, there is little evidence that inhibition of endogenous bradykinin breakdown actually contributes to the effects of ACE inhibitors, or indeed, other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin II type I receptor (AT(1)) antagonists, and no evidence at all that it does so in patients with heart failure.; Twelve patients with heart failure (11 male, 1 female, ages 59 to 81 years) were randomized to double-blind crossover treatment with enalapril 10 mg BID followed by losartan 25 mg BID, or the reverse, each for 5 weeks. At the end of each treatment period, forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography during an intrabrachial infusion of bradykinin before and after an intrabrachial infusion of Hoe-140 (a potent, selective, and long-acting bradykinin antagonist). Bradykinin caused profound vasodilatation after enalapril (peak, 357+/-67%) and less after losartan (peak, 230+/-46%). Despite this, Hoe-140 had no discernible effects after enalapril or losartan. Similarly, this was despite the finding that Hoe-140 significantly reduced vasodilatation to bradykinin after enalapril (peak, 192+/-35%) and losartan (peak, 66+/-13%).; Inhibition of endogenous bradykinin breakdown does not appear to contribute to the effects of ACE inhibition or AT(1) antagonism in the forearm of patients with heart failure at rest, despite the very obvious effects of ACE inhibition compared with AT(1) antagonism on exogenous bradykinin.",E,E

We examined 50 hypertensive patients randomized to receive 20 mg fosinopril or 50 mg atenolol daily for 16 weeks. ACE activity was measured in biopsy specimens from skeletal muscle. Measurements of office and ambulatory blood pressure, serum ACE, and left ventricular wall thickness were also performed. The same investigations were performed in a cross-sectional study of 50 healthy elderly men. Muscle ACE correlated inversely to blood pressure in cross-sectional analyses in both populations (p < 0.05). During atenolol treatment muscle ACE activity tended to increase (14%, p = 0.059), and this increase correlated inversely to the changes in standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.62, p = 0.0044, and r = 0.54, p = 0.016, respectively). Muscle ACE was also inversely correlated to left ventricular wall thickness when the two populations were pooled (r =-0.29, p = 0.0053). In the fosinopril group, muscle ACE activity was not different during treatment than at baseline (-2. 1%, p = 0.68). The inverse relationship between blood pressure and muscle ACE levels in this study indicate that muscle tissue ACE levels are influenced by haemodynamic factors in humans.",E,E

Patients were to be treated with bedrest, anti-ischaemic medications, aspirin, and heparin, and were to undergo risk-stratifying tests, consisting of an exercise test with ECG and thallium scintigraphy, scheduled to be performed within 3 days prior to, or 5 days after, hospital discharge and 24 h Holter monitoring scheduled to begin 2-5 days after randomization. Baseline clinical and ECG characteristics were compared between patients who 'failed' medical therapy and those who did not 'fail'. Failure was defined using clinical end-points (death, myocardial infarction, or spontaneous ischaemia by 6 weeks after randomization) or a strongly positive risk-stratifying test. For each test an ordered failure profile of results was calculated and consisted of death, myocardial infarction, or rest ischaemia occurring prior to performance of the test, a markedly abnormal test result, and no abnormality.; Clinical end-points occurred in 241 (33%) patients and were more likely to occur in patients who at presentation were older, had ST-segment depression on the qualifying ECG, or were being treated with heparin or aspirin. Characteristics independently predictive of developing a clinical event or an abnormal exercise treadmill test included: ST-segment depression on the qualifying ECG, history of prior angina, family history of premature coronary disease (i.e. onset <55 years of age), prior use of heparin or aspirin, and increasing age. By combining these baseline risk characteristics for each outcome the incidence of developing a clinical event ranged from 8% if none was present to 63% if all six were present, and of developing a markedly abnormal risk stratifying test from 8-21% if none were present to approximately 90% if all six were present.; Baseline characteristics associated with developing a clinical event or a markedly abnormal risk stratifying test were similar: rest anginal episode accompanied by ST-segment depression and occurring despite treatment with aspirin and heparin, a history of angina, older age, and family history of coronary disease. Patients with these characteristics are appropriate candidates for expeditious cardiac catheterization and consideration for revascularization, while patients without them may be suitable for medical management alone.",E,E

However, felodipine-metoprolol reduced all average blood pressures (24-h, day- and night-time) more than amlodipine (for 24-h average blood pressure 14.4/9.5 mmHg and 8.9/5.5 mmHg, respectively). Medians of individual diastolic trough-to-peak (T/P) ratios were similar for felodipine-metoprolol and amlodipine (54 and 50%, respectively), while for the systolic T/P ratios, the corresponding values were 74 and 35%, repectively; no significant difference between treatments was seen. As distinguished from amlodipine, both heart rate and rate pressure product were markedly decreased on felodipine-metoprolol throughout the 24-h period and even during the early morning hours. In general, both treatments were well tolerated.; Both felodipine-metoprolol and amlodipine achieved optimal control of blood pressure during the inter-dosing interval in line with their pharmokinetic profiles. The vasodilatory adverse events were slightly more reported with felodipine-metoprolol combination, but due to more pronounced lowering of the average blood pressures and the potent additional effect on heart rate and rate pressure product, the efficacy/tolerability balance seems to be equal to or better than that obtained with monotherapy such as amlodipine.",E,E

It has been suggested that some recently developed antihypertensive agents do not affect quality of life by causing adverse effects. We compared the effects of two antihypertensive drugs on quality of life: atenolol, a standard cardioselective beta-blocker, and celiprolol, one of a new class of selective beta-blockers with vasodilatory properties. One hundred thirty-two patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were eligible to enter a 28-week, double-blind, parallel-group study. The study protocol consisted of a 4-week period on placebo and a 24-week period of dosage-adjusted treatment with either atenolol or celiprolol. We assessed both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and quality of life perception by a selected test battery that included the Bulpitt and Fletcher Quality of Life Questionnaire. Supine blood pressure fell from 167/101 (range 120/95 to 200/116) to 150/92 mm Hg (p < 0. 0001) during celiprolol treatment. This antihypertensive effect was at least as good with celiprolol as with atenolol. Quality of life perception was comparable for the two drugs although adverse effects were seen more frequently with atenolol than with celiprolol, particularly after prolonged treatment. Patient compliance was better for celiprolol than for atenolol. Our results show that the selective beta-blocker with vasodilatory property celiprolol is at least as effective as atenolol and that it is more advantageous in terms of some quality of life variables.",I,E

Normometabolic subjects with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were recruited for this study, which included a 4-week, single-blind placebo washout phase and a 12-week double-blind treatment phase. After 12 weeks of treatment, both drugs demonstrated a significant decrease from baseline in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) apolipoprotein A-I (HDL-apoA-I) (nebivolol, P <.02; atenolol, P <.05). A significant reduction in HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) from baseline was also observed with nebivolol (P <.05). There were no significant differences between the drugs for these parameters, and the ratio low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-to-HDL-C did not change significantly after 12 weeks of active treatment with nebivolol or atenolol.

No significant differences in plasma apoA-I and apoC-III as well as in apoA-I-, C-III-containing lipoprotein particles (including the apoC-III ratio) were observed between the drugs, neither before nor after each active treatment. There were no significant differences between the drugs or within each treatment group in plasma glucose, insulin, or C-peptide concentrations after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Mean clinic trough sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) significantly decreased from 150/98 mm Hg at baseline to 141/90 mm Hg at termination for nebivolol and from 160/99 mm Hg at baseline to 145/88 mm Hg at termination for atenolol. No significant between-treatment differences were observed for the mean clinic trough sitting SBP/DBP. Both drugs significantly increased the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) N-terminal plasma levels, whereas no changes were observed in ANF C-terminal plasma concentrations.

Pooled estimates were computed according to a random-effects model.; A total of 750 patients were included in 11 trials. No significant heterogeneity was found for any of the outcomes. Pooled risk differences were recurrent bleeding, -31% (95% CI, -39%, -23%); encephalopathy, +16% (95% CI, +10%, +22%); death due to all causes, +2% (95% CI, -4%, +9%); and death due to bleeding, -5% (95% CI, -11%, +6%). Clinically important complications occurred in 22% of patients and were associated with both treatments. TIPS dysfunction occurred in 55% of patients.; TIPS creation markedly reduces risk of rebleeding but increases risk of encephalopathy without affecting survival.

The use of other antihypertensive medication (calcium antagonists or beta-blockers), however, was related to a reduced risk of Alzheimer disease (adjusted relative risk, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-1.2) only in the subpopulation with a higher baseline blood pressure (n = 458). Patients with dementia at baseline who were not taking diuretics had a 2-fold faster rate of decline in the score on the Mini-Mental State Examination than those taking diuretics.; The use of diuretics may protect against dementia in elderly persons.",E,E

Relatively few head-to-head comparative studies between fixed-dose combinations and first-line monotherapies for hypertension have been published. The objective of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of various first-line monotherapies and the fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/benazepril. The results of the meta-analysis were used to compare the efficacy and safety of the first-line monotherapies with amlodipine/benazepril. The meta-analysis included 82 studies that included 110 treatment groups (cohorts). The study compared nine different monotherapies and one combination therapy (amlodipine/benazepril). Of the 82 studies, 22 were placebo-controlled and 60 were active treatment controlled. The mean absolute decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) ranged from 9.7 to 13.3 mm Hg with verapamil showing the greatest effect and captopril the least (13.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg; 9.7 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, respectively). When studies were weighted by sample size, atenolol, verapamil, lisinopril and amlodipine/benazepril showed the greatest BP effect. When studies were weighted by variance, amlodipine/benazepril and atenolol showed the greatest BP effect. The percentage of patients controlled on therapy ranged from 54% to 79%. Lisinopril and amlodipine/benazepril showed the greatest percent controlled. The overall incidence of adverse effects ranged from 12.1% to 41.8% with lisinopril having the lowest and nifedipine having the highest incidence. The overall incidence of adverse effects resulting in drug discontinuance ranged from 1.3% to 10.7%, with amlodipine/benazepril having the lowest and nifedipine having the highest incidence. The results of the meta-analysis indicate that amlodipine/benazepril produces above average reductions in BP with a lower than average incidence of overall side effects and the lowest incidence of adverse effects resulting in drug discontinuance. The fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/benazepril achieves its goal of effective BP lowering with a minimum of significant side effects.",I,E

The Research Group for ""Guidelines on the Treatment of Hypertension in the Elderly"" collaborated with the Comprehensive Research Projects on Aging and Health group of the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan in performing a 3-year survey on the outcome of 700 hypertensive elderly outpatients (> or = 60 years) receiving treatment of antihypertensive drugs. Antihypertensive drugs including dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitors, diltiazem, diuretics and old-type antihypertensives (hydralazine, budralazine, and centrally acting drugs such as clonidine, methyldopa and guanabenz) were administered to 71.3%, 30.4%, 26.2%, 14.0%, 8.6%, and 6.4% of the 642 elderly patients surveyed for three years, at the time of registration, respectively.

These results were similar or even better than those of megatrials of antihypertensive treatments for elderly patients in Europe and United States. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, multiple logistic analysis revealed that a past history of ischemic heart disease, use of the old-type antihypertensive drugs, male gender, and diastolic high blood pressure were independent risk factors for the morbidity of cerebro-cardiovascular diseases taking the group of non-cerebro-cardiovascular disease as the reference group. We also identified 22 cases of newly occurred malignancies including 7 fatal cases. However, none of the antihypertensives was significantly related to the occurrence of malignancies.

The effects of anti-hypertensive drug treatment with bendrofluazide and propranolol on pulse pressure were assessed using 1-year follow-up data. Event rates in the placebo-treated group and responses to anti-hypertensive treatment were measured in quartiles of age-adjusted entry pulse pressure. A 'four-corners' analysis was performed, with subjects divided into the upper and lower halves of the distributions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at entry.; Pulse pressure was a stronger predictor of coronary events than systolic, diastolic or mean blood pressure in males by logistic regression. Pulse pressure was similar to systolic pressure as a coronary event predictor on Cox regression. Stroke was predicted most strongly by mean blood pressure. Fatal and non-fatal coronary event rates increased progressively in ascending quartiles of age-adjusted pulse pressure, but there was also a strong correlation with systolic blood pressure. The values of partial logistic regression coefficients in models containing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure also supported a role for pulse pressure in predicting coronary events and for mean blood pressure in predicting stroke. Coronary risk, but not stroke, was inversely related to diastolic blood pressure in the four-corners analysis. In a Cox model, regressions of coronary event probability on systolic blood pressure at entry were significantly and inversely related to diastolic blood pressure categorized in quartiles. Bendrofluazide but not propranolol decreased pulse pressure significantly and was associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events overall, but no definite relationship between the effect of drugs on pulse pressure and specific responses to treatment was seen.; Pulse pressure is a strong risk factor for coronary events in untreated hypertensive male subjects in the MRC Mild Hypertension Trial, whereas stroke is best predicted by mean blood pressure. Bendrofluazide and propranolol have different effects on pulse pressure which may be related to their relative efficacy in the treatment of hypertension, but this possibility requires further study in more suitable populations.",5,E

Rest forced expiratory volume (FEV(1)), vital capacity, total lung capacity, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, its alveolar-capillary membrane component, pulmonary venous and transmitral flows (for monitoring changes in LV end-diastolic pressure), LV diastolic and systolic dimensions, stroke volume, ejection fraction, and fiber shortening velocity were measured at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. VO(2p), peak ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT(p)), ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO(2)), and VO(2) at anaerobic threshold (VO(2at)) were also determined.; FEV(1), vital capacity, total lung capacity, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, and the alveolar-capillary membrane component were impaired in chronic heart failure compared with 14 volunteers and did not vary with treatment. Carvedilol reduced end-diastolic pressure, end-diastolic diameter, and end-systolic diameter and increased ejection fraction, stroke volume, and fiber shortening velocity without affecting VO(2p), VO(2at), VD/VT(p), or VE/VCO(2) at 3 and 6 months. Placebo did not produce significant changes.; In chronic heart failure carvedilol ameliorates LV function at rest and does not significantly affect ventilation and pulmonary gas transfer or functional capacity. These results suggest that improvement in cardiac hemodynamics with carvedilol does not reverse pulmonary dysfunction. Persistent lung impairment might have some role in the failure of carvedilol to improve exercise performance.",E,E

Computerized records of hospital discharges and cardiac catheterizations were used to identify unstable angina diagnoses among veterans between 1990 and 1995. Discharge medications issued within 90 days after discharge were ascertained from computerized outpatient pharmacy records. Of the 1,100 veterans discharged with unstable angina, 885 (80%) filled a prescription through the VAPSHCS within 90 days after discharge. Neither use of aspirin nor use of beta blockers increased between 1990 and 1995: overall use averaged 76% for aspirin (78% of those without potential contraindications) and 32% for beta blockers (36% of those without potential contraindications). Use of non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists--primarily diltiazem--decreased from 57% to 40% (p <0.01), whereas use of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists increased from 12% to 26% (p <0.01). Thus, pharmacy records indicated that aspirin use was high although it was lower than expected, possibly due to ready availability outside the VAPSHCS pharmacy. The low frequency of beta-blocker use and the increasing reliance on dihydropyridine calcium antagonists through 1995 to treat unstable angina may be an opportunity to improve veteran care according to Agency for Health Care Policy Research recommendations.",E,E

Incorporating interim analyses and the possibility of early stopping into the trial increases its complexity, and although normal approximations have been developed for computing the significance level of the test when the log-rank or other rank statistics are used, there are no reliable analytic approximations for evaluating the power of the test. This article presents methods, based on Monte Carlo simulations and recent advances in group sequential testing with time-to-event responses, to choose appropriate test statistics, compute power and sample size at specified alternatives, check the adequacy of commonly used normal approximations of the type I error probability, and assess the performance of different interim analysis strategies.

A common A to C substitution at position -204 of the promoter of CYP7 gene has been associated with variations in plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations but the effect of this polymorphism is unknown in the general population. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate the association of this polymorphism to lipoprotein levels in a population-based sample of 1139 male and 1191 female Framingham Offspring participants. In men, the C variant was associated with higher plasma concentrations of LDL-cholesterol and this association remained significant after adjustment for familial relationship, age, BMI, smoking, alcohol intake, the use of beta-blockers, and apoE genotype. The C variant was also associated with an increased TC/HDL ratio in men. Variance components analysis indicated that allelic variability at nucleotide -204 of the CYP7 gene and polymorphism of the apoE gene accounted for 1 and 5% of the variation of plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations, respectively. In women, however, there was no relationship between LDL-cholesterol and the A-204C polymorphism but subjects homozygous for the CC genotype had significantly lower triglyceride levels than heterozygotes. Moreover, no significant relationship was found between the A-204C variants and lipoprotein particle diameter or the prevalence of coronary heart disease in both genders. Thus, our results show that the A-204C polymorphism in the CYP7 gene is associated with statistically significant variations in LDL-C and triglyceride concentrations in men and women, respectively, but the cumulative effects of these variations on atherosclerotic risk remain uncertain.",E,E

Patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 110 mm Hg at the end of a 4-week run-in period) were randomly allocated to a double-blind, 12-week treatment with either a combination tablet of felodipine and metoprolol (Logimax), 5/50 mg daily (n = 321), enalapril, 10 mg daily (n = 321), or placebo (n = 304), with the possibility of doubling the dose after 4 or 8 weeks of treatment if needed (diastolic blood pressure remaining >90 mm Hg). The combined felodipine-metoprolol treatment controlled blood pressure (diastolic < or =90 mm Hg 24 h after dose) in 72% of patients after 12 weeks, as compared with 49% for enalapril and 30% for placebo. A dose adjustment was required in 38% of patients receiving the combination, in 63% of patients allocated to placebo, and 61% of enalapril-treated patients. The overall incidence of adverse events was 54.5% during felodipine-metoprolol treatment; the corresponding values for enalapril and placebo were 51.7% and 47.4%, respectively. Withdrawal of treatment due to adverse events occurred in 18 patients treated with the combination, in 10 patients on enalapril, and 12 patients on placebo. No significant change in patients' well-being was observed in either of the three study groups. These results show that a fixed combination tablet of felodipine and metoprolol allows to normalize blood pressure in a substantially larger fraction of patients than enalapril given alone. This improved efficacy is obtained without impairing the tolerability. The fixed-dose combination of felodipine and metoprolol, therefore, may become a valuable option to initiate antihypertensive treatment.",E,E

The SHEP was a randomized multicenter double-blind outpatient clinical trial of the impact of treating ISH in men and women aged 60 years and older.; Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with DBP and systolic blood pressure (SBP) as time-dependent covariables.; After adjustment for the baseline risk factors of race (black vs other), sex, use of antihypertensive medication before the study, a composite variable (diabetes, previous heart attack, or stroke), age, and smoking history (ever vs never) and adjustment for the SBP as a time-dependent variable, we found, for the active treatment group only, that a decrease of 5 mm Hg in DBP increased the risk for stroke (relative risk, [RR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.22), for CHD (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.16), and for CVD (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16).; Some patients with ISH may be treated to a level that uncovers subclinical disease, and some may be overtreated. Further studies need to determine whether excessively low DBP can be prevented by more careful titration of antihypertensive therapy while maintaining SBP control. It is reassuring that patients receiving treatment for ISH never perform worse than patients receiving placebo in terms of CVD events.",E,E

Blood pressure reduction was satisfactorily achieved with both drugs, although the decrease in the atenolol group was larger than that in the doxazosin group. A reduction in the levels of vWF occurred in both groups, being more pronounced in the alpha-blocker group compared with the decrease on beta blockers, p = 0.004 and p = 0.056, respectively. In the alpha-blocker group, there was a significant correlation (r = 0.50, p = 0.022) between the reduction in diastolic blood pressure and the decline in vWF. A highly significant decrease in plasma ET-1 was obtained during beta blockade (p = 0.007), whereas no significant change occurred within the alpha-blocker group. There was, however, no correlation between the decrease in blood pressure and the reduction in ET-1. The different favorable effects of alpha and beta blockers on endothelial function expressed as vWF and ET-1, could indicate that the effects are probably related not only to the blood pressure per se, but also to the different pharmacologic mechanisms of the drugs.",E,E

Therefore, the effect of beta-blocking with metoprolol for prevention of supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA) was investigated in a prospective and randomized trial. 200 patients after CABG were randomized in a drug and control group (average age 63.2 years, 154 male, 46 female). Patients of the drug group (n=100) were treated with metoprolol (1mg/kg/BW) beginning on day one after operation, whereas patients of the control group (n=100) received therapy only in case of occurrence of atrial fibrillation.

Drug-induced nighttime hypotension in patients with chronic hypertension has been associated with the precipitation of cardiac failure and a fall in cerebral flow. The authors examined the effects of a single dose and of a 4-week treatment with different classes of antihypertensive drugs on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in 10 patients with mild hypertension. Data were assessed by polynomial analysis (Harvard Graphics 3). A single oral dose of enalapril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, carvedilol 25 mg, and celiprolol 200 mg produced a mean reduction of 24-hour ABP compared to placebo of, respectively, 24/11, 11/5, 13/6, and 12/5 mm Hg (p values between <0.02 and <0.001). With enalapril, amlodipine, and carvedilol, between-subject variability contributed significantly to the overall variability in the measurements (p values between 0.05 and 0.01 versus zero), whereas with celiprolol this was not so. Although the beta blockers reduced daytime blood pressures similarly to the ACE inhibitor or the calcium channel blocker, they did not reduce nighttime blood pressures. These results were confirmed by an 8-week crossover trial comparing enalapril 10 mg daily with celiprolol 200 mg daily in the same group of patients. The authors conclude (1) that beta blockers produce a more stable reduction of blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension less affected by pressor effects through the sympathetic nervous system; (2) that beta blockers, unlike ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, do not give rise to nighttime hypotension in this category of patients; and (3) that the selective beta blocker celiprolol may even perform better in these respects than the nonselective beta blocker carvedilol.",E,E

There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to enalapril with a median follow-up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow-up of 967 days. Decreased renal function was defined as a rise in serum creatinine >/=0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) from baseline.

By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age, diuretic therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing decreased renal function in both groups, but significantly more so in the enalapril group (enalapril: risk ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.52 with enalapril; placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25).

This study investigated the anatomic characteristics and electrophysiological properties of pulmonary veins (PVs), as well as the possible mechanisms and response to drugs of ectopic foci, and assessed the effects of radiofrequency (RF) ablation on AF initiated by ectopic beats originating from PVs.; Seventy-nine patients with frequent episodes of paroxysmal AF and 10 control patients were included. Distal PVs showed the shortest effective refractory periods (ERPs), and right superior PVs showed a higher incidence of intra-PV conduction block than left superior PVs. Superior and left PVs had longer myocardial sleeves than inferior and right PVs, respectively. These electrophysiological characteristics were similar between AF and control patients. Propranolol, verapamil, and procainamide suppressed ectopic beats that originated from the PVs. Of 116 ectopic foci that initiated AF, 103 (88.8%) originated from PVs. A mean of 7+/-3 RF applications completely eliminated 110 ectopic foci (94.8%). During the 6+/-2-month follow-up period, 68 patients (86. 1%) were free of AF without any antiarrhythmic drugs. Follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram showed 42.4% of ablated PVs had focal stenosis. One patient had mild exertional dyspnea after ablation, but it resolved 3 months later; 1 patient had onset of mild exertional dyspnea 5 months after ablation.; Electrophysiological characteristics of PVs are different from those in the atria. Ectopic beats from PVs can initiate AF, and beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, calcium channel blockers, and sodium channel blockers can suppress these ectopic beats. Careful mapping and elimination of these ectopic foci can cure paroxysmal AF.",E,E

Patients were enrolled in a specific staged-care approach protocol, which included coronary arteriography (CAR) and ventriculography (VC), in order to exclude the need of cardiac surgery, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), with and without left ventricular aneurysmectomy (LVA). The protocol included inducibility of VT/VF, which was verified by programmed electrical stimulation (PES) in control conditions and after antiarrhythmic therapy (ADT), to assess persistent inducibility and mainly to verify the hemodynamic sequelae of VT. VT that showed poor hemodynamic tolerance was treated with ICD, while well-tolerated VT was treated by ADT or ablation when indicated. Furthermore, PES was obtained after surgical procedures. As a first step, the patients were assigned to receive amiodarone (AMIO) (200-400 mg/daily) in the presence of EF% < 30% or contraindication to sotalol, (Group A), or sotalol (SOT) (80-140 mg/daily) in the presence of EF > or = 31%. (Group C). Conversely, in case of recurrences, patients were assigned to receive AMIO (200-300 mg/daily) plus metoprolol (MET) (20-100 mg/daily), (Group B) or, in case of intolerance to beta-blockers, to AMIO plus mexiletine (MEX) (200 mg/daily) (Group D). The four groups were similar for the type of VA, with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (RVT) being the most frequent one. The most frequent underlying cardiac disease of VA in this study was post-AMI CAD, with a rate of over 60% in all four groups. Single- and two-vessel lesions were found at CAR in various patients in all four groups, in 5/13 (38%) in Group A, in 8/14 (57%) in Group B, in 5/7 (71%) in Group C, and in 3/5 (60%) in Group D. Cardiac surgery was performed in a similar and limited number of patients in all four groups, in 4/13 (30%) in Group A, in 4/14 (35%) in Group B, in 2/7 (28%) in Group C, and in 2/5 (40%) in Group D. In 8/39 (20.5%) of the patients who underwent CABG, there was no operative or late mortality; 4/39 (10.2%) received CABG and LVA, and two died. For the amiodarone plus metoprolol and sotalol patients only, PES showed a lower residual inducibility, in comparison to the amiodarone and amiodarone + mexiletine groups. In the entire group, 7 out of 26 (27%) were still inducibile at PES while in 19/26 (64%) of the patients, an apparently effective treatment could be found, documenting the relative usefulness of PES. Recurrence rate was the highest in the amiodarone + mexiletine group and in patients with previous CA. Our data show the potential utility and limitations of ADT, even using the most effective antiarrhythmic drugs and association of drugs, mainly because of the high recurrence rate of VT observed in the present study, even in non-inducible patients [14/39 (36%)]. In conclusion, in a prospective and staged-care approach protocol of management of VT/VF patients, only a few patients with VT/VF benefited from cardiac surgery. PES could still play a role in the evaluation of the most effective ADT. Amiodarone + metoprolol seems to be the most effective ADT in these patients. Nevertheless, a high recurrence rate was observed in this patient population, even with an aggressive protocol, in the short follow-up period of 12 +/- 8 months, confirming recent data on the superiority of ICD to ADT, in patients with frequent recurrences or hemodynamically poorly-tolerated VT. In these patients, ICD therapy should definitively be preferred to ADT.",1,E

In the CBF-targeted protocol, cerebral perfusion pressure was kept at >70 mm Hg and PaCO2 was kept at approximately 35 torr (4.67 kPa). In the ICP-targeted protocol, cerebral perfusion pressure was kept at >50 mm Hg and hyperventilation to a PaCO2 of 25-30 torr (3.33-4.00 kPa) was used to treat intracranial hypertension.; The CBF-targeted protocol reduced the frequency of jugular desaturation from 50.6% to 30% (p = .006). Even when the frequency of jugular desaturation was adjusted for all confounding factors that were significant, the risk of cerebral ischemia was 2.4-fold greater with the ICP-targeted protocol. Despite the reduction in secondary ischemic insults, there was no difference in neurologic outcome. Failure to alter long-term neurologic outcome was probably attributable to two major factors. A low jugular venous oxygen saturation was treated in both groups, minimizing the injury that occurred in the ICP-targeted group. The beneficial effects of the CBF-targeted protocol may have been offset by a five-fold increase in the frequency of adult respiratory distress syndrome.; Secondary ischemic insults caused by systemic factors after severe head injury can be prevented with a targeted management protocol. However, potential adverse effects of this management strategy may offset these beneficial effects.",E,E

Metoprolol, a selective beta-blocker, is widely used, but recent trials suggest carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker with alpha-1-receptor antagonist activity and antioxidant activities, is also effective. It is uncertain, however, if these additional properties of carvedilol provide further clinical benefit compared with metoprolol.; In this randomized double-blind control trial, 51 patients with chronic heart failure and mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 26% +/- 1.8% were randomly assigned treatment with metoprolol 50 mg twice daily or carvedilol 25 mg twice daily in addition to standard therapy after a four-week dose titration period for a total of 12 weeks. Response was assessed by a quality of life questionnaire, New York Heart Association class, exercise capacity (6-min walk test), radionucleotide ventriculography for LV ejection fraction, two-dimensional echocardiography measurement of LV dimensions and diastolic filling and 24-h electrocardiograph monitoring to assess heart rate variability.; Both carvedilol and metoprolol produced highly significant improvement in symptoms (p < 0.001), exercise capacity (p < 0.05) and LV ejection fraction (p < 0.001), and there were no significant differences between the two drugs. Carvedilol had a significantly greater effect on sitting and standing blood pressure, LV end-diastolic dimension and normalized the mitral E wave deceleration time.; Both metoprolol and carvedilol were equally effective in improving symptoms, quality of life, exercise capacity and LV ejection fraction, although carvedilol lowers blood pressure more than metoprolol.",I,I

Tedisamil and atenolol produced a decrease in heart rate both at rest (day 1: -13.6 vs -15.4 bpm; p > 0.05; day 6: -14.8 vs -22.2 bpm; resp.; p > 0.05) and exercise (day 1: -9.1 vs -18.3 bpm; p = 0. 001; day 6: -12.0 vs -24.8 bpm, resp.; p = 0.001), while anginal threshold increased. Cardiac output decreased with tedisamil and atenolol at rest (day 1: -1.01 vs -1.19 l/min; p > 0.05; day 6: -0. 86 vs -1.10 l/min, resp.; p > 0.05) and exercise (day 1: -0.82 vs -1. 28 l/min; p > 0.05; day 6: -0.65 vs -2.68 l/min, resp.; p = 0.03), while stroke volume remained unchanged. Right atrial pressure changed during exercise only: It decreased with tedisamil (-1.7 mm Hg) and increased with atenolol (+3.7 mm Hg). Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressures decreased at rest (-0.5 mm Hg) and exercise (-6.9 mm Hg) in the tedisamil group, but tended to increase with atenolol on day 6 (rest: +1.7; exercise: +3.7 mm Hg) (p = 0.03). Arterial pressure decreased under atenolol treatment only. Exercise-induced plasma norepinephrine levels were reduced by tedisamil (-93 pg/ml) but elevated by atenolol (+172 pg/ml) (p = 0. 001). As compared to atenolol, tedisamil produced a significant prolongation of QT (c) interval (+31 vs -8 ms) (p = 0.002) at initial values of 0.408 +/- 0.018 s with PQ and QRS remaining unaltered.; In the present study, tedisamil (100 mg b.i.d. ) generated favorable hemodynamic, neurohumoral and anti-ischemic effects in patients with stable angina pectoris.

Since the majority of the patients did not fulfill the criteria of the International Headache Society (IHS) for basilar migraine, the diagnosis was substantiated by disease course, medical efficacy in treating (ergotamines) and preventing (metoprolol, flunarizine) attacks, ocular motor abnormalities in the symptom-free interval, and careful exclusion of the most relevant differential diagnoses, such as transient ischemic attacks, Meni猫re's disease, and vestibular paroxysmia. The following clinical features were elaborated. The initial manifestation could occur at any time throughout life, with a peak in the fourth decade in men and a ""plateau"" between the third and fifth decades in women. The duration of rotational (78%) and/or to-and-fro vertigo (38%) could last from a few seconds to several hours or, less frequently, even days; duration of a few minutes or of several hours was most frequent. Monosymptomatic audiovestibular attacks (78%) occurred as vertigo associated with auditory symptoms in only 16%. Vertigo was not associated with headache in 32% of the patients. In the symptom-free interval 66% of the patients showed mild central ocular motor signs such as vertical (48%) and/or horizontal (22%) saccadic pursuit, gaze-evoked nystagmus (27%), moderate positional nystagmus (11%), and spontaneous nystagmus (11%). Combinations with other forms of migraine were found in 52%. Thus, migraine is a relevant differential diagnosis for episodic vertigo. According to the criteria of the IHS, only 7.8% of these patients would be diagnosed as having basilar migraine. However, to ensure that at least those presenting with monosymptomatic episodic vertigo (78% in our study) receive effective treatment, we propose the use of the more appropriate term ""vestibular migraine.""",E,E

Ambulatory electrocardiograms were analyzed for ventricular premature complexes and ST-segment depression. During a median follow-up of 40 months, 29 patients died of cardiovascular (CV) causes, 27 had a nonfatal myocardial infarction, and 89 underwent revascularization. Patients with CV death had more episodes (median 5 vs. 1; p<0.01) and longer median duration (24 vs. 3 minutes; p<0.01) of ST-segment depression than patients without events. For those who had undergone revascularization, the duration was also longer (12 vs. 3 minutes; p<0.05). In a multivariate Cox model including sex, history of previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, and diabetes, the duration of ST-segment depression independently predicted CV death. When exercise testing was included, ambulatory ischemia carried additional prognostic information only among patients with ST-segment depression > or =2 mm during exercise. When the treatment given and treatment effects on ambulatory ischemia were added to the Cox model, no significant impact on prognosis was found. Ventricular premature complexes carried no prognostic information. Thus, in patients with stable angina pectoris, ischemia during ambulatory monitoring showed independent prognostic importance regarding CV death. Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and exercise testing provide complementary information, but only among patients with marked ischemia during exercise. Treatment reduced ambulatory ischemia, but the short-term treatment effects did not significantly influence prognosis.",E,E

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improve autonomic function in patients with AMI, but the circadian pattern of this effect has not been studied. Heart rate variability-normalized frequency domain indexes were assessed 5 days (baseline) after the onset of uncomplicated AMI and 30 days after therapy with quinapril (n = 30), metoprolol (n = 30), or placebo (n = 30) with a solid-state digital Holter monitor. Normal subjects (n = 30) were used as controls. Quinapril increased parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic modulation, and improved sympathovagal interactions manifested by an increase in normalized high-frequency power (HFP), and a decrease in normalized low-frequency power (LFP), and their ratio (LFP/HFP) during the entire 24-hour period (p<0.001), with maximal effect on the ratio (p<0.0001) between 02.00 to 04.00 A.M., 08.00 to 11.00 A.M., and 19.00 to 22.00 P.M.

Verapamil and metoprolol had only minor effects on the inflammatory variables. In multivariate Cox regression analyses (adjusted for previous MI, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and smoking), fibrinogen and WBC were independent predictors of CV death or non-fatal MI, as well as the risk of revascularization. Orosomucoid did not carry any independent information. Platelet counts and urinary beta-thromboglobulin were not significantly related to CV prognosis. The treatment given did not significantly influence the prognostic impact of either fibrinogen or WBC. Fibrinogen and WBC were independent predictors of CV death or non-fatal MI as well as disease progression leading to revascularization in patients with stable angina pectoris. As fibrinogen is also an acute-phase reactant, the present findings indicate that inflammatory activity is involved in disease progression in stable angina pectoris.",E,E

High-risk patients were identified by the presence of both clinical risk factors and positive results on dobutamine echocardiography. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive standard perioperative care or standard care plus perioperative beta-blockade with bisoprolol.; A total of 1351 patients were screened, and 846 were found to have one or more cardiac risk factors. Of these 846 patients, 173 had positive results on dobutamine echocardiography. Fifty-nine patients were randomly assigned to receive bisoprolol, and 53 to receive standard care. Fifty-three patients were excluded from randomization because they were already taking a beta-blocker, and eight were excluded because they had extensive wall-motion abnormalities either at rest or during stress testing. Two patients in the bisoprolol group died of cardiac causes (3.4 percent), as compared with nine patients in the standard-care group (17 percent, P=0.02). Nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in nine patients given standard care only (17 percent) and in none of those given standard care plus bisoprolol (P<0.001). Thus, the primary study end point of death from cardiac causes or nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in 2 patients in the bisoprolol group (3.4 percent) and 18 patients in the standard-care group (34 percent, P<0.001).; Bisoprolol reduces the perioperative incidence of death from cardiac causes and nonfatal myocardial infarction in high-risk patients who are undergoing major vascular surgery.",E,E

We studied the prevalence and severity of hypotension after the induction of general anesthesia in 12 patients treated with ARA until the morning of surgery. The hemodynamic response to induction was compared with that of patients treated with beta-adrenergic blockers (BB) and/or calcium channel blockers (CB) (BB/CB group, n = 45) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (ACEI group, n = 27). A standardized anesthesia induction protocol was followed for all patients. Hypotension occurred significantly (p < or = 0.05) more often in ARA-treated patients (12 of 12) compared with BB/CB-treated patients (27 of 45) or with ACEI-treated patients (18 of 27). There was a significantly (P < or = 0.001) increased ephedrine requirement in the ARA group (21+/-3 mg) compared with the BB/CB group (10+/-6 mg) or the ACEI group (7+/-4 mg). Hypotension refractory to repeated ephedrine or phenylephrine administration occurred significantly (P < or = 0.05) more in the ARA group (4 of 12) compared with the BB/CB group (0 of 45) or the ACEI group (1 of 27), but it was treated successfully by using a vasopressin system agonist. Treatment with angiotensin II antagonism until the day of surgery is associated with severe hypotension after the induction of anesthesia, which, in some cases, can only be treated with an agonist of the vasopressin system.; Hypotensive episodes occur more frequently after anesthetic induction in patients receiving Angiotensin II receptor subtype-1 antagonists under anesthesia than with other hypotensive drugs. They are less responsive to the vasopressors ephedrine and phenylephrine. The use of a vasopressin system agonist was effective in restoring blood pressure when hypotension was refractory to conventional therapy.",E,E

Electrophysiologic study by testing noninducibility of ventricular arrhythmia represents the classic method for evaluating the effectiveness of drug therapy. Several clinical studies have shown thaat sotalol suppresses VT induction and prevents arrhythmias recurrences at long term follow-up in 23% to 67% of patients. The efficacy of sotalol EP guided therapy in preventing VT/VF is not necessarily related to prevention of sudden death. In the ESVEM study the superiority of d,l-sotalol to other antiarrhythmic drugs was confirmed. The response to programmed ventricular stimulation was found to be strongly predictive for arrhythmia free state while the failure of sotalol therapy to suppress VT at the EP study was associated with an high recurrence rate (40%). However, EP study failes to predict freedom from sudden death. The beta-blocking activity of racemic sotalol may account for some of the observed survival benefit.Beta-blockers therapy reduces mortality in patients after myocardial infarction primarily by a reduction of sudden death. A reduction of death, worsening heart failure and life threatening ventricular arrhythmias was shown in a recent study on carvedilol. In the prospective study of Steinbeck the EP guided-therapy did not improve the overall outcome when compared to metoprolol. Suppression of inducible arrhythmias by antiarrhythmic drugs was associated with a better outcome. The effectiveness of defibrillator therapy in reducing overall mortality, has been uncertain since great clinical trials have been concluded. MADIT, AVID and CASH trials confirmed the superiority of ICD therapy over antiarrhythmic drugs therapy: ICD should be considered the first choice therapy in post-cardiac arrest patients. The ongoing BEST Trial will give us further responses about the interaction between EP study and metoprolol effect compared to ICD in patients post myocardial infarction also focusing on tolerability and compliance of the beta-blocking therapy in patients with low ejection fraction. In this study will be useful to optimize therapy in patients at high risk of sudden death.",I,8

The trials currently underway (including SCD-HEFT, MADIT II, and the CABG-PATCH substudy) are analyzing patients with either coronary or idiopathic cardiomyopathy who have an EF of 35% or under. Patients are randomized to either ICD therapy or no antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Maximal congestive heart failure therapy with ACE inhibitors and beta blockers is used in both arms of each trial. At the conclusion of these trials we should have a better understanding of which group of presumably high risk patients, if any, will benefit from the ICD.

However, less evidence is available concerning the role(s) psychological factors might play in the process of disease recovery.; Eighty patients with known coronary disease and exercise-induced ischemia underwent treadmill exercise testing and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and completed a battery of standardized psychological tests assessing hostility, depression, and daily stress on four occasions during a 12-week pharmacological treatment study. After withdrawal of antiischemic drugs at baseline, patients returned for subsequent tests at 3-week intervals. During the second and third intervals, patients were prescribed one of two antiischemic medications, atenolol or amlodipine, or given a placebo. All patients were then placed on a combination treatment protocol for the 3 weeks before the final testing date.; The combination treatment produced highly significant benefits across all measured cardiac variables (20.3% improvement in exercise performance, 13% reduction in reported angina, 64.0% reduction in the frequency of ischemic episodes; for all, p < .01). However, results showed that high baseline levels of daily stress were associated with reliably smaller treatment effects on measures of ischemia frequency and treadmill exercise time and with a significantly greater likelihood of reporting angina after treatment (r = -0.24, -0.25, and -0.33, respectively; p <.05). In addition, high baseline hostility predicted significantly smaller diastolic blood pressure improvements (r = -0.29, p < .05).; These results indicate that psychological risk factors may have globally negative effects on the course of treatment and suggest particular factors that may warrant attention in trials targeting cardiac symptom reduction.",E,E

The chronotropic index was calculated while peak V(O2) and V(E)/V(CO2) were directly measured. Chronotropic index and peak V(O2) were considered abnormal if in the lowest 25th percentiles of the patient cohort, whereas V(E)/V(CO2) was considered abnormal if in the highest 25th percentile. For comparative purposes, a group of 17 healthy controls underwent metabolic testing as well. Compared with controls, heart failure patients had markedly abnormal ventilatory and chronotropic responses to exercise. In the heart failure cohort, there were 71 deaths. In univariate analyses, predictors of death included high V(E)/V(CO2) low chronotropic index, low V(O2), low resting systolic blood pressure, and older age. Nonparametric Kaplan-Meier plots demonstrated that by dividing the population according to peak V(E)/V(CO2) and peak V(O2), it is possible to identify low, intermediate, and very high risk groups. In multivariate analyses, the only independent predictors of death were high V(E)/V(CO2) (adjusted relative risk [RR] 3.20, 95% CI 1.95 to 5.26, P<0.0001) and low chronotropic index (adjusted RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.19, P=0.0009).; The ventilatory and chronotropic responses to exercise are powerful and independent predictors of heart failure mortality.",E,E

Systolic left ventricular dysfunction, although less frequent, has a worse prognosis. Most cases of systolic dysfunction in patients with hypertension is due to acute myocardial infarction, although other mechanisms can be involved. In some studies, non-ischemic hypertensive systolic dysfunction is the etiology of chronic heart failure in up to 10% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Diastolic dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy are also associated with a higher risk of heart failure and systolic dysfunction. Given the poor prognosis of patients with congestive heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy, it is fundamental to try to prevent the development of left ventricular dysfunction by means of a correct control of blood pressure, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and prevention of coronary artery disease. When systolic dysfunction is established, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are the treatment of choice; diuretics and digoxin can be added in patients with overt congestive heart failure. Recent studies suggest that other drugs, such as carvedilol and losartan, can be beneficial, but current evidence is still scarce.",1,E

It is often accompanied by tachycardia. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of esmolol in the treatment of tachycardia and hypertension immediately following cardiopulmonary bypass and to study other haemodynamic effects of esmolol. Thirty patients undergoing elective [corrected] coronary artery bypass grafting were included in this prospective study. Morphine-based anaesthetic technique along-with standard bypass techniques were used in all the patients. The study was performed in the operating room about 30-45 minutes after the termination of cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients having a heart rate of more than 90 bpm and systolic blood pressure of more than 130 mm Hg without any inotropic support were included and randomly assigned to esmolol or control group. Esmolol was administered in a bolus dose of 500 micrograms/kg followed by infusion of upto 100 micrograms/kg/min. The patients in the control group were administered comparable volumes of normal saline. Baseline haemodynamic measurements were obtained just before the administration of esmolol or normal saline and were repeated after 5, 10, 15, 30 and 45 min. The baseline measurement in both the groups showed that patients were maintaining a state of hyperdynamic circulation with high systolic blood pressure (esmolol group 148 +/- 15 mm Hg, control group 140 +/- 8 mm Hg; p = NS), heart rate (esmolol group 128 +/- 17 bpm, control group 127 +/- 17 bpm; p = NS) and cardiac index (esmolol group 3.1 +/- 1 L/min/m2, control group 3.3 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2; p = NS). Esmolol decreased systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), heart rate (p < 0.01) and cardiac index (p < 0.05) at five minutes. These changes persisted throughout the study period. The left ventricular stroke work index decreased at five minutes (p < 0.05) and remained so till 30 minutes. The maximum fall in heart rate (15%) and systolic blood pressure (16%) was observed at 45 minutes. There were no haemodynamic changes in the control group except that cardiac index, stroke volume and left ventricular stroke work index increased at five minutes. We conclude that esmolol lowers the indices of cardiovascular work in patients who demonstrated hyperdynamic circulation. This was achieved by decreasing the heart rate and systolic blood pressure which was accompanied by decrease in cardiac index and left ventricular stroke work index.",E,E

In this double-blind, randomized prospective study, 96 patients (85 men and 11 women, 48+/-10 years) formed two groups: 49 in the bisoprolol group, and 47 in the nitrendipine group. After a washout period of 14 days, either 10 mg of bisoprolol or 20 mg of nitrendipine was given daily over a treatment period of 12 weeks. During the treatment period, the stability of the physical training was monitored weekly by using a questionnaire. The results of two maximal triangular exercise tolerance tests (ETTs) on an ergometric bicycle performed at D0 under placebo and at D84 under active treatment were compared. No statistical difference was observed between both groups, concerning age, gender, morphologic characteristics, resting cardiovascular parameters, or physical training.

The patient's own perception of the maximal effort (Borg scale) was not significantly different in either of the groups (placebo vs. treatment). Overall, in a population of hypertensive patients taking regular exercise, long-term treatment with bisoprolol produced no significant changes in the duration of peak effort, maximal workload, or the effort perceived by the patients themselves. The effects of regular exercise were comparable in both groups (bisoprolol or nitrendipine). Because previous studies have shown that dihydropyridines do not modify exercise performance in hypertensive patients, it may be concluded that the antihypertensive therapy with bisoprolol is well tolerated in a population of active hypertensive patients during dynamic exercise.",E,E

Serum samples were collected at predetermined time intervals and analyzed for unchanged sumatriptan by high-performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by using model-independent methods. Naproxen had no statistically significant (p > 0.05) effect on any pharmacokinetic parameters of sumatriptan both at 1000 and 2200 hours treatment.

Such criteria would help to identify patients at risk for cardiovascular complications. This retrospective controlled clinical study compared hourly cardiovascular monitoring data from 36 successive, artificially ventilated GBS patients with that from 11 artificially ventilated control patients with myasthenia. Tolerance limits for daily means, extremes, and variations in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were estimated from the most abnormal subgroups of the treatment days of our control patients. These exceeded previously suggested arbitrary cutoff values for dysautonomia. The range in systolic BP was increased in 27 GBS patients, despite an upper limit of normal (85 mmHg) that was double the value suggested in previous work. All 16 patients with mean systolic BP above 165 mmHg also had persistent tachycardia (mean HR > 125 bpm), or were treated with beta-blockers. This pattern of sympathetic hyperactivity was combined with probable vagal hyperactivity (bradycardia < 48 bpm) in 6 patients. Hypotension (minimal systolic BP < 85 mmHg) and unprovoked bradycardia indicated sympathetic hypoactivity in 3 patients. Except in one patient who suffered from asystole on his first day on the ICU, all episodes of bradycardia were preceded by increased daily systolic BP variation (> 85 mmHg), which thus proved to be a sensitive and prognostically valuable indicator of dysautonomia in GBS.",E,E

Hemodynamic measurements were obtained at baseline and after three months of therapy--both before and after drug readministration.; Long term metoprolol therapy produced significant functional, exercise and hemodynamic benefits with no difference in response between either metoprolol preparation in the 27 patients (MT [14], MS [13]). When full dose metoprolol was readministered during chronic therapy, there were parallel adverse hemodynamic effects in both drug groups. Cardiac index decreased by 0.6 liters/min/m2 (p < 0.0001) with MT and by 0.5 liters/min/m2 (p < 0.0001) with MS. Systematic vascular resistance increased by 253 dyne-sec-cm(-5) (p < 0.001) with MT and by 267 dyne-sec-cm(-5) (p < 0.0005) with MS. Stroke volume index decreased by 7.0 ml/m2 (p < 0.0005) with MT and by 6.5 ml/m2 (p < 0.0001) with MS, while SWI decreased by 6.2 g-m/m2 (p < 0.0005) with MT and by 6.0 g-m/m2 (p < 0.001) with MS.; Metoprolol tartrate and MS produce similar hemodynamic and clinical effects acutely and chronically despite the fourfold greater starting dose of MS used in this study. A more rapid initiation with readily available starting doses of MS may offer distinct advantages compared with MT in treating chronic heart failure patients with beta-adrenergic blocking agents.",E,E

One hundred thirty-six essential hypertensive patients who were <50 years old and had never previously received treatment with antihypertensive drugs were included in the study. During a 3-year period, patients received nonpharmacological treatment consisting of moderate salt restriction and a low-calorie diet they were obese, with or without a regimen of antihypertensive drugs based on beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors. Hydrochlorothiazide was added when necessary to maintain the blood pressure goal of <135/85 mm Hg. At the beginning of the study and at yearly intervals, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP, respectively), 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE), renal function, and biochemical profile measurements were made. The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene was determined through the use of polymerase chain reaction. The variables used in the statistical analysis were the measurements at the start of the study and the increase or decrease detected during the follow-up, estimated as individual specific regression line slope values. At baseline, no differences in blood pressure or UAE values were observed among genotypes. Likewise, the genotype or allele frequency was not significantly different between normoalbuminurics and microalbuminurics. After the 3 treatment years, significant reductions in SBP, DBP, and UAE were found (SBP 151.6+/-17.3 reduced to 137.2+/-14.3 mm Hg, P<0.001; DBP 96.6+/-8.9 reduced to 84.5+/-9.8 mm Hg, P<0.001; UAE 36.7+/-71.5 reduced to 28.3+/-78.6 mg/24 h, P<0. 05). The slopes of these parameters over time did not differ significantly among genotypes. The slope of SBP was the main factor related to the slope of logUAE (P<0.003). A significant positive correlation coefficient between the SBP and logUAE slopes was observed for the DD patients (r=0.57, P<0.0001) but was absent in patients carrying the I allele (II r=-0.03, P=NS; I/D r=0.01, P=NS). Follow-up studies should be used to achieve a better understanding of the impact of candidate gene polymorphisms on the development of hypertension-induced organ damage. Assessment of the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene may identify subjects who require a greatly lowered blood pressure to prevent organ damage and to reduce hypertension-associated complications and death.",E,E

The purpose of this study was to examine the relations between baseline variables, the interactions between treatment, bisoprolol, or placebo, and the occurrence of critical events during the CIBIS trial, a mortality and morbidity trial of beta-blockade in patients with heart failure.; A Cox model for censored data was used to analyze the relations between baseline variables, total deaths, permanent treatment withdrawals, nonlethal cardiovascular events, and their interactions with bisoprolol or placebo. We examined the influence of treatment on the occurrence of deaths, permanent treatment withdrawals, and nonlethal cardiovascular events by using the technique of event history analysis, which takes into account competitive risks between events. Compared with placebo, bisoprolol reduced mortality rates in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < or =20% (relative risk [RR] 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27 to 0.88; P =.02). In patients whose baseline heart rate was in the upper tertile of distribution, permanent treatment withdrawals were less frequent in patients randomly assigned to bisoprolol than in patients randomly assigned to placebo (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.88; P =.02). Bisoprolol reduced the incidence of nonlethal cardiac events in patients in whom heart failure was present for at least 4 years (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.71; P <.01). Event history analysis revealed that among patients who died under treatment after having at least 1 nonlethal cardiovascular event, 20 patients were treated with placebo but only 7 patients were treated with bisoprolol (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.98; P <.05).; Some patients with heart failure derive more benefit from beta-blocker therapy than others.

We analyzed baseline data from a randomized, double-blind study of estrogen/progestin replacement therapy in 2763 postmenopausal women <80 years old with CHD. Demographics, CHD risk factors, medications, anthropometrics, and lipid levels were compared among women with low, normal, and high HDL-C by NCEP criteria with and without stratification by use of lipid-lowering medications. Independent correlates of high HDL-C were determined by logistic regression analysis. HDL-C > or =60 mg/dL was present in 20% of participants. Women with high HDL-C were older, better educated, had fewer CHD risk factors, lower triglyceride levels and total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, and were more likely to report past estrogen and current calcium antagonist, niacin, and statin use. beta-Blocker, diuretic, and fibrate use was less common. Older age, alcohol consumption, niacin, and calcium antagonist use and prior estrogen use were independently associated with high HDL-C, whereas waist-to-hip ratio, smoking, triglyceride level, and beta-blocker and fibrate use were inversely associated (all P <.05).; High HDL-C, as defined by the NCEP, occurred in 20% of women with CHD in this cohort without a concomitantly higher prevalence of other CHD risk factors.

Similarly, although antihypertensive therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of HF in hypertensive patients, it is not known how this benefit is produced and, currently, there is no clear evidence that any class of antihypertensive agent is more effective than any other in this respect. On theoretical grounds, beta-blockers would be expected to be ideal agents for the prevention of HF in hypertensive patients. In addition to control of blood pressure and regression of LVH, they have clear benefits on morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction (MI), which probably plays a major role in the development of HF in hypertensive patients, and on the prognosis of HF itself. A reduction in long-term mortality after MI has been demonstrated only for non-selective beta-blockers. Carvedilol, a non-selective beta-blocker which also has other ancillary properties including alpha-1-receptor blockade and antioxidant effects and a favourable metabolic profile, may be an appropriate choice for the prevention of HF in hypertensive patients. This is reinforced by the salutary benefits of carvedilol for the reduction in the morbidity and mortality of HF itself.",I,8

It was our hypothesis that adjunctive magnesium sulfate would improve the efficacy of beta-blockers alone in the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation.; We prospectively randomized 167 coronary artery bypass patients (mean age 61+/-10 years, 115 men) to receive propranolol alone (20 mg four times daily) or propranolol and magnesium (18 g over 24 hours). Magnesium was begun intraoperatively, and propranolol was started on admission to the intensive care unit.; Using an intention-to-treat analysis, the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was 19.5% in the propranolol-treated patients and 22.4% in propranolol + magnesium-treated patients (p = 0.65). Because combination therapy resulted in an excess of postoperative hypotension, which required withholding doses of propranolol, an on-treatment analysis was also performed. In this analysis, the incidence of atrial fibrillation was still not significantly different (18.5% in propranolol-treated patients and 10.0% in propranolol + magnesium-treated patients, p = 0.20).; Adjunctive magnesium sulfate, in combination with propranolol, does not decrease the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation.",E,E

On nondialysis days, Cmax and T1/2 were significantly higher in patients than in healthy control subjects. However, Cmax in the 2.5-mg/day patients was almost equal to that in healthy control subjects receiving 5.0 mg/day of bisoprolol. Plasma bisoprolol was dialyzable. During the course of the study, dialysis hypotension and bradycardia occurred in two patients receiving 5.0 mg/day of bisoprolol.

After a 21 day run in period on timolol 0.5% twice daily, patients were randomised either to latanoprost 0.005% once daily or to a fixed combination of timolol-pilocarpine twice daily. Changes in mean diurnal IOP from the baseline to the 6 week visit were determined with an analysis of covariance.; Mean diurnal IOP was statistically significantly decreased from baseline in both groups (p<0.001). Switching to latanoprost treatment reduced mean diurnal IOP by 5.4 (SEM 0.3) mm Hg (ANCOVA -22%) and switching to timolol-pilocarpine treatment reduced mean diurnal IOP by 4.9 (0.4) mm Hg (-20%). Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, decreased twilight vision, and headache were statistically significantly more frequent in the timolol-pilocarpine group.; Latanoprost monotherapy was at least as effective as fixed combination timolol-pilocarpine twice daily treatment in reducing mean diurnal IOP in patients not adequately controlled on topical beta adrenergic antagonists. Latanoprost was better tolerated than timolol-pilocarpine regarding side effects.

We have recently shown that the addition of isosorbide mononitrate to nadolol decreases the rate of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and varices, compared with nadolol alone, after a median follow-up of 30 months. It is not established if the long-term treatment with the combination continues to be beneficial. Therefore, we assessed the long-term effect of this combination on first variceal bleeding, complications, and death. One hundred forty-six cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices included in a previously published multicenter, randomized study comparing nadolol (40-160 mg/d) with the combination nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate (10-20 mg 3 times per day) were followed up for up to 7 years (median follow-up, 55 months). The primary end-point was variceal bleeding of any severity. Twenty-four patients (16 in the nadolol group, and 8 in the combination group) experienced variceal bleeding (log rank test, P =.02). Cumulative risk of bleeding was 29% and 12%, respectively (95% CI for the difference, 1%-23%). Two and 4 patients, respectively, had bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy (log rank test, P =.20). Thirty and 25 patients, respectively, died during follow-up (log rank test, P =.13).

The prognostic usefulness of exercise BP has yet to be translated into clinical practice because of the lack of a suitable technique. The Dundee Step Test is being evaluated in the ASCOT (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcome Trial) study, a 5-year follow-up multicentre, multinational trial comparing the effect of newer (amlodipine and perindopril) and older (bendroflumethiazide and atenolol) antihypertensive agents stratified according to cholesterol levels on cardiac outcome. If the value of the Dundee Step Test is proven, then it may be adopted into routine clinical practice for the assessment of exercise BP. This may result in the improved management of hypertension with a subsequent reduction in morbidity and mortality.

Forty-seven normotensive subjects were similarly evaluated as control subjects.; The FBF during reactive hyperemia in the 296 hypertensive patients was significantly less than that in age-matched normotensive subjects. The increase in FBF after administration of sublingual NTG was similar in both groups. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and forearm vascular resistance were greater in the untreated group than in the four treated groups and did not differ with respect to the antihypertensive agent used.

All 9 comparisons demonstrated good heart rate control with beta-blockers during exercise, although exercise tolerance was compromised in 3 of 9 comparisons. In 7 of 8 trials, digoxin administered alone slowed the resting heart rate more than placebo, but it did not significantly slow the rate during exercise in 4 studies. The trials evaluating other drugs yielded insufficient evidence to support their use, but those drugs may yet be promising.; The calcium-channel blockers verapamil or diltiazem, or select beta-blockers are efficacious for heart rate control at rest and during exercise for patients with atrial fibrillation without a clinically important decrease in exercise tolerance. Digoxin is useful when rate control during exercise is less a concern.",E,E

Sixty adult patients with one or two vessel coronary artery disease, were randomly divided into 2 equal groups. Group A received a 500 micrograms/kg loading dose of esmolol followed by a 100 micrograms/kg/h infusion, for control of heart rate during surgical anastomosis of the coronary vessel. While Group B received 0.15 mg/kg diltiazem as a loading dose followed by a 5 mg/h infusion for heart rate control, during the anastomosis. It was seen that heart rate control was better in Group A, 51.4 (+/- 1.3) beats/min, than in Group B, 69.6 (+/- 3.9) beats/min but the decrease in heart rate was significant in both the groups at peak effect compared to respective predrug values. Group A patients had unchanged systemic resistance and pulmonary artery wedge pressure but mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance were significantly raised. Group B patients had decreased systemic resistance, mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure, and reduced right ventricular stroke work index. We concluded that although esmolol provided dramatically slower heart rates, during surgery, the resulting elevations in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance would require caution if used in patients with underlying right ventricular dysfunction from ischaemia or infarction. Diltiazem by virtue of its effects on systemic vascular resistance, cardiac output, and lowering of mean arterial pressure may be a better choice in hypertensive patients.",E,E

Brinzolamide 1.0%, a new topical ocular carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is effective apparently without significant systemic side effects. This study was performed to establish the long-term safety and efficacy of brinzolamide 1.0% two and three times daily for primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.; An 18-month, multicenter, double-masked, parallel, controlled study was conducted. Patients were randomized to brinzolamide two or three times daily or timolol 0.5% twice daily in a 2:2:1 ratio (n = 150, 153, and 75, respectively). Intraocular pressure was measured at 8:00 AM at eligibility and months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18. Efficacy was based on intraocular pressure reduction from baseline. Safety was also evaluated.; All regimens produced clinically relevant and statistically significant (P<.05) intraocular pressure reductions from baseline. Mean changes in intraocular pressure trough measurements ranged from -2.7 to -3.9 mm Hg with brinzolamide twice-daily dosing and -2.8 to -3.8 mm Hg three times daily dosing compared with -4.7 to -5.6 mm Hg with timolol. The intraocular pressure reductions with brinzolamide two and three times daily were clinically and statistically equivalent. One hundred forty-four patients were discontinued from the study after randomization with the most common reasons being the occurrence of an adverse event (46), inadequate intraocular pressure control (23), patient decision unrelated to study medication (11), lost to follow-up (16), and noncompliance (9). Adverse events were nonserious and resolved without sequelae. There were no clinically relevant changes in safety parameters. Brinzolamide produced less ocular discomfort (burning/stinging) than timolol, and total carbonic anhydrase inhibition levels remained below that known to cause systemic side effects.; Brinzolamide produced significant and equivalent reductions in intraocular pressure when dosed two and three times daily for 18 months. Brinzolamide was safe and well tolerated by patients, with minimal ocular discomfort.",3,E

HbA1c was 8.0 (7.9-9.4)% (median; percentiles 25-75). Chronic neurological and vascular (micro- and macroangiopathy) complications were present in 21-43% of patients and were related to glycaemic control. (Un)treated hypertension was found in 59% of patients. Main treatments were ACE-inhibitors (40%), calcium channel antagonists and diuretics (20%) and/or beta-blockers (18%). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 147 +/- 22 and 86 +/- 12 mm/Hg (mean +/- 1 SD).

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of trimetazidine and atenolol upon symptoms, resting left ventricular filling dynamics and exercise tolerance.; Sixteen patients (3 males, 13 females, mean age 62 +/- 7 years) were randomized to receive trimetazidine for 2 weeks (20 mg 3 times daily) or atenolol (100 mg daily), according to a double-blind, randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled design. At the end of each treatment period patients underwent symptom-limited exercise testing, an echocardiogram and a Doppler assessment of transmitral flow pattern. Daily life anginal symptoms were annotated on a diary throughout the study. Two patients discontinued trimetazidine because of severe palpitations and only 14 patients completed the study.; Atenolol significantly reduced the number of anginal episodes as compared to placebo or trimetazidine (0.44 +/- 0.53, 4.8 +/- 4, 2.9 +/- 4.9, p < 0.01). On atenolol, the exercise test was negative in 8 patients, but none of the patients had a negative test while on trimetazidine. Atenolol increased both time to 1 mm ST segment depression (668 +/- 213 vs 838 +/- 81 s, p < 0.05) and Doppler-derived indices of ventricular filling (E/A ratio 0.87 +/- 0.20 vs 1.21 +/- 0.26, p < 0.05).; These results confirm the beneficial effects of atenolol in improving symptoms, exercise performance and diastolic function in syndrome X patients. Trimetazidine did not exert any significant effect on any of the analyzed variables. Since trimetazidine has been previously shown to improve myocardial ischemia in patients with overt coronary artery disease to a similar extent of beta-blockers, it is likely that other mechanisms are responsible for angina in patients with syndrome X.",E,E

B-mode ultrasound is used to measure the primary and secondary endpoints including the mean maximum intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid bifurcations and the common carotid arteries (CBM(max)), the mean maximum IMT of 12 standard carotid sites (M(max)) and the overall maximum IMT (T(max)). This paper reports the cross-sectional reproducibility of ultrasound measurements at baseline.; To evaluate measurement reliability, each patient is scanned twice at baseline and again at four annual visits, with 80% of the replicate scans performed by the same sonographer and 20% by a different sonographer; 50% of the replicate scans are read by the same reader and the other 50% by different readers.; The overall coefficient of reliability (R) was 0.859 for CBM(max), 0.872 for M(max) and 0.794 for T(max).

Intravenous glucose tolerance tests, euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamps and serum lipid measurements were performed after 8 and 48 weeks of active treatment. After 48 weeks insulin sensitivity was reduced by 23% by atenolol while it remained unchanged during trandolapril treatment (+0.5%, P = 0.0010 for difference between treatments, ANCOVA). The effect on triglycerides (+22% vs -8.5%) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-13% vs +0.7%) also differed significantly between atenolol and trandolapril. Results after 8 weeks were similar. Glucose tolerance was not affected by either drug. Atenolol reduced diastolic blood pressure (DBP) better than trandolapril (-15.3 mm Hg vs -6.6 mm Hg for supine DBP after 48 weeks, P = 0.012). The difference in effect on insulin sensitivity between the drugs corresponded to 25% of the baseline values of insulin sensitivity, and persisted over 48 weeks of treatment.

Therefore, the objectives of this phase I study were to assess the potential effects of the coadministration of lansoprazole on the pharmacokinetics of propranolol and to evaluate the safety of propranolol with concomitant lansoprazole dosing. In a double-blind fashion, 18 healthy male nonsmokers were initially randomized to receive either 60 mg oral lansoprazole, each morning for 7 days, or an identical placebo (period 1). On day 7, all subjects were concomitantly administered oral propranolol, 80 mg. After a minimum of 1 week following the last dose of either lansoprazole or placebo, subjects were crossed over to the opposite treatment for another 7 days (period 2). Subjects were again administered oral propranolol on day 7. During both treatment periods, blood samples for the determination of plasma propranolol and 4-hydroxy-propranolol were obtained just before the dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours postdose. Plasma propranolol and 4-hydroxy-propranolol concentrations were determined by using HPLC with fluorescence detection. The Cmax, tmax, AUC0-infinity, and t1/2 values for propranolol, as well as the AUC0-infinity for 4-hydroxy-propranolol, were calculated and compared between the lansoprazole and placebo regimens. The mean age of the 15 subjects who successfully completed the study was 31 years (range: 24-38 years), and their average weight was 174.8 pounds (range: 145-203 pounds). There were no statistically significant differences between the lansoprazole and placebo regimens for the propranolol Cmax, tmax, AUC0-infinity, and t1/2 values. Also, there were no statistically significant differences between regimens for the 4-OH-propranolol AUC0-infinity. Safety evaluations, which included adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory determinations, ECG, and physical examinations, revealed no unexpected clinically significant findings and did not suggest a drug-drug interaction. In conclusion, lansoprazole does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of propranolol, suggesting that it does not interact with the CYP2D6- or CYP2C19-mediated metabolism of propranolol. Modification of a propranolol dosage regimen in the presence of lansoprazole is not indicated, based on the pharmacokinetic analysis and the lack of a clinically significant alteration in the pharmacodynamic response.",I,E

The aim of the CHRISTMAS (Carvedilol Hibernation Reversible Ischaemia Trial, Marker of Success) study is to examine whether hibernation may be a significant factor determining this response. This paper describes the methodology and the rationale for the choice of the nuclear cardiology and echocardiography imaging techniques used in the study.; The CHRISTMAS study is a double-blind, randomised, parallel group, multinational study of oral carvedilol versus placebo in patients with chronic stable heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction from coronary artery disease. The study aims to randomise 400 patients who are on optimal treatment. Two parallel groups will be randomised to carvedilol or placebo, namely 200 with hibernating myocardium at baseline and 200 matched patients without. The presence of hibernation is defined from a mismatch between regional contractile function and regional viability, measured by echocardiography (severe segmental asynergy) and nitrate prepared resting Tc99m-MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging (segmental activity >60%). The primary treatment-related end-point of the study is the comparison of the mean change, from baseline to the final visit, in radionuclide-determined left ventricular ejection fraction in patients on placebo with those on carvedilol, between the groups designated as hibernating and non-hibernating. Other end-points being examined include the prevalence of hibernation in heart failure, the relationship between the volume of hibernating myocardium and the ejection fraction response, the prevalence of reversible ischemia in heart failure, and the comparison of echo with gated SPECT. To date, 303 patients have been screened and 251 patients randomised in the study. The study aims to report in 2000.; The CHRISTMAS study addresses the issue of whether the presence of hibernation is a predictor of the ejection fraction response to carvedilol in heart failure. It also examines the potential role of medical therapy in hibernation as well as a number of other end-points. The study may potentially lead to an important new role for nuclear cardiology in heart failure, and demonstrates important synergy between cardiac imaging and the pharmaceutical industry.",E,E
10718104,Felodipine/metoprolol: a review of the fixed dose controlled release formulation in the management of essential hypertension.,"Drug Therapy, Combination; Felodipine; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypertension; Kidney; Metoprolol; Quality of Life","Haria, M; Plosker, G L; Markham, A","The main objective of fixed dose combination therapy for hypertension is to improve blood pressure (BP) control with lower, better tolerated dosages of 2 antihypertensives rather than higher dosages of a single agent. Felodipine and metoprolol lower BP via different, but complementary, mechanisms and controlled release formulations of these 2 drugs are available as a fixed dose combination, felodipine/metoprolol. In clinical trials in patients with hypertension, felodipine/metoprolol was significantly more effective than placebo and the respective monotherapies administered at the same dosages. Mean BP was reduced to < 155/90 mm Hg in patients treated with combination therapy and controlled in approximately 70% of patients. In one study that titrated dosages to effect, fewer felodipine/metoprolol than felodipine or metoprolol monotherapy recipients required dosage increases to achieve BP control (45 vs 60 and 67%, respectively). Data from double blind comparative studies show that the antihypertensive efficacy of felodipine/metoprolol 5 to 10/50 to 100 mg/day is significantly greater than that of enalapril monotherapy or captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide and equivalent to nifedipine/atenolol and amlodipine. In comparisons with enalapril, fewer felodipine/metoprolol than enalapril recipients required dosage titration to achieve BP control. Compared with amlodipine, felodipine/metoprolol significantly reduced mean 24-hour average BP (8.9/5.5 vs 14.4/9.5 mm Hg after 6 weeks; p < 0.001). Both treatments preserved diurnal rhythm. Long term follow-up studies show that the antihypertensive effect of felodipine/metoprolol occurs mostly during the first month of treatment with small additional decreases in BP being observed in the second and third months, and a relatively constant effect thereafter. According to a validated questionnaire, quality of life was relatively similar during 12 weeks treatment with felodipine/metoprolol, enalapril or placebo. In a retrospective pharmacoeconomic analysis conducted in Sweden, felodipine/metoprolol was more cost effective than enalapril as initial treatment for hypertension. Peripheral oedema, headache and flushing were the most commonly reported adverse events with felodipine/metoprolol and felodipine monotherapy, whereas dizziness, fatigue, headache and respiratory infection were more frequent with metoprolol monotherapy. Dose-dependent adverse events such as oedema may occur less often in patients taking lower dosages in combination than in those taking higher dosages of felodipine monotherapy. Thus, patients with hypertension treated with felodipine/metoprolol experience greater control of BP, with less need for dosage titration, than those treated with felodipine, metoprolol or enalapril monotherapy. Importantly this greater efficacy does not appear to be associated with a higher incidence of adverse events relative to monotherapy. Additionally, in short term studies felodipine/metoprolol had a similar (minimal) effect on QOL to enalapril monotherapy but was more cost effective.",I,8

Pharmacological therapy with beta-blockers is well established for preventing the first variceal bleeding. The utility of adding a vasodilator to beta-blockers needs to be studied further. Octreotide is widely used as an adjuvant to standard endoscopic treatment to prevent variceal rebleeding, and the utility of this approach has been validated in several randomized controlled trials. Band ligation is well established, and its popularity has increased with the introduction of multiple ligation devices. The technical simplicity and safety of band ligation has sparked interest in using this technique for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. However, randomized trials have not shown any advantage for band ligation over beta-blocker therapy, and the high variceal recurrence rate after band ligation may eliminate any theoretical advantage. A synchronous combination of band ligation and sclerotherapy has not been shown to improve the results of band ligation alone, but a metachronous approach using sclerotherapy to treat recurrent varices after band ligation has shown beneficial results. Histoacryl remains the best treatment option for gastric varices, but band ligation and loop ligation have shown promising results, and should be considered when Histoacryl is not available. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration is a new radiological modality for gastric varices, and one that sounds promising. TIPS is well established as an alternative to elective endoscopic treatment. Compared with endoscopic treatment, TIPS has been shown to improve the survival rate in one randomized trial. However, the cost and complications of TIPS have restricted its use. The use of endoscopic ultrasound for Doppler studies of blood flow in portal hypertension is currently investigational, but it may gain a role in selecting the optimal treatment approach for the individual patient.",I,8

The basic treatment was with Felodipin (5 mg q. d.): if the target pressure was not achieved, further steps were initiated: either ACE-inhibitors or -blockers were added, in a third step the Felodipindose was increased to 100 mg and in a further step the doses of ACE-inhibitors or -blockers were doubled. If target pressure was still not achieved, a diuretic was added. Furthermore half of the patients in all groups received either placebo or 75 mg acetyl-salicylic acid. To prevent cardiovascular events the best benefit was shown, when a diastolic pressure of 82.6 mm Hg was reached.

This meta-analysis aimed at clarifying their effect on sudden death, the magnitude of their benefit according to the cause of heart failure, and whether there is any difference between vasodilating and nonvasodilating agents.; Randomized, clinical trials were included if they evaluated a beta-adrenergic blocking agent without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, included a control group receiving placebo or standard treatment, evaluated mortality on an intention-to-treat basis, and lasted at least 8 weeks.; Twenty-one trials with 5,849 patients (3,130 receiving beta-blockers) were included. Median length of treatment was 6 months. Most patients had mild or moderate heart failure and were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis. The beta-blockers significantly reduced overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and mortality due to pump failure and sudden death by 34% to 39%. The decrease in overall mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) (30%) was no different from that among patients with non-IHD (26%) (P = .08).

The present study evaluates the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of amiodarone in patients with recent-onset AF (<48 hours). Seventy-two patients were randomized to receive 30 mg/kg of either amiodarone or placebo. Conversion to SR was verified by 24-hour Holter monitoring. Ten patients were excluded because of SR in the beginning of monitoring or technical failure during Holter monitoring. The remaining study groups were comparable (n = 31 for each), except that in the placebo group beta blockers were more common. The patients receiving amiodarone converted to SR more effectively than those receiving placebo (p<0.0001). At 8 hours, approximately 50% of patients in the amiodarone group and 20% in the placebo group (Holter successful) had converted to SR, whereas after 24 hours the corresponding figures were 87% and 35%, respectively. The median time for conversion (8.7 hours for amiodarone and 7.9 hours for placebo) did not differ in the groups. Amiodarone was hemodynamically well tolerated, and the number of adverse events in the study groups was similar. Amiodarone as a single oral dose of 30 mg/kg appears to be effective and safe in patients with recent-onset AF.",E,E

Reference lists from relevant papers and reviews were hand searched for further papers.; Eight studies pertaining to acute and twenty-four pertaining to chronic AF were identified. For patients with acute AF ventricular rate control, anticoagulation and treatment of heart failure should be pursued simultaneously before cardioversion is attempted. Digoxin is relatively ineffective at controlling ventricular response and for cardioversion. Intravenous diltiazem is rapidly effective in controlling ventricular rate and limited evidence suggests it is safe. Amiodarone controls ventricular rate rapidly and increases the rate of cardioversion. There are insufficient data to conclude that immediate anti-coagulation, trans-oesophageal echocardiography to exclude atrial thrombi followed by immediate cardioversion is an appropriate strategy. Patients with chronic AF should be anti-coagulated unless contra-indications exist. It is not clear whether the preferred strategy should be cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm with amiodarone or ventricular rate control of AF combined with anticoagulation to improve outcome including symptoms, morbidity and survival. Electrical cardioversion has a high initial success rate but there is also a high risk of early relapse. Amiodarone currently appears the most effective and safest therapy for maintaining sinus rhythm post-cardioversion. Digoxin is fairly ineffective at controlling ventricular rate during exercise. Addition of a beta-blocker reduces ventricular rate and improves symptoms. Whether digoxin is required in addition to beta-blockade for the control of AF in this setting is currently under investigation. If pharmacological therapy is ineffective or not tolerated then atrio-ventricular node ablation and permanent pacemaker implantation should be considered.; There is a paucity of controlled clinical trial data for the management of AF among patients with heart failure. The interaction between AF and heart failure means that neither can be treated optimally without treating both. Presently treatment should be on a case by case basis.",E,E

The short form 36 (SF-36) self-administered quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at randomization and three months, one year and three years later. To date, 98% of patients reached one year and 67% reached three years.; The PTCA group had significantly greater improvements in physical functioning, vitality and general health at both three months and one year, but not at three years. These quality-of-life scores were strongly related to breathlessness, angina grade and treadmill exercise time both at baseline and at one year. The treatment differences in quality of life are explained by the PTCA group's improvements in breathlessness, angina and exercise time. The attenuation of treatment difference at three years is partly attributed to 27% of medically treated patients receiving nonrandomized interventions in the interim. For both groups, there were also improvements in ratings of physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social functioning, pain and mental health, but for these the superiority of PTCA over medical treatment was less pronounced. After one year, 33% and 22% of the PTCA and medical groups, respectively, rated their health much better.; Coronary angioplasty substantially improves patient-perceived quality of life, especially physical functioning and vitality, as compared with continued medical treatment. These differences are attributed to alleviation of cardiac symptoms (specifically, breathlessness and angina), but must be balanced against the small procedure-related risks of PTCA.",E,E
10733260,Beta-blockers for congestive heart failure: what is the current consensus?,Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Heart Failure; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,"Tsuyuki, R T; McAlister, F A; Teo, K K","Despite the availability of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), mortality and morbidity remains unacceptably high. CHF is thought to progress as a result of activation of endogenous neurohormonal systems which are activated by the initial myocardial injury. The 2 neurohormonal systems which seem to be important in CHF are the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). While stimulation of the SNS has important circulatory support functions in the short term, long term activation appears to have deleterious effects on cardiac function and outcomes. The purpose of this article is to review the literature on the use of beta-blockers in patients with CHF. The published randomised clinical trials of beta-blockers in patients with CHF have shown very promising effects on mortality and morbidity. Several systematic overviews of these trials also suggest beneficial effects on mortality, hospitalisation for CHFE need for transplant, and ejection fraction. The effect of beta-blockers on exercise tolerance. New York Heart Association Function Class (NYHA-FC) and quality of life remain equivocal. The recent presentation of the results from several large-scale trials which were terminated early because of significant survival benefit, has removed any concern over the robustness of the mortality data. Available evidence suggests that a wide variety of patients with CHF, including the elderly, should be considered for beta-blocker therapy. Caution is warranted in the initiation and titration of therapy, as symptoms of CHF may transiently worsen. Whether all beta-blockers are equally efficacious remains unknown.",I,8

Two popular sets of weights are the harmonic means of the stratum-specific sample sizes (SSIZE) and the reciprocals of the variances of the stratum-specific differences (INVAR). Either the SSIZE or INVAR weights are chosen and prespecified in the data analysis plan. We show that the 'wrong' choice between SSIZE and INVAR can result in a significantly inefficient analysis. To circumvent this potential problem, we propose a 'minimum risk' (MR) weighting strategy. The easy-to-compute MR weights are designed to yield more precise and less biased estimates of the overall treatment difference relative to the SSIZE and INVAR weights, respectively. We show, via a simulation study, that the proposed weights are an attractive compromise between the SSIZE and INVAR weights in terms of statistical power. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the utility of the MR weights.",E,E

Clinical and echocardiographic variables were measured in the 2 groups at baseline and after 6 months and the results compared.; After 6 months of treatment with carvedilol, left ventricular ejection fraction had increased from 24% +/- 7% to 29% +/- 9% (P <.0001); this change was caused by a reduction in end-systolic volume index (106 +/- 41 vs 93 +/- 37 mL/m(2); P <. 0001). Deceleration time of early diastolic filling increased (134 +/- 74 vs 196 +/- 63 ms; P <.0001). Seventeen of the 27 patients with demonstrated improvement of left ventricular diastolic filling moved from having a restrictive filling pattern to having a normal or pseudonormal left ventricular filling pattern. In the control group, no significant changes in deceleration time of early diastolic filling were found (139 +/- 74 vs 132 +/- 45 ms; P = not significant). The effective regurgitant orifice area decreased significantly in the carvedilol group but not in the control group. These changes were associated with a significant reduction of the mitral regurgitant stroke volume in the carvedilol group (50 +/- 25 vs 16 +/- 13 mL; P <.0001) but not in the control group (57 +/- 29 vs 47 +/- 24 mL; P = not significant). These changes of mitral regurgitation were closely associated with significant improvement of forward aortic stroke volume (r = -.57, P <.0001). These findings were not observed in patients in the control group.; The results of this study show that long-term carvedilol therapy in patients with chronic heart failure was able to prevent or partially reverse progressive left ventricular dilatation. The effects on left ventricular remodeling were associated with a concomitant recovery of diastolic reserve and a decrease of mitral regurgitation, which have been demonstrated to be powerful prognostic predictors in such patients. Overall these findings provide important insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which carvedilol improves the clinical course of patients with chronic heart failure.",E,E

Exercise has a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects. It is used also as an adjunctive therapy in patients with CHF. We studied the effect of randomized treatment with celiprolol, a vasodilating beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, 200 mg once daily (n=20) or placebo (n=11) on serum lipid levels and insulin sensitivity in patients with CHF. In addition, all subjects participated in a 6-month exercise training protocol. Thirteen subjects in the celiprolol and eight subjects in the control group were on additional beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist as part of their tailored CHF therapy. Insulin sensitivity was determined using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test (diabetic subjects excluded, n=11 for the celiprolol group and n=8 for the placebo group).; Insulin sensitivity index (ISI) increased by 33% (P<0.05) in the celiprolol group and by 17% (NS) in the control group. The mean increase in the whole group was 20% [from 68.2+/-11.5 to 81.7+/-10.7 ml/min/kg (mU/l), P<0.05]. No change was found in the total cholesterol level. HDL cholesterol levels increased by 12% (from 0.98+/-0.05 to 1.10+/-0.05 mmol/l, P<0. 005), and HDL/total cholesterol and HDL/LDL cholesterol ratios by 15% and 16%, respectively (P<0.005). The increase in serum fasting HDL cholesterol level was greater in the celiprolol-treated group (P<0.05). At baseline ISI correlated with maximal oxygen uptake (r=0. 65, P<0.0001) and body mass index (r=-0.55, P<0.001). The change in ISI correlated weakly with the improvement in muscle exercise capacity (r=0.53, P<0.05).; Insulin sensitivity and serum lipid levels may be favorably affected by exercise training in subjects with mild-to-moderate CHF.

However, the possible mechanisms of this improvement and the effects of such treatment on regional wall motion have not been established. In a substudy of the Australia-New Zealand trial of carvedilol in patients with heart failure caused by ischemic heart disease, the effects of treatment on LV regional wall motion were assessed using 2-dimensional echocardiography.; One hundred nineteen patients from 10 centers were included on this substudy. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with carvedilol or placebo. Echocardiography was performed before randomization and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. LV regional wall motion was assessed using a semiquantitative scoring system. LV wall motion score index (WMSI) was reduced from 2.40 to 2.29 after 6 and 12 months in the carvedilol group and remained unchanged in the placebo group (2-tailed P = .005, carvedilol vs placebo). The percentage of myocardium with normal function also significantly improved with carvedilol treatment.; Carvedilol improved LV regional WMSI in patients with heart failure caused by ischemic heart disease. These results indicate a mechanism by which beta-blocker therapy may benefit patients with heart failure and are consistent with an intrinsic improvement in LV function after treatment with carvedilol.",E,E

This provides the basis for an evaluation of carvedilol for the prevention of coronary restenosis.; In a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 25 mg of carvedilol was given twice daily, starting 24 hours before scheduled directional coronary atherectomy and continuing for 5 months after a successful procedure. The primary end point was the minimal luminal diameter as determined during follow-up angiography 26+/-2 weeks after the procedure. Of 406 randomized patients, 377 underwent attempted atherectomy, and in 324 (88.9%), a </=50% diameter stenosis was achieved without the use of a stent.

Part of these beneficial effects may result from inhibition of deleterious neurohormone activation that accompanies progression of chronic heart failure. The present study evaluates whether this neurohormone inhibition is preserved after chronic beta-blockade.; In a retrospective analysis the neurohormonal profiles of patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure were studied from three treatment subgroups: (1) Without beta-blockers or ACE-inhibitors (n=15), (2) without beta-blockers, with ACE-inhibitors (n=324), (3) with beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors (n=31). Patients were on beta-blockers for an average period of 3.8 years. Plasma samples were obtained under controlled conditions.; Despite uneven group sizes, the groups were well matched for clinical characteristics. Plasma renin levels were significantly lower in patients treated adjunctively with beta-blockers. Plasma aldosterone and endothelin-I levels also tended to be lower after chronic beta-blockade, however, this did not reach statistical significance.; Chronic adjunctive beta-blocker treatment shows significantly lower plasma renin levels when compared to single ACE-inhibition. This persistent reduction of plasma neurohormone activation may concomitantly reduce the chance of neurohormones to escape from inhibition.",E,E

However, the long-term effects of this procedure on blood pressure are not well understood.; We randomly assigned 106 patients with hypertension who had atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis (defined as a decrease in luminal diameter of 50 percent or more) and a serum creatinine concentration of 2.3 mg per deciliter (200 micromol per liter) or less to undergo percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty or to receive drug therapy. To be included, patients also had to have a diastolic blood pressure of 95 mm Hg or higher despite treatment with two antihypertensive drugs or an increase of at least 0.2 mg per deciliter (20 micromol per liter) in the serum creatinine concentration during treatment with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor. Blood pressure, doses of antihypertensive drugs, and renal function were assessed at 3 and 12 months, and patency of the renal artery was assessed at 12 months.; At base line, the mean (+/-SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 179+/-25 and 104+/-10 mm Hg, respectively, in the angioplasty group and 180+/-23 and 103+/-8 mm Hg, respectively, in the drug-therapy group.

Two hundred nineteen patients (mean age, 60.2 years; age range, 49-81 years) were included in the study. Reasons for exclusion were: clinical data about hypertension were not available (n = 159); the patient had received or was receiving hormonal treatment (n = 78); the patient had undergone a hysterectomy (n = 25); and endometrial thickness could not be determined (n = 30).

This has been possible because of the better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to portal hypertension. A major step forward was the introduction of beta-blockers for the prevention of bleeding and rebleeding from gastroesophageal varices. Effective therapy requires the reduction of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) to 12 mmHg or below, or at least by 20% of baseline values. Unfortunately, this is only achieved in 1/3 to 1/2 of patients. Combination therapy, associating isosorbide-5-mononitrate and propranolol or nadolol administration enhances the reduction in portal pressure and increases the number of patients in whom HVPG decreases by more than 20% of baseline values and below 12 mmHg. Randomized clinical trials (RCT's) do support the concept that combination therapy is more effective than propranolol or nadolol alone, significantly better than sclerotherapy, and probably than endoscopic banding ligation. Therapy may be complemented by the association of spironolactone. The main inconvenience of pharmacological therapy is that there is no non-invasive method available to detect non-responders to treatment. Failures of drug therapy should be managed endoscopically. Failures of endoscopic treatment require 'rescue' by means of TIPS or shunt surgery. Patients with advanced liver failure should be considered for orthotopic liver transplantation, and put into a waiting list if eligible. In the treatment of acute variceal bleeding pharmacological therapy offer the unique advantage of allowing to provide specific therapy immediately after arrival to hospital, or even during transferral to hospital by ambulance, since it does not require sophisticated equipment and highly qualified medical staff. Vasopressin has been abandoned because of its toxicity, although this can be reduced by the combined administration of transdermal nitroglycerin. Terlipressin has longer effects and is more effective and safer than vasopressin alone or in combination with nitroglycerin. It has proved to be effective and to decrease mortality from bleeding in double-blind studies. RCT's have shown that this drug is as effective and safer than emergency sclerotherapy. Therapy should be maintained for five days to prevent early rebleeding. Somatostatin is probably as effective as terlipressin. Octreotide is probably useful after endoscopic therapy but can not be recommended as first line treatment. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy and endoscopic banding ligation are very effective, but require well trained medical staff. There is an increasing trend for initiating therapy with a pharmacological agent, followed by semi-emergency endoscopic therapy as soon as a well trained endoscopist is available (within 12-24 hours), while maintaining drug therapy for 5 days. Failures of medical therapy may be treated by a second session of endoscopic treatment, but if this fails TIPS of emergency surgery should be done. In high-risk situations, such as bleeding from gastric varices or in patients with advanced liver failure, the decision for TIPS or surgery should be done earlier, after failure of the initial treatment.",E,E
10776828,Pharmacological therapy for glaucoma: a review.,"Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Algorithms; Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors; Drug Therapy, Combination; Glaucoma; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Parasympathomimetics; Sympathomimetics","Hoyng, P F; van Beek, L M","For some time the medical treatment of glaucoma has consisted of topical beta-blockers, adrenergic agents, miotics and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs). However, the therapeutic arsenal available for the medical treatment of glaucoma has recently extended with new classes of ocular hypotensive agents i.e. prostaglandins, local CAIs and alpha2-adrenergic agents. Beta-blockers are still the mainstay in glaucoma treatment and are first line drugs. However, even if they are applied once daily, as with timolol in gel forming solution and levobunolol, the possible cardiopulmonary adverse effects of beta-blockers remain a cause for concern. When monotherapy with beta-blockers is ineffective in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) or is hampered by adverse effects, a change of monotherapy to prostaglandins, local CAIs, alpha2-adrenergic agonists (brimonidine) or to dipivalyl epinephrine is advised. Prostaglandins, local CAIs and alpha2-adrenergic agonists, such as brimonidine, may in time become first line drugs because they reduce IOP effectively and until now systemic adverse effects have rarely been reported with these agents. The development of a pro-drug of either a local CAI or an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with a sustained and continuous effect on IOP level, which could be applied once a day is suggested. Because of these new developments, miotics, i.e. pilocarpine and carbachol, are recommended as second or third line drugs. The cholinesterase inhibitors are considered third line drugs as better agents with fewer local and systemic adverse effects have become available. Oral CAIs may be used temporarily in patients with elevated IOPs e.g. postsurgery or post-laser, or continuously in patients with glaucoma resistant to other treatment. Combining ocular hypotensive drugs is indicated when the target pressure for an individual patient cannot be reached with monotherapy. Combination therapy of beta-blockers is additive with prostaglandins, topical CAIs and miotics. Prostaglandins such as latanoprost can be combined with beta-blockers, adrenergic agents, local CAIs and miotics. Combinations with brimonidine or local CAIs need further investigation.

This study was performed to evaluate whether myocardial IB analysis can predict the response to beta-blocker therapy.; We prospectively performed echocardiographic examination with IB analysis in 29 patients with DCM (20 men, 9 women) before starting bisoprolol therapy and in 15 normal subjects. Standard echocardiographic examination and IB analysis in the left ventricular wall in the 2-dimensional short-axis view were performed and the magnitude of cyclic variation (CV) of IB and calibrated myocardial IB intensity (subtracted pericardial) were obtained from the interventricular septum and the left ventricular posterior wall. Sixteen patients responded to bisoprolol therapy and 13 did not respond after 12 months of full-dose therapy. Calibrated myocardial IB intensity was lower in responders relative to nonresponders in both the interventricular septum (responders, -20.1 +/- 3.6 dB vs nonresponders, -9.8 +/- 5.1 dB, P <.0001; controls, -20.1 +/- 4.4 dB) and posterior wall (responders, -20.6 +/- 3.6 dB vs nonresponders, -14.6 +/- 4.2 dB, P =.0002; controls, -22.7 +/- 3.3 dB). Also, the lower the myocardial intensity in the interventricular septum or posterior wall, the better left ventricular systolic function improved after beta-blocker therapy. However, CV was lower in both DCM groups than in the controls, and CV in the interventricular septum was lower in nonresponders than in responders (responders, 4.0 +/- 4.1 dB vs nonresponders, -0.8 +/- 6. 1 dB, P <.02; controls, 8.3 +/- 2.4 dB). In addition, CV in the posterior wall showed no difference between the 2 DCM groups (responders, 5.6 +/- 1.3 dB vs nonresponders, 5.1 +/- 3.5 dB, P = not significant; controls, 9.6 +/- 2.5 dB). Also, the percent fibrosis on right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens showed no distinctions between these 2 groups (responders, 25.1% +/- 16.1% vs nonresponders, 24.9% +/- 15.0%, P = not significant).; These findings suggest that left ventricular myocardial IB data, especially IB intensity, provide useful information for predicting the response to beta-blocker therapy in patients with DCM. However, right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy findings do not appear to contribute to discriminating between the 2 groups.",E,E

Only diuretics and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce this risk in long-term clinical trials. Whether newer antihypertensive agents reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unknown.; To compare the effect of doxazosin, an alpha-blocker, with chlorthalidone, a diuretic, on incidence of CVD in patients with hypertension as part of a study of 4 types of antihypertensive drugs: chlorthalidone, doxazosin, amlodipine, and lisinopril.; Randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial, the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, initiated in February 1994. In January 2000, after an interim analysis, an independent data review committee recommended discontinuing the doxazosin treatment arm based on comparisons with chlorthalidone. Therefore, outcomes data presented herein reflect follow-up through December 1999.; A total of 625 centers in the United States and Canada.; A total of 24,335 patients (aged > or = 55 years) with hypertension and at least 1 other coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factor who received either doxazosin or chlorthalidone.; Participants were randomly assigned to receive chlorthalidone, 12.5 to 25 mg/d (n=15,268), or doxazosin, 2 to 8 mg/d (n=9067), for a planned follow-up of 4 to 8 years.; The primary outcome measure was fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), analyzed by intent to treat; secondary outcome measures included all-cause mortality, stroke, and combined CVD (CHD death, nonfatal MI, stroke, angina, coronary revascularization, congestive heart failure [CHF], and peripheral arterial disease); compared by the chlorthalidone group vs the doxazosin group.; Median follow-up was 3.3 years. A total of 365 patients in the doxazosin group and 608 in the chlorthalidone group had fatal CHD or nonfatal MI, with no difference in risk between the groups (relative risk [RR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-1.17; P=.71).

Patients were monitored in an intensive care unit and underwent 48-hour Holter monitoring to assess transient ischemia. Carvedilol as adjunctive therapy resulted in a significant reduction of median heart rate (65 vs 75 beats/min, p <0.05), mean systolic blood pressure (133 vs 130 mm Hg, p <0.05), and mean rate-pressure product (8,337 vs 10,042, p <0.05). Carvedilol reduced the ischemic burden during 48 hours of treatment by 75% (49 vs 204 minutes), including a 36% reduction of patients with ischemic episodes (p <0.05), a 66% reduction of the mean number of ischemic episodes (8 vs 24, p <0.05), and a 76% reduction in the mean duration of ischemic episodes (50 vs 205 minutes, p <0.05). Side effects occurred in 8 of 59 patients (13.6%) in the carvedilol group and in 5 of 54 patients (8.8%) given placebo. Although not significant, the early onset of maximal blood pressure reduction and the delayed effect on heart rate were closely correlated to drug-induced hypotension and bradycardia in the carvedilol group. Thus, carvedilol as an adjunctive to standardized treatment effectively reduces heart rate and blood pressure, and thus the ischemic burden in patients with unstable angina pectoris, but requires close monitoring of patients at risk for bradycardia or hypotension.",E,E

In fact, the degree of blood pressure control appears to be more important than the type of antihypertensive drugs used, and this conclusion is reinforced by the observation that numerous patients should rapidly be treated by more than one antihypertensive agent to reach blood pressure targets.",E,E

Patient recruitment was started in Norway and Sweden in September 1992, and ended on December 15, 1996, when 10.896 male and female patients, aged 50-74 years, with essential hypertension had been randomized. In this paper we describe the baseline data of the patient cohort and blood pressures achieved in the two treatment groups during the early part of the study. The patient cohort consists of 5294 males and 5602 females with a mean age of 59.6 and 60.3 years, respectively. Concomitant disorders and risk factors in the cohort are: smoking 22%, ischemic heart disease 3.0%, previous myocardial infarction (MI) 2.0%, previous stroke 1.5%, diabetes mellitus 7.0%, and renal impairment 0.3%. There were no differences between the treatment groups in these respects. The blood pressure treatment goal is a target diastolic blood pressure of < or =90 mmHg or a 10% diastolic blood pressure reduction from the inclusion pressure. In the treatment group randomized to a diltiazem-based treatment strategy, blood pressure was 174/106 mmHg at baseline and 156/90 mmHg after 12 months of follow-up on active treatment. In the group randomized to a conventional treatment strategy, baseline blood pressure at randomization was 173/106 mmHg and 153/90 mmHg after 12 months on active therapy.

During a median follow-up of 40 months, 32 patients suffered a cardiovascular death and 29 a non-fatal myocardial infarction.; Prognostic implications of results from exercise tests were assessed in a multivariate Cox model which included sex, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Maximal ST-segment depression, especially if >/=2 mm and occurring after exercise, as well as exercise duration independently predicted cardiovascular death. Similar results were obtained for the combined end-point of cardiovascular death+myocardial infarction. Among patients with a positive exercise test at baseline, verapamil reduced the maximal ST-depression more markedly than metoprolol (P<0. 01). However, when the treatment given and treatment effects on ST-segment depression were added to the Cox model, no impact on prognosis could be detected for either cardiovascular death alone or combined with myocardial infarction. Anginal pain carried no prognostic information.; Marked ST-segment depression during and after exercise, and a low exercise capacity independently predicted an adverse outcome in patients with stable angina pectoris, whereas anginal symptoms had no predictive value. Short-term treatment effects on ischaemia did not seem to influence prognosis. Post-exercise ischaemia should be examined carefully when evaluating patients with stable angina pectoris.",E,E

Single oral doses of placebo/placebo, metoprolol (50 mg)/placebo, verapamil (80 mg)/placebo, or verapamil/metoprolol were separated by at least 14 days. Liver blood flow through individual hepatic vessels was measured up to 8 hours after dosage administration using a duplex Doppler ultrasound technique. Cardiac output, heart rate, blood pressure, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance were measured for 3 hours after drug doses were given. In 5 subjects, pharmacokinetic parameters for total drug as well as S- and R-enantiomers were also measured. Verapamil given alone caused a rapid and intense increase in liver blood flow (hepatic artery = 50%, portal vein = 42%, hepatic vein = 55%) 0.75 to 1 hour after administration because of a decrease in total peripheral resistance and an increase in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output. Metoprolol given alone caused a slow but prolonged decrease in liver blood flow (maximum decrease: hepatic artery = -54%, portal vein = -21%, hepatic vein = -27%) 4 hours after administration because of a decrease in heart rate and cardiac output. When the two agents were given together, a composite of the changes noted after separate administration was noted: a brief peak increase in liver blood flow at 0.33 to 1 hour followed by a slow, prolonged decrease that reached its maximum decline 4 to 5 hours postdose. During the combined phase, metoprolol and its enantiomers had an increased AUC and Cmax, while verapamil and its enantiomers had an increased AUC and t1/2. These pharmacokinetic changes were consistent with the magnitude and time course of liver blood flow changes through the hepatic artery and portal or hepatic veins.",E,E

However, the impact of the method and the use of normalized power units in long-term ECG monitoring is still debated. Autoregressive and Fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectral approaches were applied to assess circadian modulation and the effect of beta-blocker administration in mild hypertensive patients who underwent continuous ambulatory ECG recording (n = 44, 51 +/- 12 years, 30 men). Spectral analysis was applied to 5-minute sequences and spectral parameters representative of each circadian period (24 hour, day, night) were calculated. In baseline recordings, FFT spectral method provided a smaller estimate of total and very low frequency powers. On the contrary, low- and high-frequency components were systematically larger with FFT. Circadian variations were in favor of an increased overall nocturnal variability but of a reduced low frequency normalized power with both spectral methods. Chronic oral administration of beta-blocker induced an increase of all spectral components except for an unchanged low-frequency normalized power, independently from the spectral approach. In spite of quantitative differences, the qualitative assessment of circadian patterns and beta-blockade effect by autoregressive- and FFT-based spectral analyses is equivalent. The low-frequency component of heart rate variability cannot be considered a reliable direct marker of sympathetic activity in long-term ambulatory ECG recording.",E,E

Placebo control may be useful in disease states, such as stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension as defined by the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI), in which response rates for placebo are high or close to response rates for effective therapies, or when established interventions have significant adverse effects.; To compare rates for the control of blood pressure and adverse effects of placebo vs active treatment in patients with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension.; This study is a randomized controlled trial evaluating the blood pressure response and adverse effects of placebo vs 6 active treatments administered in 15 Veterans Affairs hypertension centers. The 1292 subjects of the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study receiving single-drug therapy for hypertension were randomly allocated to receive treatment with 1 of 6 active drugs (n= 1105) or placebo (n=187). Treatment success was defined as maintaining a diastolic blood pressure of less than 95 mm Hg for at least 1 year. We compared treatment success rates for the control of blood pressure and adverse effects of placebo vs active treatment. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we also compared rates of discontinuation from placebo vs active drug treatment over time as a result of adverse drug effects and blood pressure exceeding safety limits.; At the end of the titration phase, 58 patients who were treated with placebo (31%) achieved a goal diastolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg and 57 (30%) achieved success at 1 year. Older white patients who received placebo had a success rate of 38% vs 23% to 27% for the other age-race subgroups. The rates of discontinuation as a result of adverse drug effects were 13% for patients receiving placebo vs 12% for patients receiving active treatment (P=.40). The rates of discontinuation for blood pressure being too high were 14% for patients receiving placebo vs 7% for patients receiving active treatment (P=.01).; Placebo control provides an important benchmark for both efficacy and adverse effects. It continues to have an appropriate place in certain therapeutic trials, particularly those involving the treatment of stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension.",E,E

Their severity, in turn, can be measured by assessing the distress that they cause. Our goal was to relate the magnitude of the distress induced by treatment with calcium-channel blocking agents to the change in quality of life assessed through psychosocial instruments in patients treated with calcium-channel blocking agents, either for hypertension or for angina pectoris.; Four hundred seventy-five patients with angina pectoris were randomized to double-blind treatment with PPR (physiological pattern release) verapamil hydrochloride, amlodipine besylate, amlodipineatenolol combination, or placebo. In addition, 557 hypertensive patients were randomized either to PPR verapamil or nifedipine GITS (gastrointestinal system). Both studies were double-blind.; Significant differences in treatment of angina pectoris or hypertension, were not found between the regimens. Overall quality of life also failed to show a significant difference in either group. In both groups, however, remarkable concordance was found between the degree of distress associated with specific symptoms and a change in quality of life. An unchanged, stable symptom distress was associated with a significant improvement in the quality of life of about 0.1 SD. Improvement or erosion of symptom distress represented by 1 step was associated with a 0.1- to 0.2-SD change. The extreme change in symptom distress was associated with a substantially larger change in global quality of life.; The magnitude of symptom distress or relief associated with symptoms in 2 patient populations correlated strongly with a shift in quality of life. The assessment of distress associated with symptoms provides valuable additional information on drug therapy.",E,E

The aim of this study was to evaluate the response of aldosterone biosynthesis and production to a sustained exposure to the stroke-permissive Japanese-style diet (JD) in young stroke-prone and stroke-resistant SHRs. For this purpose, 6-week old male rats from both strains were divided into 2 dietary groups and received regular diet (SHR = 37, SHRsp = 32) or the JD and 1% saline to drink (SHR = 34, SHRsp = 30) for 4 weeks. All measurements were carried out at the end of the dietary periods. After JD, plasma aldosterone levels were significantly decreased in SHR (from 357.8 +/- 57 to 163.3 +/- 31.5 pg/ml, p < 0.05) but markedly increased in SHRsp (from 442 +/- 56.5 to 739 +/- 125.7 pg/ml, p < 0.05). Consistently, the adrenal aldosterone synthase expression was reduced by JD in SHR (p < 0.05), whereas it was even slightly raised by JD in SHRsp so that, at the end of JD, aldosterone synthase mRNA was 5-fold higher in SHRsp than in SHR. Urinary sodium excretion (mEq/24h) achieved lower levels in SHRsp, so that fractional excretion of sodium was 80.2 +/- 9% in SHR and 40.3 +/- 8% in SHRsp (p < 0.05) in balance studies performed at the end of JD. These different responses of mineralocorticoid biosynthesis and urinary sodium excretion to JD were not accounted for by different adaptations of the renin-angiotensin and atrial natriuretic peptide systems, of serum potassium levels, or of adrenal 11beta-hydroxylase expression in the two strains. Systolic blood pressure was comparable in both strains throughout the experiment. These results demonstrate enhanced aldosterone biosynthesis, associated with reduced urinary excretion of sodium in response to JD in SHRsp before the onset of stroke. This abnormality may play a role in the higher susceptibility to stroke of this model.",I,8

Since inflammation of the vessel wall is a hallmark of atherosclerosis, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of ET-1 on cytokine production in human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) as a marker of inflammatory cell activation. ET-1 (100 pM - 1 microM) stimulated interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion from human vascular SMC in a concentration-dependent manner. The ET-A-receptor antagonist BQ-123 (10 microM), but not the ET-B-receptor antagonist BQ-788, inhibited IL-6 release. ET-1 also transiently increased IL-6 mRNA compatible with regulation of IL-6 release at the pretranslational level. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated time- and concentration-dependent activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in ET-1-stimulated human vascular SMC. A decoy oligodeoxynucleotide bearing the NF-kappaB binding site inhibited ET-1-stimulated IL-6 release to a great extent suggesting that this transcription factor plays a key role for cytokine production elicited by ET-1. Moreover, the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (10 microM) inhibited ET-1-induced IL-6 release indicating involvement of reactive oxygen species in ET-1 signaling. ET-1-stimulated IL-6 secretion was also suppressed by diphenylene iodonium (40 microM), an inhibitor of flavon-containing enzymes such as NADH/NADPH oxidase. The results demonstrate the ability of ET-1 to induce an inflammatory response in human vascular SMC. These observations may contribute to a better understanding of the role of ET-1 in inflammatory activation of the vessel wall during atherogenesis.",I,I

Ninety-five cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding were randomly assigned to treatment with PR + IM (46 patients) or PR alone (49 patients). Eighteen patients in the PR + IM group and 28 in the PR group had rebleeding during the 2 years after randomization. The actuarial probability of rebleeding 2 years after randomization was lower in the PR + IM group (40.4% vs. 57.4%) but the difference was not significant (P =. 09). However, the decrease in the risk of rebleeding reached statistical significance after stratification according to age, i.e. less than 50 versus >/=50 years old, (P =.03) or by adding an additional year of follow-up (P =.05). No significant difference was found in rebleeding index and survival. The multivariate Cox analysis indicated first, that both treatment (P =.03) and age (P =. 001) were factors predictive of rebleeding and second, that PR + MI reduced the risk of rebleeding by half (relative risk: 0.51, 95% confidence interval: 0.28-0.95). Seven patients in the PR + MI group and 1 patient in the PR group had to discontinue one of the drugs because of adverse events (P =.03). These results suggest that the addition of IM improves the efficacy of PR alone in the prevention of variceal rebleeding in cirrhotic patients. However no beneficial effects were observed on other parameters reflecting the efficacy of treatment.",E,E

Elderly patients are more likely to have comorbid disorders, such as dyslipidaemia, diabetes, renal disease, atherosclerosis and, for males, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Therefore, when choosing an antihypertensive agent for elderly patients, it is particularly important to ensure that treatment does not exacerbate comorbid conditions and does not interact deleteriously with any concurrent medication that the patient is taking. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, doxazosin, has been shown to be an effective, well-tolerated antihypertensive therapy in elderly male patients and does not exacerbate--and in some cases improves--some other common disorders. Doxazosin has been shown to be effective in reducing the symptoms of BPH in elderly patients whose blood pressure is well controlled by concomitant antihypertensive medication. In addition, improvements in the symptoms of BPH as well as reductions in blood pressure have been observed in elderly men with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Doxazosin has been shown to have positive effects on lipid profiles and glycaemic control, which make it an attractive choice of therapy for elderly patients with hypertension and diabetes or dyslipidaemia. In addition, doxazosin is administered once daily, either in the morning or the evening, which may aid compliance, an important consideration in the elderly.",3,E

Because this was a retrospective analysis, there were unavoidable differences in the backgrounds of the patients in the 2 groups. Subgroup analyses, each focusing on a specific patient characteristic, were therefore performed. These showed that metoprolol effectively reduced cardiac events in many subgroups. Furthermore, multivariate analysis carried out to exclude any modification based on the differences in patient background confirmed metoprolol to be effective in reducing subsequent cardiac events in post-myocardial infarction patients.

The present study was designed to assess whether a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist-based or an ACE inhibitor-based treatment was able to reduce carotid artery wall hypertrophy through a reduction in carotid PP rather than by lowering mean BP and whether the influence of local PP reduction could also be detected at the site of a muscular artery, the radial artery.; Ninety-eight essential hypertensive patients were randomized to 9 months of double-blind treatment with either celiprolol or enalapril. Arterial parameters were determined with high-resolution echo-tracking systems. PP was measured locally with applanation tonometry and independently of mean BP. After 9 months of treatment, mean BP, carotid PP, and intimal-medial thickness (IMT) decreased significantly, with no difference between the 2 groups. The reduction in carotid PP but not in mean BP was a major independent determinant of the reduction in carotid IMT. Radial artery IMT and PP decreased significantly with both treatments. However, the reduction in radial artery IMT was not related to the changes in radial artery PP.; The regression of carotid artery wall hypertrophy during long-term antihypertensive treatment was dependent on the reduction in local PP rather than on the lowering of mean BP.

Labetalol plasma concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and labetalol stereoisomer ratios were determined in a single plasma sample by chiral HPLC, both with fluorescence detection.; Labetalol concentrations were 80% higher in women (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]/dose x 1000: 6.79 +/- 2.11 in women vs 3.82 +/- 1.37 hr/L in men, p<0.05), yet both genders had a similar antihypertensive response by 24-hour ABPM.

However, concentrations were similar between genders for the beta-blocking stereoisomer (R,R-labetalol), possibly explaining the similarity in antihypertensive response to the drug. This study highlights the importance of determining stereoisomer kinetics for agents administered as racemates, particularly when relating concentrations to pharmacologic response.",E,E

A MEDLINE search (January 1998-July 1999) was performed and abstracts from the 1999 American College of Cardiology and 1998 American Heart Association annual scientific sessions were reviewed to identify pertinent studies. Material for discussion was identified through a MEDLINE search from January 1996-July 1999 and through cited references. The results of several studies added to our understanding of the clinical ramifications of an aspirin-ACE inhibitor interaction, but also introduced questions. These studies are largely contradictory, but do reiterate the possibility of an interaction, if only in certain subsets of patients. Low dosages (< or = 100 mg/day) of aspirin appear to be safer in this regard than higher dosages. The frequency and severity of the interaction and possible predisposing factors await future research.",E,E

Antihypertensive intervention reduces the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aims of the study were to evaluate the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and the blood pressure (BP), and to evaluate the percentage of patients who had achieved a BP level as recommended by the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI). BP was evaluated in relation to age, body mass index, duration of hypertension, cholesterol and triglyceride level, smoking status, information of regular exercise, a family history of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and drug treatment, in 220 men treated for arterial hypertension. In the univariate analyses we found a higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) with older age, higher SBP in smoking patients and lower SBP in patients with regular exercise. In a multivariate model age (p = 0.0004), smoking status (p = 0.01) and regular exercise (p= 0.06) were independently associated with SBP. There was a lower diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with older age, and age was independently associated with DBP. Office SBP was above 140 mmHg in 83% and above 160 mmHg in 44% of patients. During ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (AMBP), SBP was above 135 mmHg in 40% and above 155 mmHg in 15% of patients. In addition to male sex and hypertension there was a high percentage of other cardiovascular risk factors--43% was smoking, 21% had a family history of IHD, 77% had a se-cholesterol above 5.5 mmol/l and 48% had a se-triglyceride above 1.6 mmol/l. In a consecutive group of asymptomatic male treated hypertensive patients SBP is independently associated with age and smoking status, and DBP with age. A high percentage of the patients do not have a well controlled BP, and a high percentage have additional risk factors such as smoking, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and a family history of IHD. This means that there is room for much improvement in the control of hypertension.",E,E

A number of differences in the results noted could be due to additional properties of the specific beta blockers studied: absence of cardioselectivity, and existence of a vasodilator effect and of an associated antioxidant effect. We studied the effects of celiprolol, a cardioselective beta blocker with a stimulant effect on beta2 receptors. One hundred thirty-two patients presenting with chronic heart failure of various etiologies, with an ejection fraction of <40% and New York Heart Association cardiac functional status grades II and III were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The maximum dose of celiprolol (100 mg) was attained after 1 month. The study lasted 1 year. The primary evaluation criterion was functional class as evaluated using the Goldman questionnaire. There was no difference in efficacy between the 2 treatment groups in terms of functional class (p = 0.56). With regard to the secondary evaluation criteria, an improvement in DiBianco functional score was seen with celiprolol (p = 0.03), as well as a significant reduction in heart rate (p = 0.01). Ejection fraction increased in both groups (p = 0.15). There was no difference regarding improvement in left ventricular volume as determined at echocardiography or in exercise capacity. The safety profile of celiprolol was excellent. There was no difference in terms of cardiovascular mortality (2 receiving celiprolol vs 4 placebo), onset of arrhythmias (2 receiving celiprolol vs 3 placebo), worsening of heart failure (26 receiving celiprolol vs 23 placebo), or noncardiovascular adverse events (9 receiving celiprolol vs 14 placebo). The absence of a significant efficacy of celiprolol, a beta blocker with vasodilator properties, but exerting stimulation of beta2 receptors, suggests an unfavorable role of this latter property in heart failure. However, the safety profile of celiprolol was excellent. This beta blocker may consequently be used for its other indications, hypertension and angina, in patients presenting with altered cardiac function.",E,E

Studies with a particular interest for heart failure physicians have been reviewed. OPTIME-CHF: Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure. OPTIME-CHF was a randomised-controlled trial comparing a 48-h infusion of Milrinone or standard therapy in 951 patients recruited over a 2-year period. Patients were excluded if the investigator believed their clinical condition mandated inotropic therapy. Patients were randomised within 48 h of admission for an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure to receive Milrinone or placebo infision for 48 h. Of the patients 43% were diabetics, 70% were receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, 25% were already on a beta-Blocker, and 34% had atrial fibrillation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in length of hospital stay during the index admission, subsequent readmissions and days in hospital over the following 60 days. Subjective clinical assessment scores were also no different. There was an average admission rate over the next year of one per patient in both groups. However, there was a significant increase in the incidence of sustained hypotension in the Milrinone group, which accounted for all of the increased adverse event rates for the active therapy. The 60-day mortality was 10% in both groups. This and previous trials of the oral formulation of Milrinone have now clearly demonstrated a lack of benefit with Milrinone in either during acute exacerbations of or in stable severe chronic heart failure [Packer M, Carver JR, Rodeheffer RJ et al. Effect of oral Milrinone on mortality in severe chronic heart failure. N Engl J Med 1991;325:1468-1475.]. Medium sized studies of Milrinone in patients with milder severities of heart failure also suggested an adverse impact on prognosis in the presence or absence of digoxin [DiBianco R, Shabetai R, Kostuk W, Moran J, Schlant RC, Wright R. A comparison of oral Milrinone, digoxin, and their combination in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. N Engl J Med 1989;320:677-683.].

Adverse events and mean changes in heart rate and blood pressure from baseline were the primary safety variables.; Timolol-treated subjects concurrently taking systemic beta-blockers had smaller decreases in IOP, a greater mean change in systolic (at week 2, months 1, 2, 6, and 9; P < or = 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (months 2 and 6; P < or = 0.02), and a significantly greater mean decrease in heart rate (month 6; P = 0.004) compared with timolol subjects not taking systemic beta-blockers. By contrast, there was a modest enhancement of IOP-lowering efficacy at trough and no effect on blood pressure or heart rate in brimonidine-treated subjects who were concurrently receiving systemic beta-blocker therapy compared with brimonidine subjects not receiving systemic beta-blockers.; Concurrent systemic beta-blocker therapy had no deleterious effect on ocular hypotensive efficacy and no impact on systemic safety parameters with topical brimonidine, whereas efficacy was reduced and systemic safety parameters were impacted with topical timolol.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend that persons without contraindications to use of beta-blockers should be administered beta-blockers within a few days of myocardial infarction (if administration is not initiated acutely) and that their administration should be continued indefinitely. These guidelines also recommend the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in treating persons within the first 24 h of suspected onset of acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation in two or more anterior precordial leads or with congestive heart failure in the absence of significant hypotension or other contraindications to use of ACE inhibitors; and persons during and after convalescence from acute myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure associated with an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a LVEF < 40%. These guidelines state that there are no class I indications for using calcium antagonists after myocardial infarction. If patients have persistent angina pectoris after myocardial infarction despite treatment with beta-blockers and nitrates or hypertension inadequately controlled by other drugs, administration of a nondihydropyridine calcium antagonist such as verapamil or diltiazem should be added to the therapeutic regimen if the LVEF is normal.

We reviewed the clinical, hemodynamic, and electrophysiologic variables at the time of pacemaker implantation in 204 patients enrolled in the PASE trial and randomized to the VVIR mode, some of whom subsequently required crossover (reprogramming) to DDDR pacing. During a median follow-up of 555 days, 53 patients (26%) crossed over from VVIR to DDDR pacing. A decrease in systolic blood pressure during ventricular pacing at the time of pacemaker implantation (p = 0.001), use of beta blockers at the time of randomization (p = 0.01), and nonischemic cardiomyopathy (p = 0.04) were the only variables that predicted crossover in the Cox multivariate regression model. After reprogramming to the dual-chamber mode, patients showed improvement in all aspects of quality of life, with significant improvements in physical and emotional role. The high incidence of crossover from VVIR to DDDR pacing along with significant improvements in quality of life after crossover to DDDR pacing strongly favors dual-chamber pacing compared with single-chamber ventricular pacing in elderly patients requiring permanent pacing.",E,E

Patients with a sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) of 160-205 mmHg, and a sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) < 90 mmHg at screening and at placebo baseline were subjected to a 4-week placebo period and then randomly grouped to receive 50 mg losartan or 50 mg atenolol once daily for 16 weeks. At 8 and 12 weeks, patients not controlled (SiDBP > or = 160 mmHg) were given additional treatment of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) once daily.; Similar significant reductions in SiSBPs (mean +/- SD) were obtained with 50 mg losartan and 50 mg atenolol, from 173.7 +/- 10.3 and 173.5 +/- 10.7 mmHg at baseline to 149.0 +/- 15.5 and 148.2 +/- 15.3 mmHg after 16 weeks of losartan or atenolol treatment respectively. Sixty-seven percent of the losartan-treated and 64% of the atenolol-treated patients remained on monotherapy throughout the study. Only 1.5% of the losartan-treated patients withdrew because of a clinical adverse event (CAE) compared with 7.2% in the atenolol-treatment group (P= 0.035). Drug-related CAEs were observed significantly more frequently with atenolol than with losartan treatment (20.3 versus 10.4%; P = 0.029).; It is concluded that 50 mg losartan and 50 mg atenolol produced comparable reductions in SiSBP in patients with ISH but losartan was better tolerated. This is the first demonstration of the therapeutic value of selective Ang II receptor blockade with losartan in the treatment of ISH.",I,E

One eye of each patient was randomly chosen for analysis, performed using analysis of variance and the chi(2) test.; Latanoprost had the greatest mean IOP lowering effect in both the primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) (p = 0.005) and the ""presumed"" normal tension glaucoma (NTG) groups (p = 0.33), reducing the IOP by 8.9 mm Hg and 4.1 mm Hg respectively. Timolol was associated with lowered pulse rates and reductions in the spirometry measurements. 41% of patients using brimonidine complained of systemic side effects and over 55% of patients using betaxolol complained of ocular irritation. 28% of patients required an alteration in their glaucoma management.; Latanoprost appears to be a useful primary treatment for glaucoma patients, in view of superior IOP control and a low incidence of local and systemic side effects. Timolol causes a reduction in measurements of respiratory function, a concern in view of the potential subclinical reversible airways disease in the elderly glaucoma population. Brimonidine is associated with substantial, unpredictable systemic side effects and betaxolol causes ocular irritation and weak IOP control.

Two hundred nineteen patients were enrolled--111 in the brimonidine group and 108 in the timolol group. Patients instilled their study medications twice daily for 4 months. Factors for determining clinical success were reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP), safety, and adverse events. Quality of life effects were assessed with the SF-36 Health Survey and Glaucoma Disability Index questionnaires.; Clinical success was 71% (75/106) with brimonidine and 70% (73/105) with timolol as initial treatment. The overall mean decrease in IOP was 6.5 mm Hg with brimonidine and 6.2 mm Hg with timolol. Few patients reported a specific adverse event and, with the exception of a slightly higher rate of ocular burning and stinging in the brimonidine group, there were no significant between-group differences. No significant chronotropic effects on the heart were seen with brimonidine, while small but significant mean decreases in heart rate were seen at months 1 and 4 with timolol. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained relatively stable in both groups. Quality of life remained stable, with no significant between-group differences.; As a first-line agent for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, brimonidine has clinical effectiveness equivalent to timolol, but with less chronotropic effect on the heart.

The effects of COER-verapamil were compared with placebo, nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS), amlodipine, and the combination of amlodipine and atenolol.; In patients with angina (n = 498), the change from baseline in HR following 4 weeks of treatment was -6.7 +/- 10.5 beats/min in the COER-verapamil group, -10.8 +/- 10.8 beats/min in the amlodipine/atenolol group, + 2.5 +/- 9.1 beats/ min in the amlodipine monotherapy group, and -1.3 +/- 10.5 beats/min in the placebo group (p<0.001). Data were stratified based on whether patients experienced asymptomatic ischemia during baseline ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. The circadian HR pattern was morphologically similar in all groups; however, differences in the magnitude of HR response were evident. In the subset of patients with asymptomatic ischemia (n = 101), treatment with amlodipine monotherapy increased HR compared with placebo. In this same subset of patients, HR reductions were achieved with COER-verapamil and amlodipine/atenolol.

This treatment strategy does not provide short-term hemodynamic improvement and may even worsen symptoms initially. However, beta-blockers can be administered with good or even excellent tolerability by slowly withdrawing adrenergic support to the failing heart. Results of clinical trials have shown that long-term treatment with beta-blockers improves ventricular function and reduces mortality rates in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure. Although the improvement in ventricular function is a beta-blocker class effect, there are distinct differences in antiadrenergic activity and tolerability among the first-, second-, and third-generation agents. These differences--as well as practical strategies for dose titration and the management of decompensation--are the focus of this article.",E,E

After analysing the data, it is clear that there is no role for class I antiarrhythmic agents as prophylaxis after MI since their use has been associated with increased mortality. Class II agents, i.e. beta-blockers, have demonstrated a reduction in mortality in combined and individual trials which extended for up to 6 years after the initial event. The class III drug, d,l-sotalol has been shown to have possible benefit, whereas its isomer without any beta-blocking properties, dexsotalol, has been shown to increase the incidence of arrhythmias. Amiodarone appears to reduce the incidence of deaths due to arrhythmia and sudden deaths without changing overall mortality. As a group, the calcium antagonists, class IV agents, have not been shown to reduce mortality and, in the case of nifedipine, may even increase it. Verapamil has been shown to be beneficial in one large study and may have a role in those patients in whom the use of beta-blockers is contraindicated. At this time, we recommend early implementation of beta-blockers for all patients without contraindications after MI.

The study was performed in general practitioners offices in Germany from 1991 to 1997. A total of 1298 patients with essential hypertension were included. Cardio- and cerebrovascular events, total mortality/morbidity and drug-saving effects in hypertensives treated according to two different methods of blood pressure measurement were the primary and secondary endpoints of the study. A total of 239 patients from group 1 (ABPM, n = 651), and 208 from group 2 (PM, n = 647) prematurely discontinued the study. The reason for discontinuation in 55 of these patients (20 from group 1 and 35 from group 2) was that they reached the main endpoint (total mortality/morbidity and cardio- and cerebrovascular events) of the study. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.037) in favour of group 1. Cardio- and cerebrovascular events also occurred in a lower number of patients (n = 14) in group 1, as compared to group 2 (n = 24). The difference however was not significant (P = 0. 097). A difference in a direct drug-saving effect could not be observed between the two groups but 22% of the initially screened patients were detected with the ABPM to have white coat hypertension and thus these patients did not receive antihypertensive treatment.",E,E

At the beginning and after one year, blood pressure biochemical profile and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) were measured. After the initial evaluation, 53 patients received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and 53 beta-blockers (BB). Hydrochlorothiazide was added to achieve the blood pressure target < 140/90 mmHg.; The average of UAE was 32.1 (43.1) mg/24 h, and 41 (39%) patients had microalbuminuretics.

The changes of UAE were only related with the baseline UAE values. Neither, age, sex, baseline diastolic BP and changes in diastolic BP were significantly related with the changes in UAE. In spite of similar mean BP reduction (medial BP 17.4 [10.9] vs 14.8 [10.4] mmHg), UAE only was reduced in patients treated with ACEi (LogUAE: 0.203 [0.872] mg/24 h; p < 0.04).

When compared with metoprolol (124+/-55 mg/d), patients treated with carvedilol (49+/-18 mg/d) showed larger increases in left ventricular ejection fraction at rest (+10.9+/-11.0 versus +7.2+/-7.7 U, P=0.038) and in left ventricular stroke volume and stroke work during exercise (both P<0. 05) after 13 to 15 months of treatment.

In contrast, the metoprolol group showed greater increases in maximal exercise capacity than the carvedilol group (P=0.035), but the 2 drugs improved symptoms, submaximal exercise tolerance, and quality of life to a similar degree. After a mean of 23+/-11 months of follow-up, 21 patients in the metoprolol group and 17 patients in the carvedilol group died or underwent urgent transplantation.; The present study demonstrates that during long-term therapy, carvedilol improves cardiac performance to a greater extent than metoprolol when administered to patients with heart failure in the doses shown to be effective in clinical trials. These differences were likely related to a greater antiadrenergic activity of carvedilol.",I,I

Patients able to tolerate low doses of carvedilol were randomized to treatment with carvedilol or placebo for 6 months. Carvedilol treatment improved ventricular function and reduced the incidence of arrhythmic episodes. Notably, by the end of the first month of treatment, the antiarrhythmic efficacy of the drug was significantly greater in patients with ischaemic than in those with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, an effect that could probably be attributed to the anti-ischaemic properties of carvedilol. After 3 months, at a time when ejection fraction was significantly improved in all treated patients, the antiarrhythmic efficacy of carvedilol was similar in the two study groups.; Carvedilol antiarrhythmic efficacy was paralleled by the improvement in ejection fraction, independent of the aetiology of heart failure.

The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of atenolol (beta1-blocker agent) and irbesartan (angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist) on plasma levels of hemostatic/fibrinolytic and endothelial function markers in a cohort of previously untreated hypertensives. Fifty-four patients were randomly assigned to atenolol 25 to 150 mg (26 patients) or irbesartan 75 to 300 mg (28 patients). The plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen, thrombomodulin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor antigen, fibrinogen, and factor XII were determined before and after 6 months of therapy. Age, gender distribution, body mass index, lipid profile, and baseline values of the measured markers were similar in both groups. Baseline values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as the reduction after treatment, were not significantly different between the two groups. Treatment with irbesartan was associated with a significant decrease in the levels of all the parameters. Similar findings were observed in the atenolol group, except for factor XII and tissue factor pathway inhibitor levels, which were not significantly decreased in this group. The reduction, however, of fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and thrombomodulin was significantly greater in the irbesartan than in the atenolol group. In conclusion, the results indicated that, despite an equally controlled blood pressure, 6-month therapy with irbesartan was associated with a more favorable modification of hemostatic/fibrinolytic status than atenolol.",E,E

Efforts to reduce that risk have led to recommendations for a wide array of nondrug and drug therapies. Choosing the optimal first-line drug for hypertensive patients should address a hierarchy of treatment goals: decrease in morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension, decrease in blood pressure, good tolerance, dosing convenience and low cost. This article examines the evidence for beta-blockers as a class of first-line antihypertensive drugs in light of these treatment goals. The evidence indicates that beta-blockers are probably not as effective in reducing morbidity and mortality as low-dose thiazide diuretics and that there may be significant differences in effectiveness among various beta-blockers.",5,E

We now know that beta-blockers are highly effective for the management of patients with chronic stable heart failure. However, there remains uncertainty about their role in the setting of post-infarction heart failure and ventricular dysfunction.; the primary objective in this paper, was to investigate the extent to which heart failure or evidence of major cardiac dysfunction influenced outcome in previous trials of beta-blockers in heart failure after myocardial infarction.; We assessed the extent to which the inclusion of patients with heart failure or major cardiac dysfunction influenced outcome in randomised trials of long-term use of beta-blockade after myocardial infarction. The primary analysis was to assess the extent to which the proportion of patients included in each trial with heart failure influenced the relative odds of all-cause mortality in the trials. All randomised trials without crossover with treatment lasting more than one month and with 50 or more patients were considered. All those that provided information on the proportion of patients with heart failure or major cardiac dysfunction in the original or subsequent articles were included in the analysis.; Overall treatment with a beta-blocker was associated with a 22.6% reduction in the odds of death (95% C1 11-32.3%). There were very few data on the effects of beta-blockers after myocardial infarction in patients with documented left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In the analysis that included heart failure as a factor, treatment with a beta-blocker was associated with a non-significant interaction with the presence of heart failure. However, because the group including heart failure patients were at higher risk, the absolute benefit of treatment with beta-blockers appeared greater in this group.; This analysis suggests that the relative benefit of beta-blockers on mortality after a myocardial infarction is similar in the presence or absence of heart failure but that the absolute benefit may be greater in the former. However, as current clinical practice has changed radically from the time when the majority of these trials were conducted, further trial evidence would be desirable.",5,E

Serum lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentration increased (P<0.05 vs. placebo). Mean low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle diameter was marginally increased by active treatment as compared with placebo (P =0.08). No changes were observed in the serum concentrations of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and apolipoprotein E (apoE). In conclusion, 9 months of GH treatment in abdominally obese men beneficially reduced serum concentrations of TC, LDL-C and apoB, and marginally increased mean LDL diameter, while serum Lp(a) increased. The ultimate effect of GH therapy on the cardiovascular risk remains, however, to be determined.",E,E

Assignment to propafenone was discontinued in March 1992, after an interim analysis conducted in 58 patients showed a 61% higher all-cause mortality rate than in 61 ICD patients during a follow-up of 11.3 months. The study continued to recruit 288 patients in the remaining 3 study groups; of these, 99 were assigned to ICDs, 92 to amiodarone, and 97 to metoprolol. The primary end point was all-cause mortality. The study was terminated in March 1998, when all patients had concluded a minimum 2-year follow-up. Over a mean follow-up of 57+/-34 months, the crude death rates were 36.4% (95% CI 26.9% to 46.6%) in the ICD and 44.4% (95% CI 37.2% to 51.8%) in the amiodarone/metoprolol arm.

This study examines whether these risk factors predict CHD among older Japanese-American men. With use of the Honolulu Heart Program Lipoprotein Exam 3 (1980 to 1982) as baseline, and 12-year follow-up for CHD events, a nested, case-control study was designed. One hundred forty-five incident CHD cases were identified and matched to 2 controls each. LDL particle diameter (size) was determined by gradient gel electrophoresis. A 10-angstrom (A) decrease in LDL size at baseline was associated with increased risk of incident CHD (relative risk 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.63). After adjustment for baseline risk factors, the LDL size association was no longer statistically significant (relative risk 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.49). When principal components analysis was used to define a composite variable for LDL size, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol, this component predicted CHD independent of smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, and beta-blocker use (p <0.01). Therefore, this prospective analysis of data from older, Japanese-American men demonstrated that decreased LDL size is a univariate predictor of incident CHD, and that a composite risk factor of LDL size, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol was a risk factor for CHD independent of other risk factors.",E,E

Baseline blood pressure was 174.4/97.8 mm Hg (mean), age 66.9 years, body mass index 28.0 kg/m2; 54.1% were women and 12.5% had diabetes mellitus. This population will be treated until at least 1,040 have a primary endpoint.

The mandatory titration level of < or = 160/95 mm Hg was reached by 72.1% of the patients. At the 12-month visit, 22.7% of all patients were taking blinded study drug alone, 44.3% were taking blinded drug plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and 17.7% were taking blinded drugs plus HCTZ and additional drugs. Controlling for all other variables, patients in the US received more medication and had 2.4 times the odds of achieving blood pressure control than patients in the rest of the study (P < .001). Previously untreated patients (n = 2,530) had a larger initial decrease in blood pressure compared with those previously treated. Diabetics (n = 1,148) needed more medication than nondiabetics to gain blood pressure control. Only 13.9% of the patients had discontinued blinded study drug and 1.4% missed the revisit at 12 months. These data demonstrate both the successful lowering of blood pressure during 12 months of follow-up in a large cohort of patients with hypertension and LVH on ECG, but also emphasize the need for two or more drugs to control high blood pressure in most of these patients. Being previously treated and having diabetes were associated with less blood pressure response, whereas living in the US indicated better blood pressure control. It has been possible to keep most of these patients with complicated hypertension taking blinded study drug for 12 months.",I,E

Characteristics of diabetic vs. non-diabetic subjects: number (97 vs. 211), men (70.1 vs. 70.14%) mean age (59.76 vs. 58.01), height (1.71 vs. 1.71 m), body weight (85.91 vs. 81.40 kg), BMI (29.36 vs. 27.68 g/m2), total cholesterol (5.73 vs. 5.51 mmol/l,) triacylglycerols (2.63 vs. 2.08 mmol/l), fasting blood sugar level (7.31 vs. 4.88 mmol/l), hypertension (24.74 vs. 37.44%), hyperuricaemia (40.21 vs. 27.01%), IHD (93.81 vs. 93.84%), ischaemia of the lower extremities (6.19 vs. 13.74%), cerebrovascular episodes (7.22 vs. 5.21%), smokers 10.31 vs. 5.21%), ex-smokers (47.42 vs. 57.82%), non-smokers (42.27 vs. 36.97%). The diabetic patients were treated in 31.96% with PAD, in 5.15% with insulin and in 62.89% by diet only.; BE was used to assess and set the load tolerance, i.e. with regard to the current medication. The conclusion of BE is from the aspect of IHD either positive (ECG signs of coronary insufficiency), negative (without signs of coronary insufficiency at the level of 85% aerobic capacity according to Astrand) or impossible to evaluate (without signs of coronary insufficiency, while not attaining this level of load). Positive ergometric examinations were divided into symptomatic ones (i.e. with stenocardias during BE) and asymptomatic (silent ischaemia). In diabetic vs. non-diabetic subjects there were 0% vs. 6.16% symptomatically positive BE, 27.84% vs. 11.37% positive BE with silent ischaemia, 17.53% vs. 20.85% negative BE and 54.64% vs. 61.61% BE which could not be evaluated. The watt training tolerance was 51.55 vs. 57.26 W.; In diabetics (31.49% of the group) there was a significantly higher body weight, BMI, TG. As to risk factors of IHD and manifestations of atherosclerosis there were among diabetics more patients with a history of a cerebrovascular episode, more smokers and conversely fewer hypertonic subjects and fewer with ischaemia of the lower extremities than in non-diabetic subjects. During BE in diabetics there were more silent ischaemias than in non-diabetics. None of the diabetics with a positive BE suffered from symptomatic ischaemia. The high percentage of BE which cannot be evaluated in both groups is due to the concurrent administration of drugs, in particular beta-blockers and the protocol of the examination (an increasing loading test after 4 min. 谩 25 W) which is suitable for setting the training load and not for assessment of coronary insufficiency (for this purpose the protocol after 2 min. 谩 50 W is more suitable).

However, its value as a predictor of VA recurrence and hospitalisation after ICD implantation is unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether infarct size as determined by perfusion imaging can help to identify patients who are at high risk for recurrence of VA and hospitalisation after ICD implantation. We studied 56 patients with CAD and life-threatening VA. Before ICD implantation, all patients underwent a uniform study protocol including a thallium-201 stress-redistribution perfusion study. A defect score as a measurement of infarct size was calculated using a 17-segment 5-point scoring system. Study endpoints during follow-up were documented episodes of appropriate anti-tachycardia pacing and/or shocks for VA and cardiac hospitalisation for electrical storm (defined as three or more appropriate ICD interventions within 24 h), heart failure or angina. After a mean follow-up of 470+/-308 days, 22 patients (39%) had recurrences of VA. In univariate analysis, predictors for recurrence were: (a) ventricular tachycardia (VT) as the initial presenting arrhythmia (86% vs 59% for patients without ICD therapy, P=0.04), (b) treatment with beta-blockers (36% vs 68%, P=0.03) and (c) a defect score (DS) > or = 20 (64% vs 32%, P=0.03). In multivariate analysis, VT as the presenting arrhythmia (chi2=5.51, P=0.02) and a DS > or = 20 (chi2=4.22, P=0.04) remained independent predictors. Cardiac hospitalisation was more frequent in patients with a DS > or = 20 (44% vs 13% for patients with DS < 20, P=0.015) and this was particularly due to more frequent hospitalisations for electrical storm (24% vs 3% for patients with DS < 20, P=0.037). The extent of scarring determined by perfusion imaging can separate patients with CAD into high- and low-risk groups for recurrence of VA and cardiac hospitalisation after ICD implantation.",E,E

The risk factors for the first episode of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients are the severity of liver dysfunction, a large size of the varices and the presence of endoscopic red colour signs, but only a third of patients who suffer variceal haemorrhage demonstrate the above risk factors. The only treatment that does not require sophisticated equipment or the skills of a specialist, and is immediately available, is vasoactive drug therapy. Hence, drug therapy should be considered to be the initial treatment of choice and can be administered while the patient is transferred to hospital, as has been done in one recent study. Moreover, drug therapy is no longer considered to be only a 'stop-gap' therapy until definitive endoscopic therapy is performed. Several recent trials have reported an efficacy similar to that of emergency sclerotherapy in the control of variceal bleeding. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that those patients with high variceal or portal pressure are likely to continue to bleed or re-bleed early, implying that prolonged therapy lowering the portal pressure over several days may be the optimal treatment. Pharmacological treatment with beta-blockers is safe, effective and the standard long-term treatment for the prevention of recurrence of variceal bleeding. The combination of beta-blockers with isosorbide-5-mononitrate needs further testing in randomized controlled trials. The use of haemodynamic targets for the reduction of the HVPG response needs further study, and surrogate markers of the pressure response need evaluation. Ligation has recently been compared with beta-blockers for primary prophylaxis, but there is as yet no good evidence to recommend banding for primary prophylaxis if beta-blockers can be given.",E,E

The present study investigated the effect of celiprolol, atenolol, and placebo on acetylcholine-induced vasomotion in patients with coronary artery disease. Furthermore, direct effects on coronary vasomotion and on hemodynamics were evaluated. Acetylcholine (intracoronary concentrations of 6.3x10(-7), 2.0x10(-6), and 6.3x10(-6) M) was given before and after double-blind celiprolol (0.30 mg/kg IV), atenolol (0.15 mg/kg IV), or placebo in 3x12 patients. Vasomotion was investigated by quantitative coronary angiography in proximal and distal segments of epicardial coronary arteries, and by the determination of the coronary resistance index based on Doppler-flow measurements. The investigated drugs had no direct affect on the diameter of the epicardial coronary arteries. However, celiprolol, in contrast to atenolol, significantly reduced systemic vascular resistance (change after atenolol: from 1,855+/-308 to 2,161+/-550 dyne s cm(-5); celiprolol: 1,691+/-435 to 1,411+/-343 dyne s cm(-5); and placebo: 1,722+/-215 to 1,710+/-213 dyne s cm(-5), p<0.001) and the coronary resistance index (change after atenolol: 2.52+/-3.58 to 2.86+/-4.24; celiprolol: 2.70+/-1.55 to 2.49+/-2.26; and placebo: 1.97+/-1.35 to 1.92+/-1.25, p<0.01).

Because abnormalities of endothelial regulation of vascular function may contribute to the occurrence of coronary events, we tested the hypothesis that elevated CRP levels are associated with an abnormal systemic endothelial vascular reactivity.; Endothelium-dependent (10 to 50 microg/min acetylcholine) and endothelium-independent (2 to 8 microg/min sodium nitroprusside) forearm blood flow responses were measured with venous occlusion plethysmography in 60 male patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease. Forearm blood flow responses to acetylcholine were inversely correlated with CRP serum levels (r=-0.46, P:=0.001). With multivariate analysis that included the classic risk factors for coronary artery disease, elevated CRP serum level remained a statistically significant independent predictor of a blunted endothelial vasodilator capacity. Most important, normalization of elevated CRP levels over time was associated with a normalization of endothelium-mediated forearm blood flow responses after 3 months.; Thus, elevated CRP serum levels indicative of a systemic inflammatory response are associated with a blunted systemic endothelial vasodilator function. The identification of elevated CRP levels as a transient independent risk factor for endothelial dysfunction might provide an important clue to link a systemic marker of inflammation to atherosclerotic disease progression.",E,E

Of the approximately 1.4 million people enrolled in these managed care plans during the study period (January through December 1994), a total of 2777 patients (mean age, 56.9 years) met the study criteria, which included diagnostic codes for CHF and claims eligibility of at least 1 year. We reviewed the charges incurred by patients diagnosed with CHF for the 6 months after the initial CHF medical claim. We also examined the treatment received by each of these patients.; During the study period, 378 of the 2777 patients with CHF (14%) were admitted to the hospital at a cost of almost $3 million (an average of $7863 per hospitalized patient). Seventy-eight percent of the study population received prescription drugs, at an average per-patient cost of $942. The most commonly prescribed drug class was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, prescribed for 38% of patients. Calcium channel blockers were prescribed for 33% of patients, but beta-blockers were prescribed for only 18% of patients. Hospitalization accounted for 54% of the total cost for CHF treatment, with prescription drugs accounting for 38%.; Congestive heart failure represents a significant financial burden within a non-elderly managed care population. Improved management of the condition is needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality, as well as the costs of treatment, associated with CHF. Considerable data indicate that drugs such as beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can significantly decrease the morbidity and mortality of CHF. Further investigation is needed into whether increased use of prescription pharmaceuticals may reduce hospitalization rates and overall costs for CHF in this setting.",E,E

It is not known whether chronotropic incompetence predicts all-cause mortality independent of angiographic severity of coronary artery disease (CAD). Study subjects included consecutive patients who underwent first-time, symptom-limited exercise treadmill testing and coronary angiography within 90 days; no patient was taking beta blockers or had a history of heart failure, valve disease, or prior revascularization. Chronotropic response was measured in 2 ways: (1) failure to reach 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate, and (2) a low chronotropic index, a measure of exercise heart rate response that accounts for effects of age, physical fitness, and resting heart rate. Angiographic severity of CAD was assessed using the Duke Prognostic Weight Score, with a score > or = 42 considered to be indicative of severe CAD. Among 384 eligible patients, failure to reach 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate occurred in 61 (16%) and a low chronotropic index was noted in 133 (35%). Severe CAD was present in 63 (16%). During 6 years of follow-up there were 56 deaths. Mortality was predicted by failure to reach target heart rate (RR 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 3.39, chi-square = 4, p = 0.05), by severe CAD (RR 2.21, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.95, chi-square = 8, p = 0.007), and, most strongly, by a low chronotropic index (RR 2.72, 95% CI 1.60 to 4.61, chi-square = 15, p = 0.0002). In a multivariable model, low chronotropic index remained predictive of death (adjusted RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.82, p = 0.004), whereas severe CAD no longer predicted death (adjusted RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.31, p > 0.4).

In a subset of patients with essential hypertension, sympathetic activation may contribute to the development and maintenance of hypertension. Unlike the first generation of centrally active antihypertensive drugs, the second generation may be superior because of its selectivity to I1-imidazoline receptor and selective binding to the vasomotor center. Lack of a2 effects differentiates moxonidine from clonidine with respect to monoxidine""s superior side-effect profile (little or no sedation or dry mouth). Clinical trials show that moxonidine is as effective as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (eg, enalapril and captopril), b-blockers (e.g., atenolol), calcium-channel blockers (e.g., long-acting nifedipine), and diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide) in lowering blood pressure and that it has superior tolerability. Thus, central modulation of the sympathetic nervous system has re-emerged as an exciting target for blood pressure reduction.

The most effective drugs were beta-blockers and antidepressants. In a single-blind study we estimated comparative efficiency of amitriptiline (inhibitor of noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake and 5-HT2-receptor antagonist) 12.5-25 mg/daily, fluoxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) 10-20 mg/daily, and maprotiline (a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) 10-25 mg/daily. The duration of the therapy of migraine between the attacks was 12 weeks. Each group included 20 patients. 46 patients completed the whole course of therapy: 14 patients received amitriptyline, 16 patients--fluoxetine, and 16 patients--maprotiline. Positive results of the treatment (a reduction of the frequency of the migraine attacks during a treatment by 50% as compared with the baseline period) were observed in 71% of the patients treated with amitriptyline, in 56% of the patients treated with fluoxetine, and in 38% of the patients treated with maprotiline. All the drugs were able to reduce both intensity and duration of a headache. Index of the Quality of Life in the patients with migraine was increased in the groups treated with either amitriptyline or fluoxetine, but not in a group treated with maprotiline. The results obtained agree with the notion about high efficiency of antidepressants given between migraine attacks. Amitriptyline and fluoxetine were more efficient in preventive therapy than maprotiline. These findings suggested indirectly, that the efficiency of antidepressants in treatment of migraine is explained by inhibition of serotonin reuptake and by 5-HT2-receptor antagonism, while influence on the inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake was not so significant.",1,E

Clinical and echocardiographic evaluation was performed in 20 Japanese women in a follow-up period of 7.0 +/- 2.0 years. The patients were divided into 2 groups: Group A (n=10) patients who did not receive beta-blockers, and Group B (n=10) patients treated with long-term (5.1 +/- 1.6 years) therapeutic doses of beta-blockers. Left ventricular wall thickness increased significantly in all Takayasu patients who did not receive beta-blockers. Consequently, a remarkable increment in left ventricular mass took place (232 +/- 59 to 361 +/- 79 g; p < 0.005). In the same group, progressive worsening of the symptoms, with no reduction in the percent fractional shortening, was observed in 2 patients, while reduction of this last index was present in 1 asymptomatic patient. On the other hand, among the patients who were treated with beta-blockers, left ventricular mass still increased in 6 cases, while it clearly decreased in the other 4 cases (290 +/- 171 to 284 +/- 61 g; NS). The increment in wall thickness or left ventricular mass observed among patients with beta-blocker therapy was clearly less than the one registered among those who had not received beta-blockers. Furthermore, no worsening of the symptoms and/or left ventricular performance was observed during the follow-up period for patients receiving beta-blockers. We conclude that beta-blocker therapy can slow and even reverse the progression of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with Takayasu arteritis complicated by moderate or severe aortic regurgitation. The mechanism still needs to be elucidated. We believe an effective reduction in the excessive afterload imposed on the left ventricle to be most likely responsible, but cardiac beta-receptor up-regulation might also be involved. Deterioration of the clinical status and/or impairment of left ventricular function were not associated with beta-blocker therapy in our patients. Therefore, these agents can be used safely alone or in addition to standard anti-hypertensive therapy when attempting to reduce excessive afterload, in spite of the presence of severe aortic regurgitation.",E,E

However, the optimal timing for cardiac transplantation and predictors of mortality in patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy (ESCM) has been poorly defined. The primary purpose of this study focused on the natural history of ambulatory patients with ESCM for HT assessment. Secondly, we tried to determine prognostic factors of individuals with the poorest short-term outcome and the optimal timing for HT in patients with ESCM. Finally, clinical treatment with angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), carvedilol and amiodarone in the prevention of mortality caused by ESCM, were retrospectively evaluated. The short-term outcomes of 119 referral patients with ESCM for four years were observed. The patients had New York Heart Association class III to IV dyspnea at initial assessment for HT. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 17 +/- 6% and cardiac index (CI) was 2.0 +/- 0.6l/min/m2. After optimization of medical treatment, the patients were divided into two major groups according to CI equal to or less than 2.0l/min/m2 and more than 2.0l/min/m2. HTs were accepted in 88 patients and the patients were divided into two groups: medical treatment (group 1, 56 patients) or HT (group 3, 32 patients); HT was not accepted in the other 31 patients (group 2). We studied the probability of the survival curve and prognostic variables of the groups with medical treatment in the follow-up of 12 +/- 9 months. During follow-up, 49 patients were alive without HT. The remaining 38 patients died; 27 patients were in group 1 and 11 patients were in group 2. Eight deaths in group 2 were sudden. The actuarial survival rate among the non-HT population was 73%, 68%, 63 %, and 56 % at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively. The actuarial survival rate among group 1 was 70 %, 59 %, 55 %, and 52 % at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively. The actuarial survival rate among group 2 was 87 %, 85 %, 77 %, and 65 % at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively. A comparison, excluding patients with HT, was performed with those who had survived < 1 year and > or 1 year after assessment, and those who had died. Two parameters were independent predictors of prognosis on univariate and multivariate analysis: total pulmonary vascular resistance (TPR) > or = 14 Wood units (W) and CI < 1.65 l/min/m2 at 6 and 12 months after assessment. Treatment with amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia (VT) showed no convincing role in the prevention of sudden death in our patients. Also, treatment with ACEIs or carvedilol for heart failure was unconvincing to improve the short-term outcome in this study. Our results suggest in properly selected patients that HT should be considered within six months among patients with severe heart failure. Hemodynamic parameters associated with right cardiac function are important determinants of mortality caused by progressive heart failure. Predictors such as CI and TPR may be considered as important markers of mortality in prediction of short-term outcome in patients with ESCM, as other predictors reported in the literature.",E,E

Safety and efficacy are, however, ultimately linked to each other; therefore both must be evaluated especially in the therapy of angina and hypertension, the main clinical indications for CCBs. The structural, functional, and pharmacokinetic heterogeneity of CCBs means that the efficacy and dangers of one subclass, such as the short-acting dihydropyridines (DHPs), in one situation, such as unstable angina, do not necessarily apply in other clinical situations. One hundred studies are reviewed according to their methods of data collection: case series, case control, cohort, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and meta-analyses. Large, well-designed RCTs and the meta-analyses based on these trials remain the gold standard. Observational studies, though potentially less reliable sources of information because of selection bias, may nevertheless produce hypotheses that must then be tested in RCTs. Regarding safety, both observational studies and RCTs suggest that adverse effects of CCBs may be linked to short-acting agents, specifically short-acting nifedipine. Two good studies favor the safety of verapamil, even in short-acting form. Incomplete but increasing overall evidence favors the safety of longer-acting DHPs. Heart failure remains a class contraindication to the use of all CCBs, with some exceptions. Regarding efficacy, there are positive results of RCTs with CCBs in 2 specific clinical situations, namely, verapamil in postinfarct protection in the absence of pre-existing heart failure, and 2 outcome studies on hypertension with longer acting DHPs. These results cannot automatically be applied to other clinical situations and to other CCBs. For example, there is no evidence for the safety or efficacy of DHPs used without beta blockers in postinfarct patients. In diabetic hypertensives, 2 relatively large RCTs show that the blood pressure can be reduced by DHP-based therapy in diabetics, with a reduction in hard end points. To achieve current blood pressure goals, combination therapy is almost always necessary, and in diabetics there is strong evidence that 1 essential component should be an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The future aim with CCBs must be to obtain a large database gathered from RCTs, which will give the same certainty about efficacy and safety that already holds for use of the diuretics in hypertension, beta-blockers in postmyocardial infarction patients, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure.",E,E

After a standardized selection protocol based on sharply defined drug-resistant hypertension or renal function impairment during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, patients underwent renal scintigraphy and a captopril-renin challenge test. A set of clinical characteristics was also recorded. Sensitivity and specificity of renal scintigraphy for diagnosing renal artery stenosis were 0.72 and 0.90 and of the captopril-renin test 0.77 to 0.91 and 0.69 to 0.75 depending on the criterion used. The clinical characteristics were used to construct a clinical prediction rule for renal artery stenosis, which had a sensitivity of 0.68 and a specificity of 0.87 at a cut-off level of 30% predicted probability. However, with the prediction rule a sensitivity of 0.90 could be reached by performing arteriography only in patients with a predicted probability of stenosis of > or =10%, resulting in a considerable reduction of the number of arteriograms to be made. A diagnostic strategy is advocated starting with drug-resistant hypertension and continuing to renal arteriography only in patients with increased probability of stenosis. Patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis were then randomized to balloon angioplasty (n = 56) versus antihypertensive medication (n = 50). Three months after randomization 22 patients from the medication group underwent balloon angioplasty in second instance. In an intention-to-treat analysis, no difference in blood pressure was found between the groups after 3 months, nor after 12 months of follow-up, although there was a small medication-sparing effect of balloon angioplasty. The lack of a beneficial effect of balloon angioplasty compared with medication could not be attributed to the high stenosis recurrence rate after angioplasty, nor to the fact that the inclusion criterion was set at a stenosis level of > or =50% so that patients with relatively mild stenosis were also included. Renal function after angioplasty was slightly better in the angioplasty group than in the medication group, and improvement of the renal scintigram occurred more often after angioplasty. Apart from the treatment of patients with specific characteristics, the presented therapeutic approach starts with extending the antihypertensive drug therapy to control blood pressure. Only if blood pressure cannot be controlled or if renal function deteriorates, balloon angioplasty (with stent placement) is indicated.",E,E

Also the number hospitalization frequency decreases. Initially, the beneficial effects of beta-blockers on symptoms are only minor or absent. During the initiation period some clinical deterioration may occur which has to be treated accordingly; these patients are, however, difficult to identify. Initiation has to be done using low doses and should be restricted to stabilized, optimally treated patients. Doses should only be increased every 2 to 4 weeks until target doses are reached.

One of its key causes is neuroendocrine activation via the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Neuroendocrine blockers of the sympathetic nervous system (beta-blockers) and of the RAS (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 [AT1] receptor blockers) therefore have an important potential therapeutic role in heart failure. The promising results from clinical trials with beta-blockers suggest that these drugs will become an established part of the future management of patients with mild to moderate symptomatic heart failure. Blockade of the RAS with ACE inhibitors has also been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. Blockade of the AT1-receptor, with agents such as candesartan, produces more specific and, theoretically, more complete blockade of the major negative cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II than is possible using ACE inhibitors, whilst maintaining placebo-like tolerability. Furthermore, AT1-receptor blockade leads to increased stimulation of the angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor, which, according to experimental data, may have favourable cardiovascular effects. Following encouraging results from two pilot studies, a major new international study programme - CHARM (Candesartan in Heart failure - Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity) - has been initiated to define the clinical benefits of candesartan cilexetil in a wide variety of patients with symptomatic heart failure. CHARM is the first study to accept all relevant heart failure patients who may benefit from RAS blockade, irrespective of their left ventricular function or tolerance of ACE inhibitors. The 6500 patients to be recruited will be divided among three integrated outcome studies. Two of these studies will examine the effect of candesartan cilexetil versus placebo in patients with an ejection fraction of 40% or less who are tolerant or intolerant of ACE inhibitors.

CHF is characterized by profound abnormalities in cardiac autonomic control that contribute to progressive circulatory failure and influence survival.; Time- and frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) indexes were obtained from 24-hour Holter recordings and compared to assess the role of gender in 131 men and 68 women with CHF (mean age 60 +/- 13.6 years, range 21 to 87; New York Heart Association Functional Class III [66%] and IV [34%]). Gender-related differences in HRV were observed only in the subset of patients with nonischemic heart failure (55 men and 39 women). Among the time-domain indexes, the SD of the RR intervals (76 +/- 5.3 msec vs 55.3 +/- 3.2 msec, P < 0.0001) and indexes denoting parasympathetic modulation, the percentage of RR intervals with >50 msec variation (4.0% +/- 1.0% vs 6.5% +/- 1.3%, P = 0.02), and the square root of mean squared differences of successive RR intervals (19.1 +/- 3.3 vs 28.4 +/- 3.8, P = 0.004) were higher in women. Among the frequency-domain indexes, the total power (7.5 +/- 0.13 ln-msec2 vs 8.3 +/- 0.14 ln-msec2, P = 0.0002), the ultralow-frequency power (7.2 +/- 0.11 ln-msec2 vs 8.0 +/- 0.14 In-msec2, P < 0.0001), the low-frequency power (3.8 +/- 0.25 ln-msec2 vs 4.8 +/- 0.28 ln-msec2, P = 0.006), and the high-frequency power (3.8 +/- 0.24 ln-msec2, vs 4.6 +/- 0.26 ln-msec2, P = 0.003) were greater in women than in men.; Women with nonischemic CHF have an attenuated sympathetic activation and parasympathetic withdrawal compared with men.

Early studies demonstrated that beta-blocker therapy improved left ventricular function, reduced neurohumoral activity and reduced heart failure symptoms in these patients. While none of these small studies demonstrated a significant benefit in terms of overall survival, several meta-analyses suggested that beta-blocker therapy could, in fact, reduce mortality in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and mild to moderate heart failure symptoms (New York Heart Association class II or III). Three large, recently completed, trials have confirmed the benefit of beta-blockade in these patients. This report reviews some of the initial clinical studies of beta-blockade in heart failure, examines the findings of the three large multicentre trials and other relevant research. Finally, ongoing trials designed to assess the relative efficacy of different beta-blockers and evaluate the utility of beta-blockade in specific subsets of patients with heart failure are discussed.",5,E

Because only half the patients respond to a single drug, even at full dosage, a second hypotensive agent is frequently required to obtain adequate blood pressure control. The combination of a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist and a beta-blocker can be justified by their different mechanisms of action. A randomised double blind parallel group study versus placebo was performed, in order to assess the efficacy of atenolol combined with amlodipine in the treatment of stage I-II essential hypertension not controlled by atenolol alone. Twenty-four-hour arterial blood pressure monitoring showed that amlodipine added to atenolol produced a statistically significant reduction of blood pressure values compared with placebo in patients whose blood pressure was not controlled by atenolol alone. Blood pressure circadian rhythm was unchanged. The reduction of side-effects, obtained by adding a dihydropyridine derivate to a beta-blocker, confirms the effectiveness of this combination.",E,E

Patients with open-angle glaucoma were required to have IOP at least 22 mmHg and patients with ocular hypertension were required to have IOP at least 27 mmHg, on treatment with one or two ocular hypotensive drugs of which at least one had to be a beta-blocker. All patients were treated with timolol, 5 mg/ml twice daily, for a 2-4 week run-in period. They were then randomised to latanoprost, 50 microg/ml once daily, or timolol 5 mg/ml plus dorzolamide, 20 mg/ml twice daily. The difference in mean diurnal IOP change from baseline to month 3 was compared in the two groups.; When patients were switched to latanoprost, mean diurnal IOP was reduced by 5.2 mmHg (23%) compared to 4.0 mmHg (17%) in the group in which dorzolamide was added to timolol. The difference of 1.2 mmHg was statistically significant (p = 0.005). The majority of adverse events during both treatments were judged as mild.; The results suggest that a switch to latanoprost monotherapy is an alternative to combined treatment with timolol and dorzolamide in patients inadequately controlled on a topical adrenergic beta-receptor antagonist alone.",5,E

The aim of this study was to assess sex differences in medical and invasive coronary procedures (angiography, PTCA, and CABG) in AMI patients admitted to cardiac care units (CCUs) in Israel in the mid 1990s and their association with early and 1-year prognosis.; We studied 2867 consecutive AMI patients (2125 men, 74%) hospitalized in all 25 CCUs in Israel from 3 prospective nationwide surveys conducted in 1992, 1994, and 1996. Women were, on average, older than men (69 versus 61 years, P:<0.0001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, Killip class >/=II on admission, and in-hospital complications. Women received aspirin and beta-blockers less often than did men, but these differences were not significant after age adjustment. The unadjusted rates of thrombolysis, angiography, and PTCA/CABG use were lower in women than in men but not after covariate adjustment: 42% versus 48% (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.11), 23% versus 31% (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.09), and 15% versus 19% (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.19), respectively.

The difference in 30-day outcome was not influenced by the use of different therapeutic modalities, including thrombolysis and invasive coronary procedures, but was rather due to the older age and greater comorbidity of women; these findings seem also to explain the less frequent use of invasive procedures in women.",E,E

Although beta-blockade therapy is supposed to decrease myocardial adrenergic activity, data on restoration of autonomic balance to the heart and, particularly, on vagal reflexes are limited.; Nineteen consecutive patients with moderate, stable CHF (age 54 +/- 7 years, New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II to III, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 24 +/- 6%), treated with optimized conventional medical therapy, received carvedilol treatment. Controls with CHF were selected from our database on the basis of the following matching criteria: age +/- 3 years, same NYHA class, LVEF +/- 3%, pulmonary wedge pressure +/- 3 mm Hg, peak volume of oxygen +/- 3 ml/kg/min, same therapy. All patients underwent analysis of baroreflex sensitivity (phenylephrine method) and of HRV (24-h Holter recording) at baseline and after six months.; Beta-blockade therapy was associated with a significant improvement in symptoms (NYHA class 2.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.5, p < 0.01), systolic and diastolic function (LVEF 23 +/- 7 vs. 28 +/- 9%, p < 0.01; pulmonary wedge pressure 17 +/- 8 vs. 14 +/- 7 mm Hg, p < 0.05) and mitral regurgitation area (7.0 +/- 5.1 vs. 3.6 +/- 3.0 cm2, p < 0.01).

During a mean follow-up of 19 +/- 8 months a reduced number of cardiac events (death plus heart transplantation, 58% vs. 31%) occurred in those patients receiving beta-blockade.; Besides the well-known effects on ventricular function, treatment with carvedilol in CHF restores both autonomic balance and the ability to increase reflex vagal activity. This protective mechanism may contribute to the beneficial effect of beta-blockade treatment on prognosis in CHF.",E,E

In contrast, patients with ECG LVH by Sokolow-Lyon criteria were slightly younger; less obese; more likely to be male, black, and current smokers; less likely to have diabetes; more likely to have angina and a history of cerebrovascular disease; and had higher systolic and pulse blood pressure but slightly lower diastolic blood pressure than patients without ECG LVH by this method. By use of multivariate logistic regression analyses, presence of ECG LVH by Cornell voltage-duration product criteria was predominantly associated with higher body mass index, increased age, and female gender, whereas presence of ECG LVH by Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria was predominantly related to lower body mass index, male gender, and black race. Thus, hypertensive patients who meet Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria are associated with different, but potentially equally adverse, risk factor profiles.",E,E

The Women's Health Initiative, a 40-center national study of risk factors and prevention of heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, provides a unique opportunity to examine these issues in the largest, multiethnic, best-characterized such cohort. Baseline data from the initial 98 705 women, aged 50 to 79 years, enrolled were analyzed to relate prevalence, treatment, and control of hypertension to demographic, clinical, and risk-factor covariates, and logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios after adjusting for multiple potential confounders. Overall, 37.8% of the women had hypertension, which is defined as systolic blood pressure >/=140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure >/=90 mm Hg or being on medication for high blood pressure; 64.3% were treated with drugs, and blood pressure was controlled in only 36.1% of the hypertensive women, with lower rates of control in the oldest group. After adjustment for multiple covariates, current hormone users had higher prevalence than did nonusers (odds ratio 1.25). Hypertensive women had more comorbid conditions than did nonhypertensive women, and women with comorbidities were more likely to be treated pharmacologically. Diuretics were used by 44.3% of hypertensives either as monotherapy or in combination with other drug classes. As monotherapy, calcium channel blockers were used in 16%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in 14%, beta-blockers in 9%, and diuretics in 14% of the hypertensive women. Diuretics as monotherapy were associated with better blood pressure control than any of the other drug classes as monotherapy.

Therapeutic implications.,Acromegaly; Heart Failure; Human Growth Hormone; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,"Volterrani, M; Manelli, F; Cicoira, M; Lorusso, R; Giustina, A","Congestive heart failure is a multiple aetiology, high prevalence, poor prognosis cardiovascular disorder. Medical treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy is aimed at alleviating the symptoms of heart failure. Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and very recently, beta-blockers have been shown to have favourable effects on symptoms, exercise capacity and mortality. Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 are involved in several physiological processes such as the control of muscle mass and function, body composition and regulation of nutrient metabolism. The roles of GH and IGF-1 as modulators of myocardial structure and function are well established. Receptors for both GH and IGF-1 are expressed by cardiac myocytes; therefore, GH may act directly on the heart or via the induction of local or systemic IGF-1, whereas IGF-1 may act by endocrine, paracrine or autocrine mechanisms. Patients with acromegaly have an increased propensity to develop ventricular hypertrophy and cardiovascular diseases and, in addition, an impaired cardiac efficiency is observed in patients with GH deficiency. Animal models of pressure and volume overload have demonstrated up-regulation of cardiac IGF-1 production and expression of GH and IGF-1 receptors, implying that the local regulation of these factors is influenced by haemodynamic changes. Moreover, experimental studies suggest that GH and IGF-1 have stimulatory effects on myocardial contractility, possibly mediated by changes in intracellular calcium handling. Heart failure is caused by ventricular dilatation with abnormal wall thickening, which leads to impaired cardiac performance; therefore, based on the evidence available for GH we would expect beneficial effects from the use of GH in these patients. Several papers highlight the positive influence of GH in the regulation of heart development and performance. In patients with GH deficiency, GH administration dramatically improves cardiac function. In small nonblind studies, both short and long term GH treatment have demonstrated beneficial effects in patients with heart failure secondary to ischaemic or idiophatic cardiomyopathy. Recently, two randomised, placebo-controlled studies, did not show significant GH-mediated improvement in cardiac performance in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, despite significant increases in IGF-1. Acquired GH resistance, might be an important feature of severe heart failure and explain the different responses to GH therapy seen in different patients. Whether GH treatment will finally find a place, and with which modalities, in the treatment of heart failure remains to be established.",E,E

By virtue of this dual mechanism of action, the drug acts as a balanced coronary and peripheral vasodilator and reduces both preload and afterload. The K+ ATP channel has been shown to be involved in the phenomenon of myocardial preconditioning, and studies in animal models of ischaemia-reperfusion-induced myocardial stunning or infarction indicate that nicorandil has cardio-protective effects. Studies in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) have shown that the administration of nicorandil reduces ST-segment elevation during ischaemia. Nicorandil significantly improved the results of exercise tolerance tests versus baseline in patients with stable effort angina pectoris in early noncomparative trials. The drug also improved the results of exercise tolerance tests relative to placebo in early randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In randomised, double-blind comparative studies in patients with angina pectoris, nicorandil has demonstrated equivalent efficacy, as measured by exercise tolerance testing, to isosorbide di- and mononitrate, metoprolol, propranolol, atenolol, diltiazem, amlodipine and nifedipine. The effects of nicorandil on various aspects of myocardial recovery from ischaemic damage caused by acute myocardial infarction have been investigated in the short term. Regional left ventricular (LV) wall motion, a marker of myocardial function, was significantly improved in nicorandil recipients relative to control. The main adverse event associated with nicorandil as treatment for angina pectoris is headache. This can be minimised by commencing nicorandil at a low dose in patients prone to headache. There have been infrequent case reports of mouth ulcers in patients receiving nicorandil; causality has not been conclusively established, but product prescribing information indicates that an alternative treatment should be considered if persistent aphthous or severe mouth ulceration occurs. Thus, nicorandil remains a useful background therapy for patients with angina pectoris. The drug has also demonstrated potential cardioprotective effects when used as part of an intervention strategy directly after acute myocardial infarction in high-risk patients. Further large scale longer term studies of nicorandil in this latter indication are awaited with interest.",E,E

The committee also recommended beta-blockers in hypertensive patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Our objective was to determine whether prescribing practices for older hypertensive patients are consistent with evidence-based guidelines.; We examined prescription patterns from January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1995 for 23,748 patients 65 years or older with a new diagnosis of hypertension from the New Jersey Medicaid program and that state's Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled program (PAAD). We linked drug use data with information on demographic variables and comorbid medical conditions.; During the study period, calcium channel blockers were the most commonly prescribed initial therapy for hypertension (41%), followed by ACE inhibitors (24%), thiazide diuretics (17%), and beta-blockers (10%). Eliminating patients with diabetes mellitus, CHF, angina, or history of MI did not substantially affect these results. Overall, initial use of a thiazide declined from 22% in 1991 to 10% in 1995, while initial use of a calcium channel blocker increased from 28% to 43%, despite publication during these years of studies demonstrating a benefit of thiazides in older patients.

We investigated the additional efficacy of the calcium antagonists amlodipine and nifedipine when added to bisoprolol in patients with stable angina. Patients were randomised in a multicentre, single-blind study, with crossover of three treatments consisting of bisoprolol 10 mg once daily, bisoprolol plus nifedipine 20 mg twice daily, and bisoprolol plus amlodipine 5 mg once daily. Exercise tests were performed at the end of each four-week study period and the exercise time to onset of angina was assessed. A total of 198 patients from 17 centres were recruited of whom 147 were evaluable for efficacy. There were no statistically significant differences in exercise duration to onset of angina between any of the groups. The combination of bisoprolol plus nifedipine was least well tolerated. In summary, this study suggests there is little benefit in adding a calcium antagonist to bisoprolol in treating patients with stable angina.",E,E

Hypertension has been shown to carry an increased risk not only for cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality but also for cognitive impairment and dementia. Although diastolic blood pressure is considered an important risk factor, it is now clear that isolated systolic hypertension and elevated pulse pressure also play an important role in the development of brain complications. Therefore the treatment of these conditions must urgently become a widespread tool of prevention. All the randomised placebo-controlled trials completed for the last 30 years have shown a reduction in fatal and/or non-fatal strokes. In the most recent trials in isolated systolic hypertension in older patients, the benefit was even greater because of the higher risk in these populations. The new classes of drugs, in particular, calcium-channels blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, have been shown to be as effective as the originally used diuretics and beta-blockers. Active treatment in the Syst-Eur trial based on nitrendipine as first step, possibly associated with enalapril and/or hydrochlorthiazide reduced not only stroke and cardiovascular complications but also the incidence of dementia including Alzheimer's disease. This important finding must be confirmed by further trials specifically focusing on the prevention of dementia. In addition, the importance of pulse pressure as a risk factor, underlines the need for new drugs which could increase aortic distensibility and decrease systolic blood pressure without greatly reducing diastolic pressure. Improving the management of hypertension offers new opportunities to reduce age-related disease in older people and to promote healthy aging.",E,E

The optimal strategy to treat the condition has not been established. Several retrospective studies have suggested that a primary rate-control strategy may be equivalent to a strategy that restores sinus rhythm.; Fifty patients with atrial fibrillation after heart surgery were randomly assigned to a strategy of antiarrhythmic therapy with or without electrical cardioversion or ventricular rate control. Both arms received anticoagulation with heparin overlapped with warfarin. The primary end point was time to conversion to sinus rhythm analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Atrial fibrillation relapse after the initial conversion was monitored in the hospital over a 2-month period.; There was no significant difference between an antiarrhythmic conversion strategy (n = 27) and a rate-control strategy (n = 23) in time to conversion to sinus rhythm (11.2 +/- 3. 2 vs 11.8 +/- 3.9 hours; P =.8). With the use of Cox multivariate analysis to control for the effects of age, sex, beta-blocker usage, and type of surgery, the antiarrhythmic strategy showed a trend toward reducing the time from treatment to restoration of sinus rhythm (P =.08). The length of hospital stay was reduced in the antiarrhythmic arm compared with the rate-control strategy (9.0 +/- 0.7 vs 13.2 +/- 2.0 days; P =.05).

The IMPROVEMENT of Heart Failure survey investigated the knowledge and perceptions of over 1300 primary care physicians from 14 ESC member nations and the actual practice in over 11000 of their patients. Guidelines and clinical practice were compared. The survey suggested, in this large sample, that the quality of care was higher than previous smaller surveys have suggested but have also identified important deficiencies in knowledge and management that should be rectified. The COPERNICUS study demonstrated that carvedilol was remarkably well tolerated even in patients with very severe heart failure and that treatment was associated with a substantial reduction in mortality even among patients that would conventionally not be considered, by many, for beta-blocker therapy. The MUSTIC trial suggested that cardiac resynchronisation using biventricular pacing improved patients symptomatically whether or not the patient was in atrial fibrillation. Morbidity and mortality studies of cardiac resynchronisation are now underway. The ASPECT-II and APRICOT-II studies investigated the role of warfarin, aspirin and their combination for the long-term management of myocardial infarction. One interpretation of the data from these studies is that the combination of aspirin and warfarin is about as effective as warfarin alone but with a much higher incidence of side effects. Warfarin alone appeared superior to aspirin alone.

We therefore studied the relationship between the response of patients with IgA nephritis (IgAN) to ACEI/ATRA therapy by decreasing proteinuria and its effect on the selectivity index (SI) in these patients.; Forty-one patients with biopsy-proven IgAN entered a control trial, with 21 in the treatment group and 20 in the control group. The entry criteria included proteinuria of 1 g or more and/or renal impairment. Patients in the treatment group received ACEI/ATRA or both with three monthly increases in dosage. In the control group, hypertension was treated with atenolol, hydrallazine, or methyldopa. The following tests were performed at three monthly intervals: serum creatinine, total urinary protein, SI, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and low molecular weight (LMW) proteinuria.; After a mean duration of therapy of 13 +/- 5 months, in the treatment group, there was no significant change in serum creatinine, proteinuria, or SI, but in the control group, serum creatinine deteriorated from 1.8 +/- 0.8 to 2.3 +/- 1.1 mg/dL (P < 0.05). Among the 21 patients in the treatment group, 10 responded to ACEI/ATRA therapy determined as a decrease in proteinuria by 30% (responders), and the other 11 did not respond (nonresponders). Among the responders, SI improved from a mean of 0.26 +/- 0.07 to 0.18 +/- 0. 07 (P < 0.001), indicating a tendency toward selective proteinuria. This was associated with an improvement in serum creatinine from mean 1.7 +/- 0.6 to 1.5 +/- 0.6 mg/dL (P < 0.02) and a decrease in proteinuria from a mean of 2.3 +/- 1.1 to 0.7 +/- 0.5 g/day (P < 0. 001). After treatment, proteinuria in the treatment group (1.8 +/- 1. 6 g/day) was significantly less than in the control group (2.9 +/- 1. 8 g/day, P < 0.05). The post-treatment SI in the responder group (0. 18 +/- 0.07) was better than that of the nonresponder group (0.33 +/- 0.11, P < 0.002). Eight out of 21 patients in the treatment group who had documented renal impairment had improved renal function compared with two in the control group (chi2 = 4.4, P < 0. 05). Of the eight patients in the treatment group who improved their renal function, three normalized their renal function compared with one from the control group.; Our data suggest that ACEI/ATRA therapy may be beneficial in patients with IgAN with renal impairment and nonselective proteinuria, as such patients may respond to therapy with improvement in protein selectivity, decrease in proteinuria, and improvement in renal function. ACEI/ATRA therapy probably modifies pore size distribution by reducing the radius of large unselective pores, causing the shunt pathway to become less pronounced, resulting in less leakage of protein into the urine.",E,E

Tedisamil is a bradycardic agent resulting from its ability to inhibit transient outward current (I(to)) in atria. Tedisamil inhibits I(to), potassium current (IK), K(ATP) and the protein kinase A-activated chloride channel in ventricles as well as vascular IK and Ca(2+)-activated IK (IK((Ca))). Tedisamil prolongs cardiac action potentials and the corrected QT (QTc) of the ECG and also increases cardiac refractoriness. Tedisamil is anti-arrhythmic in animal models of ventricular arrhythmias and atrial flutter. The bradycardic effect of tedisamil is associated with a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand. On isolated rat ventricle, tedisamil is a positive inotrope and on isolated rabbit atria, tedisamil reverses the negative inotropic effect of pinacidil. Tedisamil contracts the isolated rat portal vein and aorta, reduces cromakalim-induced relaxations of contracted rat aorta and increases blood pressure in animals and humans. Tedisamil is 96% bound to plasma proteins, has a plasma half-life of about 10 h and is cleared from the kidney unchanged. Clinical trials have shown that the electrophysiology of tedisamil is that of a class III anti-arrhythmic. In coronary artery disease, tedisamil has no effect on inotropism and increases the threshold for angina. Potassium channel blockade with tedisamil may have advantages over calcium channel blockers or K(ATP) channel openers as an anti-ischaemic mechanism in coronary artery disease. In exercise-induced myocardial ischaemia, beta-blockers are probably favourable to tedisamil, as they will limit the increase in heart rate, contractility and blood pressure caused by sympathetic stimulation, whereas tedisamil will not. In heart failure patients, tedisamil reduces heart rate, but increases blood pressure. The usefulness of tedisamil as a bradycardic agent is limited by the increase in blood pressure. A drug that is bradycardic without increasing blood pressure would be an improvement on tedisamil as the master switch of nature for ischaemic heart disease.",E,E

Interpretation of these studies has been limited by small sample size, exclusion of high-risk subjects, no or reduced use of stents, lack of a cost- effectiveness evaluation, and absence of risk factor intervention (except for Atorvastatin versus Revascularization Treatment, which used aggressive low-density lipoprotein lowering with atorvastatin in the medical group only).

Lidocaine and bretylium in the treatment and prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmia are de-emphasized because of inefficacy, safety concerns (lidocaine), or shortage of drug (bretylium). Procainamide is effective for stable ventricular tachycardia, and amiodarone is effective in the treatment of shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation.

Antihypertensive drugs that are lipid soluble will pass through the placental barrier with ease whereas the most polar will not. Placental transfer diminishes under conditions that decrease the surface area or increase the thickness of the placenta. Highly protein-bound drugs form complexes which impair placental transfer while unbound drugs cross the placenta easily. The ionised drug form is highly charged and cannot cross lipid membranes while the un-ionised form can easily cross the placenta. A decrease in placental blood flow can slow down the transfer of lipid soluble drugs to the fetus. Close monitoring of the fetal and maternal condition is necessary for the rest of the pregnancy after antihypertensive therapy is commenced. Methyldopa is the initial drug of choice for long term oral antihypertensive therapy in pregnancy. Neither short term nor long term use of methyldopa is associated with adverse effects. In the short term (<6 weeks) beta-receptor antagonists are effective and well tolerated provided there are no signs of intrauterine growth impairment. ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors are contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy because they are teratogenic. Intravenous dihydralazine is widely used for rapid reductions of severely elevated blood pressure. The use of nifedipine concurrently with MgSO4 must be approached with caution because the combination is associated with severe hypotension, neuromuscular blockade and cardiac depression. In the last decade, knowledge of antihypertensive drugs used in pregnancy has improved and new drugs, e.g. calcium antagonists, which have been shown to have great potential for use in pregnancy, have been introduced. Safety for the fetus with newer drugs has not yet been adequately evaluated. Currently, well established and cost effective drugs such as methyldopa (long term use) and intravenous dihydralazine (rapid reduction) are the agents of choice to treat hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.",E,E

Recent data suggest that care of patients with CHF in specialized heart failure programs is associated with improved clinical outcomes.; Specialized heart failure care is associated with better utilization and higher dose of cardiovascular drugs.; Data from 133 patients with CHF referred to a heart failure program were analyzed. Mean functional class 3.1 +/- 0.5, left ventricular ejection fraction 19 +/- 8. Utilization and doses of cardiovascular drugs were examined at initial evaluation and at last visit, after an average period of 17 +/- 14 months. Hospitalization and survival data were determined.; Utilization of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers increased from 87 to 100% (p < 0.001). Average daily dose increased by 60%, from the equivalent of captopril 105 +/- 78 mg to 167 +/- 86 mg (p < 0.001). Utilization of the following drugs increased significantly: beta blockers (16-37%, p < 0.001), metolazone (10-23%, p = 0.007), spironolactone (1-36%, p < 0.001), amiodarone (7-15%, p = 0.05), hydralazine (1-9%, p = 0.004), and nitrates (20-33%, p = 0.03).

The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the effects of calcium antagonists and other antihypertensive drugs on major cardiovascular events.; We undertook a meta-analysis of trials in hypertension that assessed cardiovascular events and included at least 100 patients, who were randomly assigned intermediate-acting or long-acting calcium antagonists or other antihypertensive drugs and who were followed up for at least 2 years.; The nine eligible trials included 27,743 participants. Calcium antagonists and other drugs achieved similar control of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compared with patients assigned diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, or clonidine (n=15,044), those assigned calcium antagonists (n=12,699) had a significantly higher risk of acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.11-1.43], p=0.0003), congestive heart failure (1.25 [1.07-1.46], p=0.005), and major cardiovascular events (1.10 [1.02-1.18], p=0.018).

We did separate overviews of trials comparing active treatment regimens with placebo, trials comparing more intensive and less intensive blood-pressure-lowering strategies, and trials comparing treatment regimens based on different drug classes.; The hypotheses to be investigated, the trials to be included, and the outcomes to be studied were all selected before the results of any participating trial were known. Individual participant data or group tabular data were provided by each trial and combined by standard statistical techniques.; The overview of placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors (four trials, 12,124 patients mostly with coronary heart disease) revealed reductions in stroke (30% [95% CI 15-43]), coronary heart disease (20% [11-28]), and major cardiovascular events (21% [14-27]). The overview of placebo-controlled trials of calcium antagonists (two trials, 5520 patients mostly with hypertension) showed reductions in stroke (39% [15-56]) and major cardiovascular events (28% [13-41]). In the overview of trials comparing blood-pressure-lowering strategies of different intensity (three trials, 20,408 patients with hypertension), there were reduced risks of stroke (20% [2-35]), coronary heart disease (19% [2-33]), and major cardiovascular events (15% [4-24]) with more intensive therapy. In the overviews comparing different antihypertensive regimens (eight trials, 37,872 patients with hypertension), several differences in cause-specific effects were seen between calcium-antagonist-based therapy and other regimens, but each was of borderline significance.; Strong evidence of benefits of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists is provided by the overviews of placebo-controlled trials. There is weaker evidence of differences between treatment regimens of differing intensities and of differences between treatment regimens based on different drug classes. Data from continuing trials of blood-pressure-lowering drugs will substantially increase the evidence available about any real differences that might exist between regimens.",E,E

Ultrasonographic evaluations of femoral vascular changes have not been studied prospectively.; In the Angina Prognosis Study in Stockholm (APSIS), 809 patients with stable angina pectoris were studied prospectively during double-blind treatment with verapamil or metoprolol. Ultrasonographic assessments of intima-media thickness, lumen diameter and plaques in the carotid and femoral arteries were evaluated in a subgroup of 558 patients (182 females) with a mean age of 60 +/-7 years, and related to the risk of cardiovascular death (n = 18) or non-fatal myocardial infarction (n = 26), or revascularization (n = 70) during follow-up (median 3.0 years). Univariate Cox regression analyses showed that carotid intima-media thickness and plaques were related to the risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. Femoral intima-media thickness was related to cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction, as well as to revascularization, whereas femoral plaques were only related to the latter. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, previous cardiovascular disease and lipid status, carotid intima-media thickness failed to predict any cardiovascular event, whereas carotid plaques tended (P = 0.056) to predict the risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. Femoral intima-media thickness (P < 0.01) and plaques (P < 0.05) were also related to the risk of revascularization after adjustments.; Carotid and femoral vascular changes were differently related to cardiovascular events. Carotid intima-media thickness was a weak predictor of events, whereas femoral intima-media thickness predicted revascularization. Plaques in the carotid artery were related to cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction, whereas plaques in the femoral artery were related to revascularization. Evaluations of plaques provided better prediction than assessments of intima-media thickness in patients with stable angina.",E,E

Higher doses of both ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers appear to provide additional benefits. The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone, when used in severe heart failure, provides additional survival advantage when added to standard triple therapy. Angiotensin receptor blockers have not been shown to be superior to ACE inhibitors, and their role in heart failure treatment requires further investigation. No trial's data support the use of inotropic agents or calcium channel blockers in heart failure. A number of new therapeutic agents, including vasopressin antagonists and tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor antibody are in phase II and III clinical trials.

General recommendations regarding the use of beta-blockers in heart failure are also included to guide clinical practice.; Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and meta-analyses evaluating mortality reduction with beta-blockers in the treatment of heart failure were identified using a MEDLINE search from January 1993 to March 2000. Abstracts and presented results from recent scientific meetings were also considered.; Beta-blockers have been shown to decrease hospitalization for worsening heart failure, decrease the need for heart transplant, improve New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and increase left-ventricular ejection fraction. A mortality benefit has recently been demonstrated for patients with chronic heart failure. Carvedilol, bisoprolol, and controlled-release/extended-release metoprolol decreased the risk of dying by 65%, 34%, and 34%, respectively, in patients with primarily NYHA functional class II or III and systolic dysfunction. The benefit of these agents in patients with class IV heart failure or determining whether one agent has an advantage over another is being investigated in ongoing clinical trials.; Several beta-blockers have demonstrated mortality reduction in the treatment of patients with NYHA functional class II or III heart failure and systolic dysfunction.

A secondary aim was to relate the efficacy of the free and fixed combinations with pharmacokinetic profiles.; This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised three-way crossover multi-centre study. BP was measured for 26 h using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), which was performed on the last day of the three treatment phases.; Mean sitting BPs, measured during the trough period with ABPM, were significantly lower with both the free and fixed combinations of metoprolol and felodipine than placebo (141/83 mmHg free, 140/83 mmHg fixed, 156/93 mmHg placebo). The mean BPs measured over 24 h using ABPM were 143/82 mmHg, 140/82 mmHg and 158/93 mmHg for the free, fixed and placebo treatment arms, respectively. The trough-to-peak ratios (T:P) were 75% and 79% for the systolic BP and 70% and 70% for the diastolic BP for the free and fixed combinations, respectively. Pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed identical plasma concentration-time curves for felodipine given as the free or fixed combination. Comparison of the plasma concentration-time curves for metoprolol revealed a delay in the release rate from the fixed combination formulation. No significant differences in BP control between the active treatments were noted during this period. Of 26 patients entered into the study, 3 withdrew during active phase for non-drug-related reasons. No patient withdrew from active treatment due to treatment-related adverse events. The frequency of adverse event reporting for the fixed combination of felodipine and metoprolol was similar to that for placebo (60% and 58%, respectively).; The results suggest that once-daily dosing with either the free or fixed combination of felodipine 5 mg and metoprolol 50 mg produces a significant sustained reduction in systolic and diastolic BP with similar plasma concentration profiles over a 24-h period.",E,E

Assignment to the placebo group and the occurrence of cardiovascular events independently predicted missed assessments. From the reported findings, the risk of cognitive and functional impairment was similar between the two treatment groups. However, when 20-30% and 40-80% of the subjects who missed the assessment were assumed to be cognitively and, respectively, functionally impaired, assignment to active treatment reduced the risk of these outcomes. In the SHEP, the cognitive and functional evaluations were biased toward the null effect by differential dropout.

In this mechanistic study, we assessed the effect of 26 weeks metoprolol treatment in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. All patients received metoprolol sustained release (200 mg; n=12) or placebo (n=12). Assessments were made at baseline and after 10 and 26 weeks' treatment. At baseline, norepinephrine levels were elevated, while HR variability parameters were decreased in patients vs. controls (both P<0.05). Autonomic function testing showed only small differences, although significant alterations were observed with deep breathing and head up tilting (both P<0.05). After 26 weeks', metoprolol did not affect exercise capacity or norepinephrine concentrations. In contrast, HR variability was markedly improved in metoprolol-treated patients vs. placebo-treated patients (P<0.05). In particular, a shift toward normal in the sympathovagal balance was observed (P<0.05). Autonomic function testing showed only small, and generally non-significant trends after metoprolol.; Marked autonomic abnormalities are already present in mild CHF, which may be (partially) reversed by metoprolol.

All death certificates were obtained and coded, and deaths potentially related to coronary heart disease were selected and validated by standardized methods blinded to ethnicity. Validated in-hospital and out-of-hospital coronary heart disease mortality was compared between 785 Mexican Americans and 862 non-Hispanic white women and men.; Validated coronary heart disease mortality in Mexican Americans exceeded that for non-Hispanic whites in the same community. Among women, definite coronary heart disease mortality was 40% greater among Mexican Americans (rate ratio [RR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12 to 1.82), as was all coronary heart disease mortality (RR, 1.32, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.63).

However, only the atenolol-treated patients showed a significant early reduction in heart rate. Infarct size, obtained from the perfusion defect in resting single photon emission imaging, was higher in captopril-treated patients than in atenolol-treated patients: 29.8+/-12% versus 20.8+/-12% (P:<0.01) by polar map and 28.3+/-13% versus 20.0+/-13% (P:<0.01) by tomography. Changes from baseline to 1 week and to 3 months in ventricular end-diastolic volume, assessed by echocardiography, were as follows: 58+/-14 versus 64+/-19 (P<0.05) and 65+/-21 mL/m(2) (P<0.05), respectively, with captopril, and 58+/-18 versus 64+/-18 (P<0.05) and 69+/-30 mL/m(2) (P<0.05), respectively, with atenolol.

Early recognition and prevention therapies, combined with lifestyle modification, are essential in the treatment of heart failure. Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics is now standard. Digoxin is added to improve clinical symptoms, especially in patients with atrial fibrillation.

QT dispersion was calculated by subtracting the shortest QT from the longest QT, in absolute value (Qtmax-Qtmin). It was also corrected with Bazett's formula (QTc dispersion). After 6 weeks of treatment, QT and QTc dispersion were significantly decreased in the bisoprolol group (QT dispersion: 66.5+/-13.4 ms vs. 49.1+/-16.8 ms for ischemic heart disease (P<0.01); 67.5+/-12.4 ms vs. 59.4+/-14.4 ms for dilated cardiomyopathy (P<0.05); QTc dispersion: 78.3+/-15.2 ms vs. 53.3+/-18.1 ms for ischemic heart disease (P<0.01); 79.1+/-14.2 ms vs. 69.0+/-17.9 ms for dilated cardiomyopathy (P<0.05)), but there was no significant decrease of QT and QTc dispersion in the control group. Linear regression analysis showed that patients with ischemic heart disease tend to have lower 6-week QT dispersion than patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (coefficient beta=-0.283, P=0.009) after controlling for their baseline values in the bisoprolol group.; These findings suggested that bisoprolol reduces QT and QTc dispersion in patients with chronic heart failure, but the etiology of heart failure affects the response of patients to bisoprolol.",E,E

11189013,"Rationale, design and organization of the Second Chinese Cardiac Study (CCS-2): a randomized trial of clopidogrel plus aspirin, and of metoprolol, among patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction. Second Chinese Cardiac Study (CCS-2) Collaborative Group.","Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Aspirin; China; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Metoprolol; Myocardial Infarction; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Research Design; Ticlopidine",NA,"Assessing combined anti-platelet therapy in suspected acute myocardial infarction Aspirin has been shown to be effective in the emergency treatment of acute myocardial infarction. It irreversibly inhibits platelet cyclo-oxygenase and thereby prevents the formation of the platelet aggregating agent thromboxane A2. Clopidogrel is an anti-platelet agent that acts by a different mechanism, inhibiting adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation. Simultaneous inhibition of both of these pathways might produce significantly greater anti-platelet effects than inhibition of either alone. The Second Chinese Cardiac Study (CCS-2) will reliably determine whether adding oral clopidogrel to aspirin for up to 4 weeks in hospital after suspected acute myocardial infarction can produce a greater reduction in the risk of major vascular events than can be achieved by giving aspirin alone. In order to be able to detect a further reduction of 10-15%, some 20,000-40,000 patients in over 1000 Chinese hospitals will be randomized. Assessing early beta-blocker therapy in suspected acute myocardial infarction Although over 27,000 patients have been studied previously in randomized trials of short-term beta-blocker therapy in acute myocardial infarction, the reduction in early mortality (513 (3.7%) for beta-blocker therapy deaths versus 586 (4.3%) for control deaths) was only just conventionally significant (P = 0.02) and, overall, the absolute benefits were small in the relatively low-risk patients studied. Although there might be worthwhile benefit in higher risk patients, there is currently little routine use of beta-blocker therapy in acute myocardial infarction. Hence, patients in CCS-2 will also be randomly allocated to receive metoprolol (intravenous then oral) or matching placebo for up to 4 weeks in hospital in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Such a design allows all patients to contribute fully to assessment of the separate effects of the anti-platelet regimen and the beta-blocker (without any material effect on study cost or sample size requirements) whilst also providing information about their combined effects. A streamlined trial in a wide range of patients In order to randomize 20,000-40,000 patients, the design of CCS-2 has been streamlined: data collection and other extra work for collaborators is minimal, allowing busy hospitals to take part easily. All patients presenting within 24 h of the onset of suspected acute myocardial infarction are eligible for the study provided they have a definite ECG abnormality and are not persistently hypotensive, and provided the doctor responsible considers there to be no clear indication for or contraindication to either of the trial treatments. Apart from administration of the trial treatments, all other aspects of individual patient management are entirely at the discretion of the doctor responsible. By including many different types of patient from many different types of hospital, with wide variation in ancillary management, the CCS-2 results will be of direct clinical relevance to the heterogeneous realities of future clinical practice. The trial began in July 1999 and is expected to be completed by the year 2003.",E,E

The main indications for digoxin usage include atrial fibrillation and heart failure; both these conditions are more prevalent in older patients. Given the aging population and the increasing incidence of heart failure we would expect prescribing of digoxin to remain as frequent or to even increase in older patients. Older patients are also more likely to develop toxicity and diagnosis of digoxin toxicity can be difficult in this group. Numerous components contribute to the development of toxicity in older patients, ranging from aging-related changes in renal function or body mass to polypharmacy and possible interactions with digoxin. It is therefore important to understand how the pharmacokinetics of digoxin may be altered in the older population. Application of basic pharmacological principles may be helpful in anticipating these problems. This review describes the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, the changes in pharmacokinetics with increasing age and how concomitant disease states or drug interactions may affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Greater knowledge about the causes and prevention of digoxin toxicity should further reduce the morbidity and mortality arising from digoxin toxicity, especially in the elderly population.",5,E

Device programming was based on clinically documented and induced ventricular arrhythmias. In ambulatory patients, sinus tachycardia preceded ventricular arrhythmias more often than in the hospital during exercise testing. The incidence of these VTs could be reduced by increasing the dose of a beta-blocking agent in only two patients. In five patients in whom sinus tachycardia developed after onset of hemodynamic stable VT, propranolol was more effective than Class III antiarrhythmics combined with another beta-blocking agent with regard to the incidence of VT and pace termination. In all but three cases, atrial arrhythmias were present for a longer time before the onset of ventricular arrhythmias. During atrial arrhythmias, fast ventricular rates before the onset of ventricular rate were observed more often than RR irregularities and short-long RR sequences. Dual chamber diagnostics allowed proper interpretation of detection and therapy outcome in patients with different types of ventricular arrhythmia.; The advantages of the dual chamber ICD system go further than avoiding the shortcomings of the single chamber system.

The response rate at endpoint was 16% greater in patients treated with the combination. The plasma concentration of pindolol remained stable between 3 days (first blood sampling) and 6 weeks. Mean values were approximately 26 nM, a concentration higher than the Ki of (-)pindolol for human 5-HT1A autoreceptors (11 nM). Plasma fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations increased steadily until the fourth week of treatment. Fluoxetine concentrations were lower in patients receiving the combination (p = 0.043), but there was no significant relationship to the clinical response in either group. A reanalysis of the data using a survival analysis revealed that significant differences in the time to sustained response between both groups would have also been detected (1) in a 2-week trial, (2) without a placebo lead-in phase, and (3) with less frequent visits. However, the use of ""response"" instead of ""sustained response"" as measure of clinically relevant change would have greatly diminished the difference between treatment arms (p = 0.08 instead of p = 0.01). This emphasizes the need of using stringent outcome criteria in antidepressant drug trials. A comparison of the data of all sustained responders (N = 27) in the fluoxetine-plus-placebo group with the first 27 responders in the fluoxetine-plus-pindolol group (of a total of 38) revealed a highly significant difference in the time to sustained response (18 and 10 days, respectively; p = 0.0002).

Hypertension, especially systolic hypertension, is the single most common, powerful, however, treatable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the elderly. In order to assess the effectiveness of antihypertensive drug therapy among the elderly, with diuretics, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, a literature search was performed at the Cochrane Library, Medline and Excerpta medica. The Cochrane Hypertension Group identified 14 randomised controlled trials of at least one year duration with 21,785 elderly subjects where diuretics, beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers were used in the treatment group as first line drugs. In their meta-analysis (including one small trial with a central acting antiadrenergic drug) there was a decrease in total mortality (111 vs 129 deaths) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (126 vs 177 events) within the treatment group. The three trials restricted to persons with isolated systolic hypertension indicated beneficial effects in the treatment group with regard to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (104 vs 157 events).

In three studies, where adverse effects were reported, no substantial differences between treatment and control groups in measures of physical, cognitive and emotional function were found. Cardiovascular benefits of treatment with low dose diuretics or beta-blockers are cleared for elderly subjects with either diastolic or isolated systolic hypertension. Treatment with a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker shows beneficial effects in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for elderly people with isolated systolic hypertension. Due to inconsistent findings in a subgroup meta-analysis of antihypertensive drug treatment in very old people, the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment in these subjects still remains unclear.",I,8

Randomised trials have already demonstrated that treating healthy older persons with hypertension is highly efficacious. Nevertheless some questions have arisen. On the one hand the generalizability of these trial results, particularly for older persons with serious medical comorbidities and poor functional status, is not clear. On the other hand different antihypertensive drugs have shown to be effective. Which drug for which patient? Even data from randomised intervention trials showing that the treatment affects cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, were missing, ACE inhibitors have been used for more than a decade to treat high blood pressure. For a younger population the captopril prevention project showed no differences between ACE inhibitors and conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics, beta-blocker) concerning the primary endpoints (myocardial infarction, stroke and other cardiovascular death). The STOP-2 study also confirmed these results for elderly patients. When treating elderly patients one must be aware of physiological changes with age and the comorbidities. Of significance among this patient group is declining renal function. Admissions for uraemia that are related to the use of ACE inhibitors are still commonplace, although many cases are preventable by monitoring renal function, but guidelines are still missing. Concerning the comorbidities ACE inhibitors have benefits compared to other antihypertensive drugs, especially in cases of heart failure, diabetes and coronary heart disease.",1,E

Classical studies have characterized single gene polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes that are responsible for large interindividual differences in pharmacokinetic responses to several antihypertensive drugs. Progress is being made using candidate gene and genome scanning approaches to identify and characterize many additional genes influencing pharmacodynamic mechanisms that contribute to interindividual differences in responses to antihypertensive drug therapy. Knowledge of polymorphic variation in these genes will help to predict individual patients' blood pressure responses to antihypertensive drug therapy and may also provide new insights into molecular mechanisms responsible for elevation of blood pressure.,5,E

A total of 160 newly diagnosed hypertensive men (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] > or = 95 mm Hg and < 110 mm Hg), aged 40 to 49 years, all married and without any previous sexual disfunction, were enrolled. After a 4-week placebo period, the patients were divided into two groups: a) 120 patients were randomized to receive carvedilol 50 mg once daily or valsartan 80 mg once daily for 16 weeks according to a double-blind, cross-over design; after another 4-week placebo period, patients were crossed over to the alternative regimen for a further 16 weeks; b) 40 patients were treated with placebo according to a single-blind design for 16 weeks. At the screening visit and every 4 weeks thereafter, blood pressure (BP) was evaluated and patients were interviewed by a questionnaire about their sexual activity. Blood pressure was significantly lowered by both treatments, with a 48% of normalization with valsartan and 45% with carvedilol. During the first month of therapy, sexual activity (assessed as number of sexual intercourse episodes per month) declined with both drugs as compared with baseline, although the decrease was statistically significant in the carvedilol (from 8.2 to 4.4 sexual intercourse episodes, P < .01) but not in the valsartan-treated patients (from 8.3 to 6.6 sexual intercourse episodes, not significant). Ongoing with the treatment the sexual activity further worsened with carvedilol (3.7 sexual intercourse episodes per month) while fully recovered and also improved with valsartan (10.2 sexual intercourse episodes per month). The results were confirmed by the cross-over. Erectile dysfunction was a complaint of 15 patients with carvedilol (13.5%), one patient with valsartan (0.9%), and one patient in the placebo group. These findings suggest that carvedilol induces a chronic worsening of sexual activity, whereas valsartan not only does not significantly worsen sexual activity but may even improve it.",I,E

There have been major advances in the primary and secondary prevention of variceal haemorrhage over the last 20 years involving endoscopic, radiological and pharmacological approaches. This review concentrates principally on drug therapy, particularly on the numerous haemodynamic studies. Many of these drugs have not been studied in clinical trials, but provide data about the underlying pathogenesis of portal hypertension. Also covered in this review are the randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses that involve a large number of patients. These trials involve relatively few drugs such as non-selective beta-blockers and nitrates. Correlations between haemodynamic and clinical parameters are discussed. Despite the recent increase in the use of alternative endoscopic therapies, an effective and well tolerated drug remains a clinically important research goal.",5,E

As the heart begins to fail to meet the body's metabolic demands, the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system are activated. These interrelated systems act in concert to facilitate cardiac output and tissue perfusion. Though these neurohormonal systems are initially compensatory, evidence suggests that they promote deleterious cardiac remodeling and myocyte destruction. Recent studies in patients with heart failure have targeted the RAAS and sympathetic nervous system for therapeutic intervention. This article reviews major recent multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials in heart failure that have resulted in a new standard of care for patients with this devastating disease.",E,E

This study investigated the daily variation of azygos blood flow (AzBF) and portal blood flow (PBF) and the effects of propranolol administration given once in evening in cirrhotics.; Blood flow were measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Hemodynamic parameters were determined at 08:00, 16:00 24:00 and again 08:00 h, and were measured at baseline and after 14 days oral administration of propranolol (30 mg, n = 7) or placebo (n = 7) at 19:00 h in 14 patients.; A daily fluctuation of AzBF and PBF was observed, peaking at 24:00 h in nine patients. In three other patients, peak AzBF and PBF were observed both at 16:00 and 24:00 h. Two patients were constant throughout the day. When the daily variation was compared, ANOVA showed a significant difference (P < 0.001). Propranolol administration at 19:00 h reduced AzBF (-40.7 +/- 17.9% vs. baseline, P < 0.001) and PBF (-26.5 +/- 10.7% vs. baseline, P < 0.01) at 24:00 h.; We found that in most cirrhotics, AzBF and PBF peaks at midnight. Dosing of propranolol in the evening may be important for its role in preventing variceal bleeding.",E,E

Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were measured by a constant infusion technique. The reference substances used were [131I]iodohippurate (Hippuran) and [125I]iothalamate. The lithium clearance method was used for measuring renal water and sodium handling. Microalbuminuria was measured. A subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken and the media thickness to lumen diameter ratio of small resistance vessels was determined. Left ventricular mass index was determined by echocardiography. Thirty-seven patients with newly diagnosed or poorly controlled essential hypertension were randomized to treatment with regimens based upon either isradipine, perindopril or hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride. Atenolol and hydralazine were added as secondary and tertiary drugs, respectively, when needed for normalization of diastolic blood pressure. Investigations were performed before and after 9 months of normalization of blood pressure. Renal function in untreated hypertensive patients was characterized by increased renal vascular resistance, decreased renal blood flow, normal glomerular filtration fraction and normal serum creatinine. No association was found between peripheral resistance vessel structure in subcutaneous vessels and renal hemodynamic parameters. Patients with severe left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass >360 g) had lower glomerular filtration fraction, greater renal vascular resistance, lower renal blood flow and increased microalbuminuria in comparison with patients with less pronounced cardiac changes. After 1 year of treatment, which had a profound effect on heart and vessel structure, renal hemodynamics were unchanged in patients receiving antihypertensive treatment regimens based on the ACE inhibitor perindopril or the Ca-antagonist isradipine, whereas renal plasma flow was reduced, glomerular filtration rate preserved and filtration fraction significantly increased in those treated with a regimen based on diuretics. The serum creatinine concentration was decreased in the former group, whereas it was unchanged in the latter two. Significantly detrimental effect on uric acid homeostasis was only found in patients treated with a regimen based on diuretics.",E,E

Therefore, a rather slow sinus rate appears to be a protecting factor acting through several mechanisms. The present contribution focuses on the relationship between sinus rate and heart failure. Its major objectives are to discuss whether in patients with heart failure a rather slow heart rate is advisable and whether a sinus bradycardia secondary to sinus node dysfunction can facilitate the development of heart failure. It has been reported that among patients with left ventricular dysfunction, increased sinus rate was a predictor of cardiovascular death at univariate analysis; however, a multivariate analysis to verify whether sinus rate was an independent predictor of mortality was not performed. Randomized trials carried out by utilizing beta-blockers or amiodarone in patients with heart failure showed that heart rate reduction by these drugs was a marker of their ability to reduce mortality. However, beta-blockers and amiodarone have additional pharmacological effects which interfere with the disease substrate. So, at present, though the results of these trials show that a rather slow sinus rate is advisable, we do not know whether in patients with heart failure sinus rate represents an independent predictor of mortality as in patients with myocardial infarction or hypertension and whether the reduction of sinus rate per se is beneficial. The results of the recent randomized THEOPACE trial showed, for the first time, that in a patient population with symptomatic sinus bradycardia (sinus rate < 50 b/min), an increase in heart rate, induced by DDD pacing or oral theophylline, reduced the incidence of overt heart failure. Therefore, sinus bradycardia seems to play a role in the genesis of heart failure. In a post-hoc analysis of the results of this trial it emerged that in the control (not treated) group, the subjects with sinus bradycardia more prone to develop heart failure were those of old age, about 80 years, with organic heart disease and severe chronotropic incompetence. However, this conclusion needs further validation.",E,E

As education of patients is fundamental in order to improve their compliance, we organised two pilot educational meetings aimed at (1) assessing the support of patients to this kind of meetings, and (2) verifying the impact on patient's education.; We invited 225 consecutive patients referred to our Hypertension Clinic (some of them regularly followed up and some referred for the first time) to participate to an educational meeting on hypertension. Patients were divided in two groups, for organising reasons each attending a single meeting. Each meeting included four sessions: (1) the first session included a multiple choice questionnaire (nine questions, with answers collected by an interactive electronic system) in order to evaluate the degree of patient's information about hypertension (definition, prevalence, aetiology, complications and treatment), (2) a traditional teaching session, (3) an interactive phase aimed to assess the improvement of knowledge in which the same questions as in the first session have been asked again, and (4) a general discussion session.; A total of 144 patients (mean age 54 +/- 12 years; 76 M, 68 F) of the 225 invited attended the meeting. The answers to our questions in the initial session were correct in a percentage ranging from 60% to 80%. During the third phase immediately after the teaching session, the percentage of correct answers increased significantly (range: 75--98%, P < 0.05 at least in all questions).; This study shows: (1) a satisfactory adherence of patients to this educational initiative; (2) a positive impact of a single educational meeting on patient's knowledge about issues related to hypertension. The potential role of improving patient's education on clinical outcomes such as blood pressure levels and the rate of blood pressure control requires future controlled studies.

Several studies have evaluated the ocular hypotensive properties and side effects of latanoprost in different forms of glaucoma. This drug, seems to be the most effective intraocular pressure (IOP)-reducing agent currently available, and has a low incidence of ocular and systemic side effects. Fewer data are available regarding unoprostone, but the IOP-reducing effect of this drug seems to be comparable or slightly inferior to that of timolol and it produces fewer side effects. When compared with unoprostone, latanoprost has been shown to effect a greater reduction in IOP. A major drawback to the use of prostaglandin analogues is the lack of long-term experience such as that currently available for other classes of agents.",4,E

Fluoxetine (20 mg) or matching placebo was administered in a randomized, double-blind, two-period crossover study to 10 patients previously identified as extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Patients were maintained on a carvedilol dose of 25 or 50 mg bid and given fluoxetine/placebo for a minimum of 28 days. Plasma was collected over the 12-hour carvedilol dosing interval, and the concentrations of the R(+) and S(-) enantiomers of carvedilol were measured. CYP2D6 phenotype was assessed during each study period using dextromethorphan (30 mg). Changes in autonomic modulation between study periods were measured by heart rate variability in the time and frequency domains using ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Compared to placebo, fluoxetine coadministration resulted in a 77% increase in mean (+/- SD) R(+) enantiomer AUC0-12 (522 +/- 413 vs. 927 +/- 506 ng.h/mL, p = 0.01) and a nonsignificant increase in S(-) enantiomer AUC (244 +/- 185 vs. 330 +/- 179 ng.h/mL, p = 0.17). Mean apparent oral clearance for both enantiomers decreased significantly with fluoxetine administration (R(+): 10.3 +/- 7.2 vs. 4.5 +/- 2.2 mL/min/kg; S(-): 22.5 +/- 12.3 vs. 12.6 +/- 7.4 mL/min/kg; p = 0.004 and 0.03, respectively). No differences in adverse effects, blood pressure, or heart rate were noted between treatment groups, and there were no consistent changes in heart rate variability parameters. In conclusion, fluoxetine administration resulted in a stereospecific inhibition of carvedilol metabolism, with the R(+) enantiomer increasing to a greater extent than the S(-) enantiomer. However, this interaction was of little clinical significance in our sample population.",I,E

Another less-appreciated potential drawback is their propensity to cause weight gain in some patients. In 8 evaluable prospective randomized controlled trials that lasted >/=6 months, body weight was higher in the beta-blocker than in the control group at the end of the study. The median difference in body weight was 1.2 kg (range -0.4 to 3.5 kg). A regression analysis suggested that beta-blockers were associated with an initial weight gain during the first few months. Thereafter, no further weight gain compared with controls was apparent. There was no relationship between demographic characteristics and changes in body weight. Based on these observations, the first-line use of beta-blockers in obese hypertensive patients should be reviewed. Obesity management in overweight hypertensive patients may be more difficult in the face of beta-blocker treatment.",5,E

The apparent efficacy of vasodilator drugs led to the first randomized, controlled trial in heart failure that demonstrated that all impedance-lowering drugs did not exert the same long-term benefit. Differences on the structural remodeling process in the myocardium and arterial vasculature were shown to account for the differential long-term response. We now recognize that the remodeling process in the left ventricle may be inhibited by nitrates, converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers, and this growth process leads to adverse outcomes. The impedance load on the left ventricle is influenced by vascular remodeling that also may be inhibited by drugs such as converting enzyme inhibitors. Thus, progression of cardiovascular disease is largely a consequence of structural changes that are hormonally mediated and may be inhibited by drug therapy.",E,E

Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), monocyte chemoattractant peptide-1, and IL-8 were measured at baseline, after 3 months, and at the end of the study (11.4 +/- 0.4 months).; Our main findings were (1) at baseline TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant peptide-1, and sIL-2R but not IL-10 levels were markedly elevated in patients with CHF compared with controls; (2) during treatment with metoprolol, but not with placebo, there was a significant decrease in sIL-2R after 3 months, with a return to baseline at the end of the study; and (3) levels of all other immunologic variables remained unchanged throughout the study in both the metoprolol and the placebo groups.; Our findings suggest that metoprolol treatment in CHF is associated with a significant but temporary decrease in sIL-2R, possibly reflecting down-modulation of T-cell activation. However, an enhanced immune activation also persisted in the metoprolol group, suggesting a potential for more specific immunomodulatory therapy in CHF.",E,E

The baseline characteristics and treatment of 200 CHF patients recruited to a randomised study of a non-pharmacological intervention in Australia and 157 CHF patients concurrently recruited to a similar study in Scotland were compared. Subsequent health outcomes (including survival and readmission) within 3 months of discharge in those patients who received usual post-discharge care in Australia (n=100) and Scotland (n=75) were also compared. Individuals in both countries were predominantly old and frail with significant comorbidity likely to complicate treatment. Similar proportions of Australian and Scottish patients were prescribed either a 'high' (20 vs. 18%) or medium (64 vs. 66%) dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Proportionately more Australian patients were prescribed a long-acting nitrate, digoxin and/or a beta-blocker.

Theoretically, all patients with heart failure may benefit from treatment designed to retard progressive ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias. Patients with ischemic heart disease may also theoretically benefit from the relief of ischemia, the prevention of coronary occlusion, and revascularization. However, there is little evidence to show that the presence or absence of coronary disease modifies the benefits of effective treatments such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. Moreover, there is no evidence that treatment directed specifically at myocardial ischemia or coronary disease alters outcome in patients with heart failure. Treatments aimed at relieving painless myocardial ischemia have not been shown to alter prognosis. Lipid-lowering therapy is theoretically attractive for patients with heart failure and coronary disease; however, theoretical concerns also exist about the safety of such agents, and patients with heart failure have been excluded from large outcome studies very effectively. Some agents, such as aspirin, designed to reduce the risk of coronary occlusion seem ineffective or harmful in patients with heart failure, although warfarin may be safe and possibly effective. There is no evidence yet that revascularization improves prognosis in patients with heart failure, even in patients who are shown to have extensive myocardial hibernation. On current evidence, revascularization should be reserved for the relief of angina. Large-scale, randomized controlled trials are currently underway that are investigating the role of specific treatments targeted at coronary syndromes. The Carvedilol Hibernation Reversible Ischemia Trial: Marker of Success study is investigating the effects of carvedilol in a large cohort of patients with and without hibernating myocardium.

Most of these strokes occur in patients older than 75 years of age. The high incidence of stroke in very elderly persons reflects the increasing prevalence of atrial fibrillation that occurs with advanced age, the high incidence of stroke in elderly patients, and the failure of physicians to prescribe antithrombotic therapy in most of these patients. This failure is related to the increased risk for major hemorrhage with advanced age, obfuscating the decision to institute stroke prophylaxis with antithrombotic therapy. This case-based review describes the risk and benefits of prescribing antithrombotic therapy for a hypothetical 80-year-old man who has atrial fibrillation and hypertension, and it offers practical advice on managing warfarin therapy. After concluding that the benefits of warfarin outweigh its risks in this patient, we describe how to initiate warfarin therapy cautiously and how to monitor and dose the drug. We then review five recent randomized, controlled trials that document the increased risk for stroke when an international normalized ratio (INR) of less than 2.0 is targeted among patients with atrial fibrillation. Next, we make the case that cardioversion is not needed for this asymptomatic patient with chronic atrial fibrillation. Instead, we choose to leave the patient in atrial fibrillation and to control his ventricular rate with atenolol. Later, when the INR increases to 4.9, we advocate withholding one dose of warfarin and repeating the INR test. Finally, when the patient develops dental pain, we review the analgesic agents that are safe to take with warfarin and explain why warfarin therapy does not have to be interrupted during a subsequent dental extraction.",E,E

Among those patients receiving canrenoate, the mitral E/A ratio was higher compared to the placebo group (p = 0.001) whereas the ESV was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The deceleration time for reperfused patients receiving canrenoate was higher than that observed for reperfused patients in the placebo group. The intragroup EF was significantly increased (p = 0.042). Compared to the placebo group, the IVRT was significantly higher for unreperfused patients receiving canrenoate than in the placebo group (p = 0.001). Serum creatinine, blood urea and K levels as well as the incidence and extent of vessel disease were similar for both groups. No side effects were observed during the study period.; Our data suggest that the combination of captopril plus canrenoate is feasible for the initial treatment of patients presenting with AMI. Besides, compared to captopril alone it is more efficacious in improving the E/A ratio, the ESV, the EF, and the IVRT.",E,E

Consecutive patients, men and women < or =70 years were identified retrospectively with the following diagnoses: coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, acute myocardial infarction and myocardial ischaemia. Data collection was based on a review of medical records and interview and risk assessment at least 6 months after hospital admission.; 8181 medical records (25% women) were reviewed and 5556 patients (adjusted participation rate 76%) interviewed. Recording of risk factor history and risk factor measurement in hospital notes was incomplete, particularly for discharge documents. At interview (median time 1.4 years after hospital discharge), 21% of patients smoked cigarettes, 31% were obese, 50% had raised blood pressure (systolic blood pressure > or =140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > or =90 mmHg), 58% had elevated serum total cholesterol (total cholesterol > or =5 mmol x l(-1)) and 20% reported a medical history of diabetes. Glucose control in these diabetic patients was poor with 87% having plasma glucose >6.0 mmol x l(-1)and 72% > or =7.0 mmol x l(-1). Among the patients interviewed the use of prophylactic drug therapies on admission, at discharge and at interview was as follows: aspirin or other antiplatelets drugs 47%, 90% and 86%; beta-blockers 44%, 66% and 63%; ACE inhibitors 24%, 38% and 38%; and lipid-lowering drugs 26%, 43% and 61%, respectively. With the exception of antiplatelet drugs, wide variations in the use of prophylactic drug therapies exist between countries.; This European survey of coronary patients shows a high prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles, modifiable risk factors and inadequate use of drug therapies to achieve blood pressure and lipid goals. There is considerable potential throughout Europe to raise the standard of preventive cardiology through more effective lifestyle intervention, control of other risk factors and optimal use of prophylactic drug therapies in order to reduce coronary morbidity and mortality.",E,E

However, not all patients respond uniformly to this therapy. We proposed to identify variables that could, potentially, be used to predict response to carvedilol therapy as measured by the change in LVEF after treatment (Delta LVEF), and to identify pretreatment variables associated with hospitalization for heart failure after carvedilol therapy.; A retrospective analysis of 98 patients treated with open-label carvedilol for a mean period of 16 months was performed by using bivariate and step-wise multivariate analyses. Bivariate analysis showed a positive correlation of Delta LVEF with heart rate at baseline (P =.001). There was a negative correlation of Delta LVEF with baseline LVEF (P <.01), diabetes mellitus (P =.04), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (P =.0002). Multivariate analysis showed a positive correlation of Delta LVEF with heart rate at baseline (P =.01) and a negative correlation with initial LVEF (P =.02) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (P =.006).

These results, transposed to the French population, may be used to evaluate the economic advantages of Carvedilol by developing a cost-effectiveness study which consists in relating the direct expenses (drugs and hospital admissions) of each of the two strategies, with or without Carvedilol, to their respective mortalities. Hospital expenses were estimated with respect to the H.M.G. corresponding to each hospital stay at 1997-1998 values. The cost in the Carvedilol group was 2,823 FF per patient (including 1,491 FF for the drug itself) but 2,056 FF were economised in hospital expenses. With an increased cost of 767 FF but a 50% reduction in mortality corresponding to a difference in mortality of 45@1000, the cost-effectiveness of Carvedilol was 17,040 per life saved and 2,130 FF per additional year of life expectancy. A study of the sensitivity produced even more favourable results of Carvedilol. An evaluation of hospital expenses on the basis of AP-HP data indicates that the addition of Carvedilol is associated with a 4,425 FF reduction in hospital expenses, which makes it a cost saving strategy.",1,E

Subjects were recruited from patients attending other outpatient clinics and entered into the study if their SBP was more than 150 mm Hg after three visits. Patients were given a low and high dose of each of the main classes of drugs or placebo for 1 month each. The study was a balanced, randomized crossover design with five periods: placebo; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; beta-blocking drugs; calcium-blocking drugs; and thiazide diuretics. Blood pressure (BP) was measured 24 to 26 h after the previous dose. A questionnaire for side effects was administered at each visit. Seventy-four patients entered the study. beta-Blockers could not be used in 15 patients because of asthma or bronchospasm and these had two placebo periods. There were 9 of 66 patients on P, 9 of 46 on beta-blockers, 4 of 65 on calcium-blocking drugs, 4 of 65 on diuretic, and 1 of 62 patients on ACE inhibitors who did not progress to the higher dose because of side effects. Decreases in SBP compared to randomized placebo were calcium-blocking drugs 15 mm Hg = diuretic 13 mm Hg > ACE inhibitors 8 mm Hg = beta-blockers 5 mm Hg. Blood pressure decrease correlated with placebo BP (P < .0005, r = 0.53 to 0.70). When corrected for placebo, target SBP (<140 mm Hg) was reached in between 6% to 15% of patients on monotherapy. Sequential monotherapy achieved target in 29%. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium-blocking drugs, and diuretics had no more side effects than placebo. Patients on beta-blockers had more side effects and the well-being score was reduced. Diuretics and calcium-blocking drugs are more effective in elderly patients at lowering SBP pressure. beta-Blockers were relatively ineffective, were frequently contraindicated, and had more side effects. Monotherapy achieved control in only a small number of patients.

Although several randomized clinical trials have compared beta-blockers with placebo for treatment of congestive heart failure, a meta-analysis quantifying the effect on mortality and morbidity has not been performed recently.; The MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Web of Science electronic databases were searched from 1966 to July 2000. References were also identified from bibliographies of pertinent articles.; All randomized clinical trials of beta-blockers versus placebo in chronic stable congestive heart failure were included.; A specified protocol was followed to extract data on patient characteristics, beta-blocker used, overall mortality, hospitalizations for congestive heart failure, and study quality.; A hierarchical random-effects model was used to synthesize the results. A total of 22 trials involving 10 135 patients were identified. There were 624 deaths among 4862 patients randomly assigned to placebo and 444 deaths among 5273 patients assigned to beta-blocker therapy. In these groups, 754 and 540 patients, respectively, required hospitalization for congestive heart failure. The probability that beta-blocker therapy reduced total mortality and hospitalizations for congestive heart failure was almost 100%. The best estimates of these advantages are 3.8 lives saved and 4 fewer hospitalizations per 100 patients treated in the first year after therapy. The probability that these benefits are clinically significant (>2 lives saved or >2 fewer hospitalizations per 100 patients treated) is 99%. Both selective and nonselective agents produced these salutary effects. The results are robust to any reasonable publication bias.; beta-Blocker therapy is associated with clinically meaningful reductions in mortality and morbidity in patients with stable congestive heart failure and should be routinely offered to all patients similar to those included in trials.",I,8

We performed a meta-analysis of the trials, as identified by electronic database searching and cross-referencing. Both investigators independently applied inclusion and exclusion criteria, and abstracted data from each trial. Standard meta-analytic techniques were used to compute relative risks and the number needed to treat (NNT) for first variceal bleed, bleed-related mortality, and all-cause mortality. Among 601 patients in 5 homogeneous trials comparing prophylactic ligation with untreated controls, relative risks of first variceal bleed, bleed-related mortality, and all-cause mortality were 0.36 (0.26-0.50), 0.20 (0.11-0.39), and 0.55 (0.43-0.71), with respective NNTs of 4.1, 6.7, and 5.3. Among 283 subjects from 4 trials comparing ligation with beta-blocker therapy, the relative risk of first variceal bleed was 0.48 (0.24-0.96), with NNT of 13; however, there was no effect on either bleed-related mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.61; confidence interval [CI], 0.20-1.88) or all-cause mortality (RR, 0.95; CI, 0.56-1.62). In conclusion, compared with untreated controls, prophylactic ligation reduces the risks of variceal bleeding and mortality. Compared with beta-blockers, ligation reduces the risk for first variceal bleed but has no effect on mortality. Prophylactic ligation should be considered for patients with large esophageal varices who cannot tolerate beta-blockers. Subsequent research should further compare ligation and beta-blockers to determine the effect on mortality, and measure ligation's cost-effectiveness.",I,E

The long-term renal effects of calcium-channel blockers remain unclear.; To compare the changes in renal function in 2,258 treated and 2,148 untreated patients with isolated systolic hypertension, of whom 455 had diabetes mellitus and 390 had proteinuria.; We performed a post-hoc analysis of the double-blind placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Trial. Active treatment was initiated with nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), or both, titrated or combined to reduce the sitting systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mmHg, to less than 150 mmHg. The main outcome measures were serum creatinine concentration and creatinine clearance calculated by the formula of Cockroft and Gault.; Serum creatinine concentration at the time when participants were randomly allocated to study groups was less than 176.8 micromol/l (2.0 mg/dl), averaging 88 micromol/l. At the time of the last serum creatinine measurement, the blood pressure difference (P< 0.001) between the two groups was 11.6/4.1 mmHg. In the intention-to-treat analysis (11,427 patient-years), serum creatinine and the calculated creatinine clearance were not influenced by active treatment. However, in the patients assigned randomly to receive active treatment, the incidence of mild renal dysfunction (serum creatinine at least 176.8 mmol/l) decreased by 64% (P= 0.04) and that of proteinuria by 33% (P= 0.03). Active treatment reduced the risk of proteinuria more in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients: by 71%, compared with 20% (P= 0.04). In non-proteinuric patients, active treatment did not influence serum creatinine, whereas in patients with proteinuria at entry to the study, serum creatinine decreased on active treatment (P< 0.001). Furthermore, in on-randomized treatment comparison stratified for risk at baseline, serum creatinine concentration did not change (P= 0.98) in patients continuing to receive monotherapy with nitrendipine, whereas it increased by 6.73 mmol/l (P < 0.001) in patients who received hydrochlorothiazide alone or in combination with other study medication (P < 0.001 for difference in trends).; In older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive treatment starting with the dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, nitrendipine, did not decrease blood pressure at the expense of renal function and prevented the development of proteinuria, especially in diabetic patients.",E,E

Although current antihypertensive treatment regimens reduce morbidity and mortality, patients are often noncompliant, and medications may not completely normalize blood pressure. As a result, current therapy frequently does not prevent or reverse the cardiovascular remodeling that often occurs when blood pressure is chronically elevated. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is effective in controlling hypertension and treating congestive heart failure. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibit the activity of the RAS, but these two classes of antihypertensive medications have different mechanisms of action and different pharmacologic profiles. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors block a single pathway in the production of angiotensin II (Ang II). In addition, angiotensin I is not the only substrate for ACE. The ACE inhibitors also block the degradation of bradykinin that may have potential benefits in cardiovascular disease. Bradykinin is, however, the presumed cause of cough associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. Data from clinical trials on ACE inhibitors serve to support the involvement of the RAS in the development of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin receptor blockers act distally in the RAS to block the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor selectively. Thus, ARBs are more specific agents and avoid many side effects. Experimental and clinical trials have documented the efficacy of ARBs in preserving target-organ function and reversing cardiovascular remodeling. In some instances, maximal benefit may be obtained with Ang II blockade using both ARBs and ACE inhibitors. This review describes clinical trials that document the efficacy of ARBs in protecting the myocardium, blood vessels, and renal vasculature.",E,E

At lower doses, the metabolic effects of thiazide diuretics are minimal and probably without clinical significance, and the risk of developing diabetes mellitus type 2 does not seem to be increased.; The cheaper thiazide diuretics are still valuable drugs in the treatment of hypertension.

With respect to medical therapy, betablockers are practically without deleterious effects and are effective in diabetic populations. The same is true of other antianginal drugs. Conventional coronary angioplasty is associated with poorer results than the general population in the long-term, partly because of progression of the coronary artery disease and partly because of an increased incidence of restenosis. The use of stents improves these results, which are similar to those of the general population with single vessel disease or those without proteinuria. Coronary bypass surgery, despite a certain perioperative morbidity, is associated with an identical survival rate at 5 years as non-diabetics, providing the internal mammary artery is grafted. The comparison between these methods is resumed in the ACIP study which opposes the 3 strategies, in Morris et al's study comparing medical and surgical approaches and, finally, in the recent BARI trial where patients were randomly allocated to angioplasty or surgery. It would appear that the surgical strategy gives better results in multivessel disease. However, many reserves have been voiced because of the small numbers of patients, the high number of excluded patients and the fact that recent progress in angioplasty with widespread use of stenting associated with the prescription of new antiaggregant drugs was not taken into account.",1,E

Patients were treated by ultrafiltration and conventional antihypertensive drugs and BPs were repeated at three years in the 32 survivors.; 93% of the patients (39/42) were African-American. At inception, 85% of the patients were hypertensive with BPs of 154 +/- 23/83 +/- 14 mmHg and 137 +/- 22/74 +/- 14 mmHg pre- and post-dialysis, respectively. The response to ultrafiltration was dependent upon gender, with women having a greater BP reduction compared to men. At three-year follow-up, the BP had dropped significantly in the survivors a mean of 9.4/6.7 mmHg. Pre- and post-dialysis weights, post dialysis BP and interdialytic weight-gain were unchanged. The BP reduction was achieved by an increase in the number of antihypertensive medications from 0.91 +/- 0.86 medications to 1.41 +/- 1.16. Improved BP control did not worsen the efficiency of dialysis (Kt/V). The use of beta-blockers doubled during the period of follow-up.

Conventional treatment for these debilitating conditions routinely involves the use of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are nonspecific inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2. Numerous studies suggest that inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by NSAIDs is deleterious to kidney function, particularly in high-risk patients. As celecoxib inhibits COX-2 and spares COX-1 at therapeutic doses, we hypothesized that it may offer an improved renal safety profile in patients at risk for NSAID-induced renal toxicity. This article represents a post hoc analysis of the renal safety of celecoxib, using the safety database generated during its clinical development program. This analysis includes data from more than 50 clinical studies involving more than 13,000 subjects. Most subjects were enrolled in randomized, controlled trials (of up to 12 weeks' duration); however, more than 5000 subjects received celecoxib for as long as 2 years in a long-term, open-label study at as much as twice the maximum recommended dosage. The overall incidence of renal adverse events after celecoxib was greater than that after placebo but similar to that after NSAIDs. The most common events reported after celecoxib, namely, peripheral edema (2.1%), hypertension (0.8%), and exacerbation of preexisting hypertension (0.6%), were not time- or dose-related. Peripheral edema was not associated with increased weight or blood pressure. Furthermore, there was no evidence of drug-drug interactions between celecoxib and concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics. We conclude that celecoxib is well tolerated by patients who may be at risk for NSAID-induced renal toxicity, such as the elderly and those with hypertension or preexisting chronic heart disease.",E,E

However, in several diseases or conditions such as the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of AVP (SIADH), congestive heart failure, arterial hypertension, liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, dysmenorrhoea and ocular hypertension, AVP may play an important role in their pathophysiology. Recently, orally-active non-peptide AVP receptor antagonists were developed by random screening of chemical entities and optimisation of lead compounds. These include agents specific for the V(1)-vascular and V(2)-renal AVP receptor subtypes. Dual V(1)/V(2) AVP receptor antagonists are also being studied. Some of these non-peptide receptor antagonists have been studied extensively, while others are currently under investigation. Potential therapeutic indications for AVP receptor antagonists comprise: 1) The blockade of V(1)-vascular AVP receptors in arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, Raynaud's syndrome, peripheral vascular disease and dysmenorrhea. 2) The blockade of V(2)-renal AVP receptors in the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of vasopressin, congestive hart failure, liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome and any state of excessive retention of free water and subsequent dilutional hyponatraemia. 3) The blockade of V(3)-pituitary AVP receptors in ACTH-secreting tumours.

Beta-blockers are effective antihypertensive agents which, in long term studies, have proven beneficial in reducing important clinical end-points. However nonselective beta-blockers may have a negative effect on lipid profiles and contribute to hypoglycaemic unawareness, thus preventing their use in some patients with diabetes mellitus. The development of newer and more selective beta-blockers has overcome many of these problems. In addition, some of the newer agents have novel properties such as release of nitric oxide, which theoretically would make them more attractive in patients with diabetes mellitus. Overall, the adverse metabolic effects of beta-blockers do not appear to be important in clinical practice and these agents should no longer be contraindicated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Their proven cardiovascular benefits would seem to easily tip the balance in favour of their use.",5,E

However, patients with profound neurohumoral abnormalities derive little survival benefit from beta-blockers. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of beta-blockers on heart rate variability (HRV) in decompensated CHF.; Time and frequency domain HRV indices were obtained from 24-hour Holter recordings and compared to assess the role of beta-blockade in 199 patients (mean age 60 +/- 14 years) with decompensated CHF. Neurohormonal differences were assessed by measuring norepinephrine, endothelin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 in a subset of 64 patients.; All HRV indices were markedly suppressed but were substantially higher in patients who were on beta-blockers. Time domain measures of parasympathetic cardiac activity, the percentage of R-R intervals with > 50 ms variation (4.9 +/- 0.6 vs 7.7 +/- 1.2%, P = 0.006) and the square root of mean squared differences of successive R-R intervals (22.7 +/- 2.0 vs 31.6 +/- 4.1 ms, P = 0.004), were higher in the beta-blocker group. Spectral analysis revealed that the total power and the ultra-low frequency power were significantly higher in patients on beta-blockers (82% and 59%, respectively). The high frequency power, a spectral index of parasympathetic modulation, was 41% higher in the beta-blocker group (121 +/- 25 vs 171 +/- 27 ms(2), P = 0.02). Norepinephrine and interleukin-6 levels were substantially lower in patients on beta-blockers (28% and 61%, respectively). However, these differences did not reach statistical significance.; Beta-blockers improve the impaired cardiac autonomic regulation during high sympathetic stress of decompensated CHF. This effect may play an important role in protecting the myocardium and preventing arrhythmias during transient increases in sympathetic activity.",E,E

Recent sub-group analysis of the Goteborg Metoprolol Trial and the AIRE study confirm that patients receiving beta-blockers in the setting of post-MI heart failure fare better than patients not receiving this therapy. For all these reasons the CAPRICORN trial of carvedilol in post-MI LV dysfunction was an important and eagerly awaited trial. The results were presented for the first time at The American College of Cardiology on March 20 2001. CAPRICORN randomised 984 patients to placebo and 975 to carvedilol between 3 and 21 days (mean 10) after a confirmed MI. Patients had to have evidence of a left ventricular ejection fraction 40% or less. All patients had received ACEI therapy for at least 48 hours prior to randomisation. The mean ejection fraction of the patients recruited was 32.7% in the placebo group and 32.9% in the carvedilol group. Follow-up was for a mean of 15 months (maximum 2.7 years). All cause mortality was 15.3% (151 deaths) in the placebo group and 11.9% (116 deaths) in the carvedilol group, giving a hazard ratio of 0.77 (0.60-0.98) and a significance of p = 0.031. And yet this agent will probably not be given a licence for this indication in the European Union and the USA. The reason is one of trial design and statistical declarations. Some way into the trial the Steering Committee decided to change the primary end-point form all-cause mortality to two co-primary end-points and to allocate their alpha power of 0.05 unevenly between the combined end-points of all cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalisation (alpha 0.045) and all cause mortality (alpha 0.005). In the end neither was achieved, one because of the large number of non-specific hospitalisations for chest pain and the mortality effect because it was allocated a punitive and unachievable target of p < 0.005. The trial is thus officially neutral despite showing convincing clinical benefit. Clearly arcane matters of statistical plans do matter and steering committees should think very carefully before changing the primary end-points of major trials.",I,8

Generally, the patients recruited to these trials were at low risk: few had heart failure, and none had measurements of left-ventricular function taken. We investigated the long-term efficacy of carvedilol on morbidity and mortality in patients with left-ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction treated according to current evidence-based practice.; In a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, 1959 patients with a proven acute myocardial infarction and a left-ventricular ejection fraction of </=40% were randomly assigned 6.25 mg carvedilol (n=975) or placebo (n=984). Study medication was progressively increased to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily during the next 4-6 weeks, and patients were followed up until the requisite number of primary endpoints had occurred. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality or hospital admission for cardiovascular problems. Analysis was by intention to treat.; Although there was no difference between the carvedilol and placebo groups in the number of patients with the primary endpoint (340 [35%] vs 367 [37%], hazard ratio 0.92 [95% CI 0.80-1.07]), all-cause mortality alone was lower in the carvedilol group than in the placebo group (116 [12%] vs 151 [15%], 0.77 [0.60-0.98], p=0.03). Cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and all-cause mortality or non-fatal myocardial infarction were also lower on carvedilol than on placebo.; In patients treated long-term after an acute myocardial infarction complicated by left-ventricular systolic dysfunction, carvedilol reduced the frequency of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and recurrent, non-fatal myocardial infarctions.

Data from Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS), with a 35% mortality reduction, extended this benefit to class IV patients treated with carvedilol who do not require intravenous diuretics or positive inotropes. Ongoing beta-blocker studies address new topics, such as treatment of older patients, in whom diastolic heart failure may be more common, and direct comparison of different drugs.

Administration of metoprolol has been shown to cause up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor density and to decrease nocturnal melatonin release, whereas carvedilol lacks these typical effects of beta-blocking drugs.; To compare beta-blocking effects of metoprolol and carvedilol when applied orally in healthy subjects.; We investigated the effects of single oral doses of clinically recommended amounts of metoprolol (50, 100 and 200 mg) and carvedilol (25, 50 and 100 mg) to those of a placebo in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over study in 12 healthy male volunteers. Two hours after oral administration of the drugs heart rate and blood pressure were measured at rest, after 10 min of exercise, and after 15 min of recovery.; Metoprolol tended to decrease heart rate during exercise (-21%, -25% and -24%) to a greater extent than carvedilol (-16%, -16% and -18%). At rest, increasing doses of metoprolol caused decreasing heart rates (62, 60 and 58 beats/min) whereas increasing doses of carvedilol caused increasing heart rates (62, 66 and 69 beats/min), 50 and 100 mg carvedilol failed to differ significantly from the placebo (71 beats/min).; We conclude that clinically recommended doses of carvedilol cause a clinically relevant beta-blockade in humans predominantly during exercise where it appears to be slightly (although not significantly) less effective than metoprolol. On the other hand, the effects of carvedilol on heart rate at rest appear rather weak, particularly in subjects with a low sympathetic tone. This might be caused by a reflex increase on sympathetic drive secondary to peripheral vasodilation resulting from the alpha-blocking effects of the drug. These results might be helpful in explaining why carvedilol, in contrast to metoprolol, may fail to cause up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor density and does not decrease nocturnal melatonin release. This, in turn, may be a reason for the weak side-effects of carvedilol resulting from the beta-blockade. In addition, our data might be of interest in the interpretation of the forthcoming results of the COMET trial, although it has to be emphasised that they were derived from healthy subjects and, therefore, cannot be directly extrapolated to patients with heart failure.",E,E

Several randomised trials have evaluated the effects of beta blockers in heart failure. This paper gives a systematic overview of published randomised trials of beta blockers in heart failure using standard methods. In all, 22 randomised controlled trials were identified with a total of 10480 patients, and an average of 11 months of treatment. The average age was 61 years and 4% were female. Most studies excluded patients with severe heart failure. Death rates in patients randomised to receive beta blockers compared to controls were 458/5657 (8.0%) and 635/4951 (12.8%) respectively, odds ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.55-0.72, P<0.00001.

These results show that beta blockers reduce the risk of mortality or the need for heart-failure hospital admission by approximately one third. Absolute reductions of 5-6% in event rates were observed over approximately 1 year of treatment period. These important benefits should be implemented as a priority, since treatment with beta blockers is inexpensive and heart failure carries a high risk of death and disability.

Discounted LYG were calculated to be 0.228 under the limited benefits scenario and 0.368 under the extended benefits scenario. Under the extended benefits scenario shared care resulted in a cost of pound268 per LYG or pound412 per LYG for community initiation. Under the limited benefits scenario the costs were a pound135 saving and pound69, respectively.; This analysis has shown bisoprolol to be an economically attractive therapy in comparison with other treatments.

Clinical studies of particular interest to physicians with an interest in heart failure and its prevention are reviewed. The COPERNICUS trial lends further support to the use of the beta-blocker, carvedilol, in severe heart failure and the CAPRICORN trial to its use in patients with post-infarction left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The MIRACLE study reinforces the evidence from three smaller trials that cardiac resynchronisation therapy is an effective treatment for the relief of symptoms in patients with severe heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony. The STAF trial casts further doubt on the wisdom of cardioversion as a routine strategy for the management of chronic atrial fibrillation. The RITZ-2 trial suggests that an intravenous, non-selective endothelin antagonist is effective in improving haemodynamics and symptoms and possibly in reducing morbidity in severe heart failure. Observational studies in heart failure suggest that a moderate excess of body fat and elevated blood cholesterol may be desirable in patients with heart failure, challenging the current non-evidenced-based vogue for cholesterol lowering therapy in heart failure. The RENAISSANCE and RECOVER outcome studies of etanercept, a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor analogue that blocks the effect of TNF, were stopped because of lack of evidence of benefit shortly after the ACC.",I,8

In the elderly, systolic hypertension is a major modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Systolic blood pressure is associated with higher risk of an adverse outcome, whereas diastolic blood pressure is inversely correlated with total mortality, independent of systolic blood pressure, highlighting the role of pulse pressure as risk factor. Three placebo-controlled outcome trials on antihypertensive drug treatment in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension have been published: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP), the Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Trial and the Systolic Hypertension in China (Syst-China) Trial. These three trials demonstrated the benefit of antihypertensive drug treatment. A meta-analysis was performed by pooling the patients from these three trials with a subset of patients with isolated systolic hypertension from five other trials in the elderly. Antihypertensive treatment based on a calcium-channel blocker may provide additional benefits in diabetic patients and in the prevention of dementia and renal dysfunction. The pooled results of 15693 older patients with isolated systolic hypertension prove that antihypertensive drug treatment is justified if on repeated clinic measurements systolic blood pressure is 160 mmHg or higher.",E,E

The aim of this prospective, controlled, and randomized study was to compare conventional sclerotherapy with injection of the tissue adhesive N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate in controlling the first episode of rupturing of esophageal varices.; From January 1994 to June 1997, 36 consecutive Child-Pugh class C cirrhotic patients were admitted with an initial episode of esophageal variceal bleeding. They were randomly assigned to receive sclerotherapy with a 3% ethanolamine oleate solution (group 1, 18 patients) or injection of tissue adhesive (group 2, 18 patients). Episodes of recurrent bleeding were managed after the randomization procedure. After bleeding had been controlled, patients in both groups received weekly sessions of conventional sclerotherapy to eradicate any remaining esophageal veins.; The patients in the two treatment groups had similar characteristics on entry into the study. More than 80% of the patients were admitted with moderate or severe hemorrhage. Approximately half of them presented with active bleeding during the index endoscopy. Early recurrent bleeding was observed in ten of the 18 patients in group 1 (55.6%) and in two of the 18 in group 2 (11.1%; P = 0.01).

However, patients with profound neurohumoral abnormalities derive little survival benefit from beta-blockers. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of beta-blockers on heart rate variability in decompensated heart failure.; Time and frequency domain heart rate variability indices were obtained from 24-h Holter recordings and compared to assess the role of beta-blockade in 199 patients (mean age 60+/-14 years [range 21 to 87]) with decompensated heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class III [66%] and IV [34%]).; All heart rate variability indices were markedly suppressed but were substantially higher in patients who were on beta-blockers. Time domain measures of parasympathetic cardiac activity, the percentage of RR intervals with >50 ms variation (4.9+/-0.6 vs. 7.7+/-1.2%, P=0.006) and the square root of mean squared differences of successive RR intervals (22.7+/-2.0 vs. 31.6+/-4.1 ms, P=0.004), were higher in the beta-blocker group. Spectral analysis revealed that the total power and the ultra low frequency power were significantly higher in patients on beta-blockers (82% and 59%, respectively). The high frequency power, a spectral index of parasympathetic modulation, was 41% higher in the beta-blocker group (121+/-25 vs. 171+/-27 ms(2), P=0.02). Multiple linear regression, adjusted for clinical parameters and drug therapies, revealed a strong positive relationship between beta-blockade and higher values of time and frequency domain measures. The mean number of ventricular tachycardia episodes were significantly lower in patients on beta-blocker therapy (3.6+/-1.5 vs. 19.0+/-5.3, P=0.04).; beta-blockers improve the impaired cardiac autonomic regulation during high sympathetic stress of decompensated heart failure.",E,E

Using evidence-based medicine and consensus, this report updates contemporary approaches to hypertension control during pregnancy by expanding on recommendations made in the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI). The recommendations to use K5 for determining diastolic pressure and to eliminate edema as a criterion for diagnosing pre-eclampsia are discussed. In addition, the use of blood pressure increases of 30 mm Hg systolic or 15 mm Hg diastolic as a diagnostic criterion has not been recommended, as available evidence shows that women in this group are not likely to suffer increased adverse outcomes. Management considerations are made between chronic hypertension that is present before pregnancy and those occurring as part of the pregnancy-specific condition preeclampsia, as well as management considerations in women with comorbid conditions. A discussion of the pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in pregnancy includes recommendations for specific agents. The use of low-dose aspirin, calcium, or other dietary supplements in the prevention of pre-eclampsia is described, and expanded sections on counseling women for future pregnancies and recommendations for future research are included.

However, because persons with cardiovascular or respiratory diseases were generally excluded from many of these early studies, the risk of serious cardiovascular and respiratory side effects was seriously underestimated. Once these drugs were made available to the general population, reports of systemic side effects began to proliferate. Very quickly, adverse effects from topical beta blockade became ""old news."" Despite this recognition, many treating physicians remained unaware of the potential for systemic beta blockade from topically applied beta blockers. A significant portion of a topically administered dose of a beta blocker can be absorbed and thereby affect systemic beta blockade. Sensitivity to systemic beta blockade can be quite dramatic in certain highly susceptible patients, particularly those with either cardiac or pulmonary abnormalities.

In total 270 (51 male and 219 female) patients, aged 18-65 years, suffering between two and six migraine attacks per month were recruited. The main objective was to show equivalence with respect to efficacy, defined as a 50% reduction in the rate of migraine attacks. A run-in phase was carried out with placebo for 4 weeks, followed by a 16-week drug phase. In both treatment groups the median frequency of migraine attacks improved during the study period, from three to two in the ASA group and from three to one in the metoprolol group; 45.2% of all metoprolol patients were responders compared with 29.6% with ASA. Medication-related adverse events were less frequent in the ASA group (37) than in the metoprolol group (73). The findings from this trial show that metoprolol is superior to ASA for migraine prophylaxis but has more side-effects. Acetylsalicylic acid is better tolerated than metoprolol. Using a strict responder criterion ASA showed a responder rate comparable with the placebo rate in the literature.",I,E
11423055,Comparison of the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with acutely decompensated congestive heart failure receiving dobutamine versus nesiritide therapy.,"Aged; Atrial Natriuretic Factor; Cardiotonic Agents; Dobutamine; Double-Blind Method; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Statistics, Nonparametric; Tachycardia, Ventricular; Treatment Outcome","Burger, A J; Elkayam, U; Neibaur, M T; Haught, H; Ghali, J; Horton, D P; Aronson, D","Ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and may be exacerbated by positive inotropic therapy. Because human B-type natriuretic peptide (nesiritide), an arterial and venodilator, inhibits sympathetic activity, it may decrease the incidence of arrhythmias. Our investigation compares the arrhythmogenicity of dobutamine with nesiritide. A total of 305 patients with decompensated CHF requiring intravenous vasoactive therapy were randomized to receive standard therapy (n = 102) or nesiritide (0.015 microg/kg/min [n = 103] or 0.030 microg/kg/min [n = 100]) to gain additional data on the relative safety and efficacy of nesiritide compared with standard parenteral care. Dobutamine was chosen as the standard care agent in 58 subjects. During study drug infusion, all patients had continuous clinical hemodynamic and electrocardiographic monitoring. The dobutamine and nesiritide groups were similar with respect to baseline use of antiarrhythmic agents, including beta blockers. Serious arrhythmias and the incidence of cardiac arrest were more common in patients who received dobutamine than in those taking nesiritide: sustained ventricular tachycardia, 4 (7%) versus 2 (1%), respectively (p = 0.014); nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, 10 (17%) versus 23 (11%), respectively (p = 0.029); cardiac arrest, 3 (5%) versus 0, respectively (p = 0.011). We conclude that among patients with decompensated CHF for whom dobutamine is selected as standard therapy, the incidence of serious ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest is significantly greater than the incidence of these events in patients randomized to nesiritide.",E,E

The aim of the present study was to compare results of quantitative technetium-99-sestamibi single photon emission tomography (SPECT), following exercise stress test or pharmacological stress test with adenosine. We chose adenosine as comparison, since betablockers may not interfere with adenosine induced vasodilatation and therefore possibly may not interfere with its diagnostic performance. Sixteen patients with angiographically documented coronary disease (5 single-vessel, 6 two-vessel and 5 three-vessel disease), who were chronically treated with beta-blockers, performed SPECT imaging at rest, following bicycle exercise and following adenosine infusion in random order. The SPECT data were analyzed visually and quantitatively, using dedicated computer software (CEqual). According to both visual and quantitative SPECT analysis, adenosine was superior to show reversibility. Higher reversibility extent (50 +/- 15 vs. 26 +/- 12 pixels, p < 0.01) and more intense reversibility severity (110 +/- 29 vs. 49 +/- 23 sum of SDs, p < 0.05) were observed during adenosine than exercise.; Less myocardial perfusion abnormalities during exercise than during adenosine stress in patients treated with beta-blockers may indicate less ischemia but also an impaired diagnostic performance. Thus adenosine stress test should be preferred to optimize the diagnostic sensitivity in patients during beta-blocker treatment.",E,E

We report a prospectively planned economic analysis of the cost of adjunctive beta-blocker therapy in the second Cardiac Insufficiency BIsoprolol Study (CIBIS II).; Resource utilization data (drug therapy, number of hospital admissions, length of hospital stay, ward type) were collected prospectively in all patients in CIBIS II. These data were used to determine the additional direct costs incurred, and savings made, with bisoprolol therapy. As well as the cost of the drug, additional costs related to bisoprolol therapy were added to cover the supervision of treatment initiation and titration (four outpatient clinic/office visits). Per diem (hospital bed day) costings were carried out for France, Germany and the U.K. Diagnosis related group costings were performed for France and the U.K. Our analyses took the perspective of a third party payer in France and Germany and the National Health Service in the U.K.; Overall, fewer patients were hospitalized in the bisoprolol group, there were fewer hospital admissions per patient hospitalized, fewer hospital admissions overall, fewer days spent in hospital and fewer days spent in the most expensive type of ward. As a consequence the cost of care in the bisoprolol group was 5-10% less in all three countries, in the per diem analysis, even taking into account the cost of bisoprolol and the extra initiation/up-titration visits. The cost per patient treated in the placebo and bisoprolol groups was FF35 009 vs FF31 762 in France, DM11 563 vs DM10 784 in Germany and pound4987 vs pound4722 in the U.K. The diagnosis related group analysis gave similar results.; Not only did bisoprolol increase survival and reduce hospital admissions in CIBIS II, it also cut the cost of care in so doing. This 'win-win' situation of positive health benefits associated with cost savings is favourable from the point of view of both the patient and health care systems. These findings add further support for the use of beta-blockers in chronic heart failure.",E,E

It is available in a modified-release formulation which has a gradual onset of action and is effective in a single daily oral dose of 10 to 20 mg. Bamidipine has selective action against cardiovascular calcium antagonist receptors and its antihypertensive action is related to the reduction of peripheral vascular resistance secondary to its vasodilatory action. The clinical antihypertensive efficacy of barnidipine is similar to that of other DHP calcium antagonists such as nitrendipine and amlodipine, and antihypertensives belonging to other drug classes such as atenolol and enalapril. Barnidipine has been found to be as efficacious and well tolerated as hydrochlorothiazide in the management of hypertension in elderly patients. Barnidipine is generally well tolerated. As with other DHP calcium antagonists, vasodilator adverse events such as headache, flushing and peripheral oedema account for most of the adverse events reported with its use and are usually transient. Oedema is less frequent than with amlodipine and nitrendipine. Its use is not associated with reflex tachycardia.",E,E

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) events were validated and followed for 3-year all-cause mortality. Between 1985 and 1997, age-adjusted CHD mortality rates in Minneapolis/St Paul fell 47% and 51% in men and women, respectively; the comparable declines in US whites were 34% and 29%. In-hospital mortality declined faster than out-of-hospital mortality. The rate of AMI (ICD-9 code 410) hospital discharges declined almost 20% between 1985 and 1995, whereas the discharge rate for unstable angina (ICD-9 code 411) increased substantially. The incidence of hospitalized definite AMI declined approximately 10%, whereas recurrence rates fell 20% to 30%.

Patients with frequent attacks may also receive propranolol or other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists for migraine prophylaxis. The present studies investigated the potential for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between beta-adrenoceptor blockers and rizatriptan.; Four double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover investigations were performed in a total of 51 healthy subjects. A single 10 mg dose of rizatriptan was administered after 7 days' administration of propranolol (60 and 120 mg twice daily), nadolol (80 mg twice daily), metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) or placebo. Rizatriptan pharmacokinetics were assessed. In vitro incubations of rizatriptan and sumatriptan with various beta-adrenoceptor blockers were performed in human S9 fraction. Production of the indole-acetic acid-MAO-A metabolite of each triptan was measured.; Administration of rizatriptan during propranolol treatment (120 mg twice daily for 7.5 days) increased the AUC(0, infinity) for rizatriptan by approximately 67% and the Cmax by approximately 75%. A reduction in the dose of propranolol (60 mg twice daily) and/or the incorporation of a delay (1 or 2 h) between propranolol and rizatriptan administration did not produce a statistically significant change in the effect of propranolol on rizatriptan pharmacokinetics. Administration of rizatriptan together with nadolol (80 mg twice daily) or metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) for 7 days did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan. No untoward adverse experiences attributable to the pharmacokinetic interaction between propranolol and rizatriptan were observed, and no subjects developed serious clinical, laboratory, or other significant adverse experiences during coadministration of rizatriptan with any of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers. In vitro incubations showed that propranolol, but not other beta-adrenoceptor blockers significantly inhibited the production of the indole-acetic acid metabolite of rizatriptan and sumatriptan.; These results suggest that propranolol increases plasma concentrations of rizatriptan by inhibiting monoamine oxidase-A. When prescribing rizatriptan to migraine patients receiving propranolol for prophylaxis, the 5 mg dose of rizatriptan is recommended. Administration with other beta-adrenoceptor blockers does not require consideration of a dose adjustment.",E,E

To evaluate the effect of antihypertensive treatment on cardiac arrhythmias (CA) and transient episodes of myocardial ischemia (TEMI), we studied 46 hypertensive patients with LVH, divided into four groups randomly treated with enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), atenolol, or verapamil (SR-V) for 6 months. Office blood pressure and office heart rate values were recorded, in basal conditions, after 1 and 6 months of treatment, and all patients underwent echocardiography, electrocardiographic Holter monitoring, and stress testing. All drugs significantly lowered blood pressure, whereas left ventricular mass index was reduced by atenolol, enalapril, and SR-V, but not by HCTZ. Treatment induced a significant reduction in the number of patients with supraventricular arrhythmias (35 v 15, P < .034, and 28 v 8, excluding patients treated with HCTZ, P < .008). The number of patients with ventricular arrhythmias was also reduced (32 v 16 considering all groups, P < .08, and 24 v 9, excluding patients treated with HCTZ, P < .04). The number of TEMI during Holter monitoring significantly decreased from 47 to 23 (P = .043) in all patients, and from 39 to 14 (P = .013) excluding patients treated with HCTZ. In all groups, irrespective of treatment, a reduction of blood pressure, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure/heart rate product measured by exercise stress test was observed. The present study shows that in hypertensive patients with LVH, antihypertensive treatment with atenolol, enalapril and SR-V reduces LVH and decreases the prevalence of CA and TEMI. Treatment with HCTZ during the 6-month study did not alter LVH and did not appear to reduce CA and TEMI.",I,E

Thirteen obese, hypertensive patients with a body mass index (BMI) > or =28 kg/m2 (obese) and nine lean patients with a BMI < or =25 kg/m2 (lean) were recruited. After a 1-week washout period, participants underwent daytime ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Participants were then treated with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist doxazosin, titrating to 4 mg QHS in 1 week. In the next week, the beta-adrenergic antagonist atenolol was added at an initial dose of 25 mg/day and titrated to 50 mg/day within 1 week. One month after the addition of atenolol, all patients underwent a second ABPM session. There were no differences between the obese and lean subjects in baseline systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), or mean arterial pressures (MAP) measured by office recording or ABPM. However, obese subjects had higher heart rates than lean subjects (87.5+/-2.4 v 76.8+/-4.9 beats/min). After 1 month of treatment with the adrenergic blockers, obese patients had a significantly lower SBP (130.0+/-2.5 v 138.9+/-2.1 mm Hg, P = .02) and MAP (99.6+/-2.3 v 107.0+/-1.5 mm Hg, P = .02) than lean patients. Obese patients also tended to have a lower DBP than lean patients (84.3+/-2.5 v 90.9+/-1.6 mm Hg, P = .057), but there was no significant difference in heart rate after 1 month of adrenergic blockade. These results indicate that blood pressure is more sensitive to adrenergic blockade in obese than in lean hypertensive patients and suggest that increased sympathetic activity may be an important factor in the maintenance of hypertension in obesity.",E,E

Combination therapy aims to improve overall therapeutic efficacy while minimising adverse effects. In well-designed multicentre clinical trials, perindopril/indapamide at doses ranging from 2/0.625 to 8/2.5 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving adequate blood pressure (BP) control. A similar reduction in supine BP was observed when combined perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day was compared with losartan 50 mg/day or atenolol 50 mg/day. Similar reductions in 24-hour ambulatory BP were also seen with perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day and irbesartan 150 mg/day. However, response and normalisation rates were significantly higher with combination therapy than with losartan or irbesartan monotherapy. Combined perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day therapy effectively reduced BP in elderly patients aged 65 to 85 years to a significantly greater extent than either atenolol 50 mg/day or placebo. Supine BP was also normalised in approximately two-thirds of patients in a small noncomparative trial in patients with hypertension and renal impairment. Low-dose perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day was well tolerated in clinical trials; the most common adverse events were headache and cough. Hypokalaemia, associated with the use of diuretics, occurred with a higher incidence with combined perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day therapy than with either atenolol 50 mg/day or placebo. Perindopril/indapamide 2/0.625 mg/day has shown efficacy in well designed comparative trials with atenolol, losartan and irbesartan including elderly patients and patients with renal impairment. Studies comparing this dosage of perindopril/ indapamide with other combination therapies would be beneficial in allowing the place of perindopril/indapamide to be more accurately determined. The fixed-low dose combination of perindopril/indapamide provides a promising and well tolerated treatment option in the management of patients with mild to moderate hypertension.",E,E

Quality of trials was assessed based on randomisation, masking, and withdrawal. Sensitivity analyses were used to estimate the effects of quality of study on outcomes. The data sources were Medline, Embase, Scientific Citation Index, Merck Glaucoma, and Pharmacia and Upjohn ophthalmology databases. There were 1256 patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension reported in 11 trials of latanoprost versus timolol. The main outcome measures were (i) percentage intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction for efficacy; (ii) relative risk, risk difference, and number needed to harm for side effects such as hyperaemia, conjunctivitis, increased pigmentation, hypotension, and bradycardia expressed as dichotomous outcomes; and (iii) reduction in systemic blood pressure and heart rate as side effects.; Both 0.005% latanoprost once daily and 0.5% timolol twice daily reduced IOP. The percentage reductions in IOP from baseline (mean (SE)) produced by latanoprost and timolol were 30.2 (2.3) and 26.9 (3.4) at 3 months. The difference in IOP reduction between the two treatments were 5.0 (95% confidence intervals 2.8, 7.3). However, latanoprost caused iris pigmentation in more patients than timolol (relative risk = 8.01, 95% confidence intervals 1.87, 34.30). The 2 year risk with latanoprost reached 18% (51/277).

At baseline and 12 months, insulin sensitivity index (MI) was calculated by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic insulin clamp technique.; Blood pressures were reduced similarly in both groups. LVMI (115 +/- 21 g/m2 at baseline) was reduced in both groups (p < 0.01), but more with captopril than with metoprolol (e.g. -16 vs -7 g/m2, i.e. -13 vs -6%, at 12 months, p < 0.01). MI decreased by 6% with captopril (p = 0.05) and by 23% with metoprolol (p < 0.01), with no difference between the groups. Changes in LVMI were not related to changes in MI in the two groups, or when all patients were analyzed together. High-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol decreased (p < 0.05) by both drugs, with small effects on low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides increased by 30% with metoprolol (p < 0.01).; Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has a role beyond that of blood pressure reduction in the regression of LV mass. There was no relationship between regression of LV mass and improvement in insulin sensitivity. We could not confirm a beneficial effect of ACE inhibition on insulin sensitivity.

Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors, initially contra-indicated in heart failure, provide a marked reduction of mortality and morbidity in combination with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as demonstrated in many clinical trials. We performed a review of all clinical trials that compare beta-blockers vs. placebo in chronic heart failure. Beta-blockers with different pharmacological profiles have been tested, mainly metoprolol, bisoprolol, bucindolol and carvedilol. With progressive dose increment, tolerance of such treatment was generally good, left ventricular function improved, hospitalisations for heart failure were less frequent and mortality was reduced. The meta-analysis of the 16 randomised trials, with at least one death in each treatment group, provides a 24% relative risk reduction for such hospitalisations (95% CI=19%-29%) and 22% reduction for mortality (95% CI=16%-28%). Heterogeneity of beta-blocker effect for mortality was found and related to the non-significant benefit obtained in the BEST trial with bucindolol. When such a trial is excluded, the effect model analysis shows that relative risk reduction (beta-blocker induced benefit) is constant whatever the severity of the disease. The mechanism of beta-blocker induced benefit remains unclear, but is at least partly related to left ventricular function improvement and prevention of severe ventricular arrhythmias. In conclusion, beta-blocker treatment has become an established therapy for heart failure, in combination with diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Complementary informations will be needed to clarify the mechanism of benefit and to define the best therapeutic strategy according to the individual characteristics of patients with heart failure.",I,8

Hence, an antihypertensive agent that reverses endothelial dysfunction and lowers blood pressure might improve the prognosis of patients with hypertension. We hypothesized that nebivolol, a vasodilating beta-blocker, could improve endothelial dysfunction. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effects of nebivolol and atenolol on endothelial function.; Twelve hypertensive patients with a mean ambulatory blood pressure of 154+/-7/97+/-10 mm Hg were randomized after a 2-week placebo run-in period (baseline) in a double-blind, crossover fashion to 8-week treatment periods with either 5 mg of nebivolol with 2.5 mg of bendrofluazide or 50 mg of atenolol with 2.5 mg of bendrofluazide. Forearm venous occlusion plethysmography and intra-arterial infusions of acetylcholine and N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) were used to assess stimulated and basal endothelium-dependent nitric oxide release, respectively. Sodium nitroprusside was used as an endothelium-independent control. Nebivolol/bendrofluazide and atenolol/bendrofluazide each lowered the clinic blood pressure to the same extent (132+/-7/82+/-6 and 132+/-9/83+/-8 mm Hg, respectively; P<0.001 from baseline). The vasodilatory response to acetylcholine was significantly increased with nebivolol/bendrofluazide (maximum percentage change in forearm blood flow [mean+/-SEM], 435+/-27%, P<0.001) but not with atenolol/bendrofluazide. Similarly, the endothelium-dependent vasoconstrictive response to L-NMMA was significantly improved only with nebivolol treatment (percentage change in forearm blood flow, -54+/-5%; P<0.001). The response to sodium nitroprusside was not different between treatments, suggesting that the endothelium-independent pathway was unaffected.; Nebivolol/bendrofluazide increased both stimulated and basal endothelial nitric oxide release, whereas for the same degree of blood pressure control, atenolol/bendrofluazide had no effect on nitric oxide bioactivity.

Using data from these trials, we examined the cost-effectiveness of carvedilol in terms of the estimated cost per death averted among patients randomized to such therapy versus those receiving placebo. Attention was focused on the cost of carvediol therapy plus the cost of cardiovascular-related inpatient care. Costs of care were estimated by combining infomation on healthcare utilization from the clinical trials with secondary sources of cost data.; Patients randomized to receive carvedilol had lower mean +/- SD estimated costs of cardiovascular-related inpatient care over 6.5 months compared with those receiving placebo ($1912 +/- $7595 vs. $4463 +/- $20,565, respectively). As mortality alsowas lower among carvedilol patients, the estimated cost per death averted was negative. The probability that carvedilol would both increase survival and decrease costs of cardiovascular-related care over a 6.5-month period was estimated to be 0.98.; Data from the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program indicate that carvedilol reduces mortality in patients with heart failure; our study suggests that it also may be cost-saving over a period of approximately six months.",E,E

After 2 weeks of run-in placebo treatment, 18 patients with coronary artery disease were randomized to a 7-day treatment with either propranolol (40 mg) three times a day or placebo. During run-in and after 7 days of treatment, patients underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring and exercise tests. We analyzed the 24-hour Holter recordings with customized software that computes the correlation between heart rate and occurrence of PVBs. We also computed spectral measures of heart rate variability on the same recordings. Propranolol caused a significant decrease in the log-transformed total number of PVBs recorded over 24 hours and during the day. The number of PVBs was much lower during the night than during the day both after placebo and after propranolol. There were no differences between the two treatments. During the day, there was a positive correlation between heart rate and the number of PVBs in all 18 patients. The mean correlation coefficients between heart rate and number of PVBs increased significantly after propranolol treatment both during the 24-hour monitoring (p < 0.05) and during the day (p < 0.05). The night-recorded correlation coefficients between heart rate and number of PVBs were not significantly different in the placebo versus propranolol group. Propranolol significantly increased the total power during the day. Placebo caused a significant decrease in the low-frequency band (LF) and a significant increase in the high-frequency band (HF) during the night compared with the day. During the day, propranolol significantly reduced LF power and increased HF power, with respect to placebo. After propranolol treatment, the values of LF and HF power during the day were comparable to those recorded at night. The LF/HF ratio decreased significantly after propranolol treatment with respect to placebo in the day and became similar to that recorded during sleep. Propranolol significantly reduced heart rate and systolic blood pressure at rest and at peak exercise and reduced signs of myocardial ischemia. Propranolol administration reduces PVBs in patients with coronary artery disease and severe ventricular arrhythmias possibly through an improvement of cardiac autonomic regulation and through anti-ischemic effects, antiarrhythmic effects, or both.",E,E

On the contrary, propranolol significantly reduced HVPG (-10% +/- 11%, P = 0.003) and cardiac output (-16% +/- 12%, P = 0.001) but did not modify MAP (2.5% +/- 10%, NS). Losartan increased A-II levels, reduced aldosterone, and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in Child B patients. Propranolol did not modify renal function. Adverse events related to therapy were mild and similar in both groups.; Unlike propranolol, long-term losartan administration does not significantly reduce HVPG in patients with cirrhosis treated after a variceal bleeding episode, and it caused hypotension and reduced GFR in patients with moderate liver failure. Therefore, losartan is not an alternative to propranolol in preventing variceal rebleeding.",E,E

The purpose of the present study was to compare both myocardial protection techniques in terms of patient outcome. We retrospectively analyzed the charts of 150 consecutive patients subjected to coronary artery surgery using the ES-technique; 150 patients matched for age, gender, preoperative left ventricular function, history of renal failure, and history of neurological symptoms undergoing surgery with conventional CP during the same time period served as control group. There were no significant differences between both groups with respect to perioperative myocardial infarction rate, need for positive inotropic medication, need for mechanical circulatory support, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of intensive care unit stay, time of mobilization, postoperative renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, neurological symptoms, infections or in-hospital mortality. ES-patients were less frequently readmitted to the intensive care unit (ES: 3/150; 2.2% [95% confidence interval: 0-4.2%] vs. CP: 13/150; 8.7% [4.2-13.2%]; P=0.010) and total hospital stay was shorter (ES: 12.3+/-4.8 days [95% CI: 11.5-13.0] vs CP: 13.5+/-3.8 [12.9-14.1] days; P=0.0013), thus saving 159 patient days on the normal ward. Procedural costs were less for the ES-technique (US$ 60 per patient) as compared to the cardioplegia technique (US$ 120 per patient). These data suggest that myocardial protection using the ES-technique does not improve clinical outcome in patients subjected to routine coronary artery surgery, but may save costs.",E,E

However, clinical trials may not reflect actual drug use in the population.; To examine the distribution and determinants of patterns of use of antihypertensive agents in the first 5 years of hypertension treatment in Saskatchewan.; Patterns of use and modifications to therapy were derived from a careful examination of medication use in a cohort of 19 501 subjects aged 40 to 79 years, without recognized cardiac disease and initiating therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a calcium antagonist, or a beta-blocker in Saskatchewan between 1990 and 1993.; Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (37.4%), followed by calcium antagonists (27.5%) and beta-blockers (26.4%), were the most commonly prescribed agents to initiate treatment in our study population. Patients with diabetes were less likely to be dispensed a beta-blocker, as were younger and female patients. Previous visits to a cardiologist decreased the likelihood of receiving combination therapy or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors but increased that of using calcium antagonists. Apart from dose adjustment, 89% of study subjects underwent at least 1 modification to their initial regimen, at a median time of 134 days. After 1 year, only 33.8% of patients were still using their initial drug. An early decrease in the proportion of patients continuing to receive initial therapy was noted, especially among beta-blocker users.; Erratic drug-taking behaviors were observed in this Saskatchewan population. In addition, initial drug use does not seem to be in accordance with the stepped-care approach to hypertension therapy recommended in the Canadian guidelines.",E,E

An interim analysis of the AASK at 3 years revealed a renoprotective effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril as compared to the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (DHP-CCB) amlodipine in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. This differential effect was independent of the blood pressure (BP) levels reached and was evident in proteinuric patients and suggestive in patients with baseline proteinuria < 300 mg/d, but was not conclusive. The AASK trial data suggest that DHP-CCBs should be used cautiously in the presence of mild to moderate renal insufficiency. Judgment should be reserved for the use of other CCBs, such as verapamil or diltiazem, since these are fundamentally different CCBs with the potential for a different impact on hypertensive nephrosclerosis. The blinded observation period for AASK will be completed at the end of September, 2001, at which time additional, clinically useful information is expected to become available.

Stepwise multivariate regression analyses were performed with 10 variables (age, etiology, LVEF, symptom class, atenolol/placebo, norepinephrine, big ET, log aminoterminal atrial natriuretic peptide, log aminoterminal B-type natriuretic peptide [N-BNP] and log B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]). During the study, the last values prior to patient death were used, and in survivors the last hormone level, New York Heart Association class and LVEF at month 24 were used.; Thirty-one patients died from a cardiovascular cause during follow-up.

The use of prophylactic pacing strategies to prevent post-operative AF has been controversial. We previously performed a pilot study which suggested that the combination of beta-blockers and bi-atrial pacing (BAP) may reduce AF after cardiac surgery. We prospectively randomized 118 patients to continuous BAP for up to 96 hours post-operatively versus standard therapy. All patients were treated with beta-blockers as tolerated. Patients were paced in the AAI mode at a rate of 100 pulses per minute. The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of sustained AF (>10 minutes). There was a significant reduction in the incidence of AF in the BAP group among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery with or without aortic valve replacement (35 % vs. 19 % AF; OR=0.38, 95 % CI 0.15, 0.93; p <0.05). Including patients undergoing isolated aortic valve surgery (n=7), there remained a strong trend toward a reduction of AF with pacing (no atrial pacing [NAP] vs. BAP; 35 % vs. 21 % AF; OR=0.48, 95 % CI 0.21, 1.11; p=0.08). Patients age 70 or greater benefited most from pacing (NAP vs. BAP; 55 vs. 25 % AF; p<0.05), while those less than 70 years of age did not (17 vs. 18 % p=NS). There was a significant reduction in the amount of time spent in the intensive care unit among patients receiving BAP (50+/-40 vs. 37+/-25 h; p<0.05).BAP together with beta-blockade after coronary artery bypass graft surgery reduces the incidence of post-operative atrial AF. Elderly patients (age 70 or greater) appear to benefit most, and may be a group to whom this therapy should be targeted.",E,E

Drug influences on Doppler-derived parameters from the cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity wave form were evaluated in a randomized, double blind, cross-over, placebo controlled study. The mean CBF velocity, pulsatility index (PI), cerebrovascular resistance and index of CBF were calculated from concomitant transcranial Doppler measurements and systemic blood pressure.; Acebutolol and perindopril significantly decreased systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure in relation to placebo.

However, perindopril augmented the CBF index more effectively than acebutolol (p<0.05).; Among patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension both acebutolol and perindopril beneficially decreased cerebrovascular resistance and increased the CBF index in comparison with placebo. The increase of CBF index was greater after perindopril than acebutolol, which suggests a more significant improvement in cerebral perfusion by perindopril. The non-invasive transcranial Doppler ultrasonography method of CBF velocity measurement may contribute to choosing optimal antihypertensive therapies and to monitor their effect.",3,E

Analysis is based on intention-to-treat.; It was demonstrated that in spite of the expected increase in the overall risk of death and hospitalisation, patients who are diabetic, have renal impairment, NYHA class IV symptoms, are elderly, are taking either digitalis, amiodarone or aldosterone antagonists as co-medication benefit equally from beta-blockade with bisoprolol as patients without these complications or drugs. Benefit was shown for the primary endpoint all cause mortality, as well as for the secondary endpoints.; Contrary to the hitherto prevailing doctrine of not using beta-blockers in high risk patient groups with chronic heart failure, retrospective analyses of the CIBIS II study justify the use of this drug class in patients regardless of age, NYHA functional class, the presence of diabetes, renal impairment or concomitant treatment with digitalis, amiodarone or aldosterone antagonists.",I,8

Lacidipine but not atenolol increased the vasodilation to acetylcholine and bradykinin and restored the inhibiting effect of L-NMMA on endothelium-dependent vasodilation, without affecting the response to sodium nitroprusside. Moreover, lacidipine reduced circulating markers of oxidative stress including plasma and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) hydroperoxides, the susceptibility of LDL to Cu2+-induced oxidation and the reactive oxygen species generated from human umbilical vein endothelial cells after incubation with LDL derived from plasma of the patients.; Lacidipine increases endothelium-dependent vasodilation by restoring NO availability, and this effect possibly is related to antioxidant activity.",E,E

Clinic and ambulatory heart rate was reduced to a greater extent (P < 0.01) by atenolol than nebivolol. Atenolol was associated with an approximately 20% reduction in insulin sensitivity (insulin-induced glucose disposal rate/mean insulin concentration ratio, P < 0.01) and an approximately 10% reduction in glucose disappearance rate (K-value, P < 0.05), whereas these variables were not significantly modified with nebivolol. Cardiac output was reduced similarly (P < 0.05) by both drugs at rest but forearm blood flow, forearm vascular resistance or total peripheral resistance were unaffected. A significant inverse correlation coefficient between cardiac output and insulin sensitivity was found at baseline, suggesting that a compensatory increase in systemic blood flow occurs in hypertensive patients with progressively more marked insulin resistance. This relationship was unaffected by nebivolol but was lost with atenolol.; These results indicate that insulin sensitivity was not modified significantly by nebivolol, whereas it was reduced by atenolol, although blood pressure was decreased to the same extent by both drugs. Neither drug induced systemic or forearm vasodilatation but the inverse relationship between cardiac output and insulin sensitivity was preserved with nebivolol but not with atenolol.",E,E

Do antihypertensive drugs promote cancer? Do antihypertensive drugs protect against cancer? We previously analysed the frequency of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in elderly people who participated in the Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension 2 (STOP-Hypertension-2). We have also looked at the frequency of cancer in these patients.; We randomly assigned 6614 elderly patients with hypertension (mean age 76 years, median time of follow-up 5.3 years) to one of three treatment strategies: conventional drugs (diuretics or b-blockers), calcium antagonists, or ACE inhibitors. We matched the patients to the Swedish Cancer Registry and compared our findings with expected values based on age, sex, and calendar-year-specific reference frequencies for the general Swedish population. We also compared the number of cancers between the three treatment groups.; At baseline, 607 (9%) patients had previous malignant disease. Diagnoses were closely similar to the distribution of cancer types that might be seen in elderly patients. During follow-up, there were 625 new cases of cancer in 590 patients. The frequency of cancer did not differ significantly between the treatment strategies, including all cancers and those at individual sites. The standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for all cancers were also close to unity: 0.92 (95% CI 0.80-1.06) for conventional drugs, 0.96 (0.83-1.10) for calcium antagonists, and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for ACE inhibitors.; No difference in cancer risk was seen between patients randomly assigned to conventional drugs, calcium antagonists, or ACE inhibitors. Thus, the general message to the practising physician is that more attention should be given to getting the blood pressure down than to the risk of cancer.",E,E

Thus it is necessary to establish therapy to improve the outcome in this high-risk population.; We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program and identified patients with AF at the time of enrollment. In these trials, 1094 patients with at least 3 months of heart failure symptoms and an ejection fraction < or = 0.35 were randomly assigned to receive carvedilol or placebo in a double-blind, stratified program according to performance on an exercise test.; One hundred thirty-six patients with concomitant AF and CHF were identified during the screening visit (84 assigned to carvedilol and 52 to placebo). Therapy with carvedilol resulted in a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (from 23% to 33% with carvedilol and from 24% to 27% with placebo, P =.001). The physician global assessment improved in a greater number of patients treated with carvedilol than in those treated with placebo (71% vs 48%, P =.025).

Also, the analysis of the US Carvedilol Program indicated an effect on these end points. Although none of these trials are large enough to provide definitive results in any particular subgroup, it is natural for physicians to examine the consistency of results across various subgroups or risk groups. Our purpose was to examine both predefined and post hoc subgroups in the MERIT-HF trial to provide guidance as to whether any subgroup is at increased risk, despite an overall strongly positive effect, and to discuss the difficulties and limitations in conducting such subgroup analyses.; The study was conducted at 313 clinical sites in 16 randomization regions across 14 countries, with a total of 3991 patients. Total mortality (first primary end point) and total mortality plus all-cause hospitalization (second primary end point) were analyzed on a time to first event. The first secondary end point was total mortality plus hospitalization for heart failure.; Overall, MERIT-HF demonstrated a hazard ratio of 0.66 for total mortality and 0.81 for mortality plus all-cause hospitalization. The hazard ratio of the first secondary end point of mortality plus hospitalization for heart failure was 0.69. The results were remarkably consistent for both primary outcomes and the first secondary outcome across all predefined subgroups as well as for nearly all post hoc subgroups. The results of the post hoc US subgroup showed a mortality hazard ratio of 1.05. However, the US results regarding both the second primary combined outcome of total mortality plus all-cause hospitalization and of the first secondary combined outcome of total mortality plus heart failure hospitalization were in concordance with the overall results of MERIT-HF. Tests of country by treatment interaction (14 countries) revealed a nonsignificant P value of.22 for total mortality. The mortality hazard ratio for US patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV was 0.80, and it was 2.24 for patients in NYHA class II, which is not consistent with causality by biologic gradient. We have not been able to identify any confounding factor in baseline characteristics, baseline treatment, or treatment during follow-up that could account for any treatment by country interaction. Thus we attribute the US subgroup mortality hazard ratio to be due to chance.; Just as we must be extremely cautious in overinterpreting positive effects in subgroups, even those that are predefined, we must also be cautious in focusing on subgroups with an apparent neutral or negative trend. We should examine subgroups to obtain a general sense of consistency, which is clearly the case in MERIT-HF. We should expect some variation of the treatment effect around the overall estimate as we examine a large number of subgroups because of small sample size in subgroups and chance. Thus the best estimate of the treatment effect on total mortality for any subgroup is the estimate of the hazard ratio for the overall trial.",E,E

We present our experience with carvedilol titration in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIb/IV patients stabilized on milrinone therapy, as a nonrandomized study with a parallel control group of patients never on inotropes. These patients achieved volume control and stabilization of their symptoms during the course of milrinone therapy.; Seventeen patients in class IIIb/IV CHF (group 1) on intermittent intravenous milrinone therapy and 15 patients in class II/IIIa compensated CHF (group 2) on standard triple heart failure therapy were titrated on carvedilol. Success and adverse events during titration were compared between the 2 groups. Fifteen (88%) patients in group 1 and 14 (93%) patients in group 2 were successfully titrated on carvedilol over 8.1 +/- 1.8 weeks and 6.7 +/- 2.8 weeks, respectively. The target dose of carvedilol (25 or 50 mg twice daily) was achieved in 13 (87%) patients (group 1) and 14 (93%) patients (group 2). Seven (47%) patients in group 1 and 4 (28%) patients in group 2 had adverse events during carvedilol titration.

Most of these patients can be successfully weaned off of milrinone or have decreased frequency of infusions and demonstrate improved functional status. Prospective randomized trials are required to evaluate these observations made in a limited number of patients in class IIIb and IV CHF because the combination of milrinone and beta-blockers has never been adequately evaluated.",E,E

The severity of depressive symptoms was weekly assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Allelic variation of 5-HTTLPR in each subject was determined using a polymerase chain reaction-based technique.; 5-HTTLPR short variant was associated with a poor response to fluvoxamine treatment, independently from the recorded clinical variables. More specifically, the diagnosis, the presence of psychotic features, and the severity of depressive symptomatology did not influence this association. Conversely, pindolol augmentation may ameliorate the rate of response in 5-HTTLPR short variant subjects, thus reducing the difference in the response rate among the genotype variants.; If confirmed, these results may improve patient care by helping the clinician to individualize treatment according to the patient's genetic 5-HTTLPR pattern.",E,E

Sessions of ligation were repeated every two to three weeks until the varices were eradicated. The initial dose of nadolol was 80 mg orally once daily, with adjustment according to the resting heart rate; isosorbide mononitrate was given in increasing doses, beginning at 20 mg once a day at bed time and rising over the course of one week to 40 mg orally twice a day, unless side effects occurred. The primary end points were recurrent bleeding, complications, and death.; The median follow-up period was 21 months. A total of 35 patients in the ligation group and 24 in the medication group had recurrent bleeding. The probability of recurrence was lower in the medication group, both for all episodes related to portal hypertension (P=0.04) and for recurrent variceal bleeding (P=0.04). There were major complications in nine patients treated with ligation (seven had bleeding esophageal ulcers and two had aspiration pneumonia) and two treated with medication (both had bradycardia and dyspnea) (P=0.05). Thirty patients in the ligation group died, as did 23 patients in the medication group (P=0.52).

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase, is synthesized by many types of cells including vascular endothelial cells. The serum level of ADMA is elevated in patients with essential hypertension, but the mechanism for this increase is unknown. Therefore, the present study examined whether the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved. Patients with essential hypertension [systolic blood pressure (BP) > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP > 95 mmHg] were randomized to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment group (perindopril, 4mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7), an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist treatment group (losartan, 50 mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7) or a beta-blocker treatment group (bisoprolol, 5 mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7). Before and after the treatment, BP, serum concentration of ADMA and plasma concentration of von Willebrand factor (vWF, a biological marker of endothelial injury) were measured. Perindopril, losartan and bisoprolol decreased BP to a similar extent, and either perindopril or losartan, but not bisoprolol, significantly decreased serum ADMA and plasma vWF. These findings suggest that the RAS may contribute to the mechanism of increased serum ADMA as well as to the endothelial injury observed in hypertensive patients. The vasculoprotective actions of ACE inhibitors or AT1 receptor antagonists may be explained at least in part by amelioration of the endothelial injury through a decrease in the serum ADMA concentration.",E,E

In addition, H induced a significant reduction of the preload as seen from STI, and B significantly reduced HR (-5 bpm). N induced a significant decrease in TPR (about 15% of baseline values) and showed corresponding changes in STI. PRA increased significantly following I alone (1.5-2.0 ng/ml/h), as well as combined with N (2.5 ng/ ml/h) or H (3.1 ng/ml/h). This increase was clearly blunted by the co-administration of B (0.6 ng/ml/h).; The combination of imidapril with a diuretic, beta-adrenoceptor antagonist or calcium-channel blocker seems a reasonable and safe treatment option when striving for additive pharmacodynamic effects not accompanied by relevant pharmacokinetic interactions.",E,E

Combining results from various outcome studies may provide evidence to guide the therapeutic approach even before results from large prospective studies are available. However, meta-analysis may be misleading if it is not done meticulously. Some meta-analyses that received broad news media coverage in the recent years were misleading. One analysis suggested that the use of short-acting nifedipine in moderate to high doses in patients with coronary disease increased mortality. This claim was refuted later by observational studies. Based on another meta-analysis, it was claimed that diuretics and beta-blockers are equally effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Another more careful meta-analysis, omitting one study in which most patients were on combination therapy and not on beta-blocker monotherapy, showed the superiority of diuretic versus b-blocker treatment in the elderly. Calcium antagonists were recently blamed for increasing the rate of myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure in hypertensive patients, and therefore their use was not recommended as first-line therapy in hypertension. This recommendation was based on a meta-analysis subject to major drawbacks and was misleading. Another notion based on meta-analysis was that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce left ventricular mass more than diuretics. This notion was refuted by three large randomized studies. A recent meta-analysis, which showed a similar blood pressure lowering effect for all angiotensin receptor blockers, was refuted by head-to-head studies. Thus, when performed correctly, meta-analysis can be an important tool, but when uncritically employed, it is prone to be misleading.",I,8

It was significantly more effective than placebo in large (n >100), double-blind, randomised, multicentre clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Telmisartan 20 to 160 mg once daily produced mean reductions in supine trough systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of up to 15.5 and 10.5 mm Hg, respectively. Maximum blood pressure reduction occurred with a dosage of 40 to 80 mg/day. Telmisartan 40 to 120 mg/day was as effective as amlodipine 5 to 10 mg/day or atenolol 50 to 100 mg/day in dose-titration studies. Telmisartan 20 to 160 mg/day was generally similar in efficacy to enalapril 5 to 20 mg/day or lisinopril 10 to 40 mg/day in both titration-to-response and other studies. Hydrochlorothiazide was coadministered in most of the titration-to-response studies if patients remained hypertensive. Telmisartan 80 mg/day was more effective than submaximal dosages of losartan (50 mg/day) or valsartan (80 mg/day) and was as effective as a fixed-dose combination of losartan 50 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg over the last 6 hours of the dosage interval and the whole 24-hour postdose interval. In patients with severe hypertension, telmisartan 80 to 160 mg/day was as effective as enalapril 20 to 40 mg/day (both agents could be titrated and combined sequentially with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and amlodipine 5 mg). The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to telmisartan was more effective than each agent alone at lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Telmisartan was well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate hypertension and was significantly less likely to cause persistent, dry cough than lisinopril.; Telmisartan is an effective antihypertensive agent with a tolerability profile similar to that of placebo. Comparative data have shown telmisartan to be as effective as other major classes of antihypertensive agents at lowering blood pressure. Compared with lisinopril, telmisartan is associated with a significantly lower incidence of dry, persistent cough. Therefore, telmisartan is a useful therapeutic option in the management of patients with hypertension.",E,E

Interruption of the renin-angiotensin system slows the progression of renal disease in patients with type 1 diabetes, but similar data are not available for patients with type 2, the most common form of diabetes. We assessed the role of the angiotensin-II-receptor antagonist losartan in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.; A total of 1513 patients were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind study comparing losartan (50 to 100 mg once daily) with placebo, both taken in addition to conventional antihypertensive treatment (calcium-channel antagonists, diuretics, alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, and centrally acting agents), for a mean of 3.4 years. The primary outcome was the composite of a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine concentration, end-stage renal disease, or death. Secondary end points included a composite of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes, proteinuria, and the rate of progression of renal disease.; A total of 327 patients in the losartan group reached the primary end point, as compared with 359 in the placebo group (risk reduction, 16 percent; P=0.02). Losartan reduced the incidence of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration (risk reduction, 25 percent; P=0.006) and end-stage renal disease (risk reduction, 28 percent; P=0.002) but had no effect on the rate of death. The benefit exceeded that attributable to changes in blood pressure. The composite of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes was similar in the two groups, although the rate of first hospitalization for heart failure was significantly lower with losartan (risk reduction, 32 percent; P=0.005). The level of proteinuria declined by 35 percent with losartan (P<0.001 for the comparison with placebo).; Losartan conferred significant renal benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy, and it was generally well tolerated.",E,E

Among them, drugs used to treat hypertension are the single largest component. Variability in how these drugs are prescribed should be based on the specific characteristics of patients. However, some evidence shows that physician characteristics can also play a substantial role in prescribing trends. Such variation is also associated with varying beneficial and adverse patient outcomes.; To determine whether prescribing patterns of drugs used to treat hypertension in elderly patients in Nova Scotia varied by physician characteristics.; A retrospective, population-based descriptive study was done using the Nova Scotia Pharmacare program data for the fiscal year 1995/96. The unit of analysis was the individual physician. All drugs indicated in the management of hypertension were included for the analysis.; Of 1466 physicians included in the analysis, 1004 were family physicians (FPs) and/or general practitioners (GPs), 155 were internal medicine specialists and 307 were other specialists. Fifty-eight per cent of 103,193 eligible senior citizens received at least one of the study medications. FPs and/or GPs prescribed 95.9% of all the study drugs. Internists prescribed proportionately fewer angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, thiazides and other diuretics compared with the FPs and/or GPs but more beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. A large proportion of the FPs and/or GPs (55.3%) prescribed less than 10% of the total day's supply of drugs, whereas a small proportion of FPs and/or GPs (16.3%) prescribed 52.6% of all the study drugs. There was no variation in the distribution of the types of antihypertensives prescribed based on physician age, sex or volume of prescribing. A slight variation in prescribing was seen with location of practice.; Patterns of prescribing cardiovascular drugs used to treat hypertension were remarkably unaffected by physician characteristics. This finding counters other evidence in the literature that has raised concerns over prescribing patterns of certain types of physicians. Prescribing patterns may vary for other drug classes, but for this group of antihypertensives, little variability was found.",E,E

Serial echocardiography, right heart catheterization, and treadmill exercise testing were performed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. After exclusions, 49 patients were evaluated during monotherapy and 48 during combination therapy.; Carvedilol monotherapy produced significant reductions in end-systolic volume, leading to a greater median increase in ejection fraction compared with captopril monotherapy (4.7% vs 1.5%, respectively; P <.05). Each drug caused similar reductions in left ventricular mass, chamber sphericity, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure during monotherapy and combined treatment. Adjunctive treatment with carvedilol produced a trend toward a greater increase in ejection fraction (4.3% vs 2.7%, respectively; P not significant) and significantly greater reductions in the wall thickening score index than with captopril (0.25 vs 0.08, respectively; P =.04).; Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy did not alter left ventricular volume, treatment with carvedilol was associated with reductions in chamber volume; both drugs reduced left ventricular mass and sphericity.

We constructed a risk-stratification score for each patient based on adjusted odds ratios for clinical variables likely to predict adverse outcomes. We stratified all trial subjects by their risk scores and studied the rates of death or myocardial infarction (MI) of the early invasive management strategy in each stratum.; The final multivariate model included older age, ST segment depression on presentation, history of complicated angina before presentation, and elevation in baseline creatine kinase-MB fraction. Although patients with a higher risk score had an increased rate of death or MI within 42 days and 365 days (p < 0.001) in both management strategies, early invasive management for patients in the high and very high risk categories was associated with a lower rate of death or MI within 42 days compared with conservative management. No such benefit was seen in patients in the larger group of patients in the very low, low or moderate risk categories (p = 0.03 for the interaction between risk category and management assignment).; Risk stratification may be an effective method for identifying those patients with unstable angina or NQMI most likely to benefit from early invasive management.

Apart from a loop diuretic and digoxin, most patients should now be receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (or angiotensin II receptor blocker), a beta-blocker and spironolactone. Newer drugs, such as endothelin-receptor antagonists and combined blockers of converting-enzyme and neutral endopeptidase, might soon become available. When to introduce these drugs and what dose is optimal for any individual, are questions that currently vex clinicians. We proposed that plasma levels of the cardiac hormone brain natriuretic peptide (BNP, or better, its 1-76 amino-acid N-terminal fragment, N-BNP), would provide an objective index for guiding drug treatment in patients with established, stable cardiac failure. In a pilot study, 69 patients were randomized to drug treatment based on clinical criteria, or based on plasma levels of N-BNP. After a median follow-up of 9.6 months, those in the N-BNP group had fewer clinical end-points than those in the group managed by clinical criteria alone (19 vs 54; P= 0.02).

Blood pressure and heart rate were measured before and after dosing; cardiac rhythm was recorded by 4-hour Holter monitoring. The only potentially clinically significant interactions between SL apomorphine and the antihypertensive agents or short-acting nitrates were greater orthostatic decreases in systolic blood pressure in the alpha-blocker and calcium channel blocker groups (-10 and -6 mm Hg vs placebo, respectively). Administration of SL apomorphine after dosing with long-acting nitrates resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure when patients were standing (mean systolic change, -5 to -9 mm Hg 30 to 60 minutes postdose, p <0.05; mean diastolic change, -3 to -4 mm Hg 50 to 60 minutes postdose, p <0.05). The most common adverse events with SL apomorphine were dizziness, nausea, and headache. Syncope occurred in 1 patient in the beta-blocker group; symptomatic hypotension occurred in 2 patients each in the short- and long-acting nitrate groups.

This paper describes a HOT substudy in which patients underwent both office measurement and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.; The mean age of the substudy population was 62 +/- 7 years. Substudy patients were treated for a median period of 2 years. All received the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist felodipine, while some also received an ACE-inhibitor, a beta-blocker or a diuretic.

Forearm blood flow (FBF) was assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography during local intra-arterial infusions of methacholine and sodium nitroprusside, to evaluate endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilatation, respectively. Measurements of FBF were undertaken at the end of the run-in placebo period and repeated after 3 months of active antihypertensive treatment.; Irbesartan and atenolol induced a similar decline in blood pressure (from 171/107 to 158/98 mmHg, P < 0.05), and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (e.g. an increase in FBF response to 4 microg/min methacholine from 325 +/- 29% to 411 +/- 41%, P < 0.05), with no difference between the two study drugs.

A total of 241 patients were included in the study. All of them were hypertensive and had a 25% or at least 0.5 mg/dl increase in the value of serum creatinine during the 24 months prior to entering the study. Initial doses of fosinopril and nifedipine GITS were 10 and 30 mg respectively, and titration to 30 and 60 mg was performed if needed to obtain the expected blood pressure goal (< 140/90 mmHg). Furosemide, atenolol, and doxazosin were added as second, third, and fourth drugs if necessary, for blood pressure control. The primary end-point of the study was the appearance of double the serum creatinine values and/or the need to enter a dialysis programme. Secondary end-points were cardiovascular events, death, changes in 24 h proteinuria, and the evolution of serum creatinine. Data reflect the analysis performed by intention to treat.; Mean age of the group was 54 +/- 14, and 59% were males. Primary glomerulonephritis (31%), nephrosclerosis (26%) and polycystic kidney disease (19%) were the three most frequent diagnostic findings. After 3 years of follow-up, 21% (27/127) of patients treated with fosinopril, and 36% (40/112) of those receiving nifedipine GITS presented a primary end-point, (OR 0.47, 95% confidence intervals 0.26-0.84, P = 0.01). Renal survival was significantly better when fosinopril constituted the first step therapy (P = 0.002). These results did not seem to be influenced by the type of primary renal disease. Proteinuria decreased at the end of the study by a mean of 57% in the fosinopril group and increased by 7% in the group receiving dihydropiridine. Blood pressure control did not differ among groups for diastolic values. During follow-up, however, the patients receiving ACEi showed systolic blood pressure values 4-6 mmHg lower.; In patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension due to primary renal disease, fosinopril significantly differed from nifedipine GITS by its capacity to slow the progressive decay in renal function. The drugs also differed by their capacity to lower blood pressure. The better control, in particular of systolic blood pressure, in the fosinopril arm could have contributed in a relevant manner to the attainment of a better outcome when the ACEi was employed.",E,E

Consequently, there is a high coincidence between hypertension and ED. Oral sildenafil (Viagra) is an effective treatment for ED in patients with treated or untreated hypertension. The most common adverse events of sildenafil (headache, flushing, hypotension) result from its moderate vasodilating properties. The concomitant use of sildenafil and organic nitrates is contraindicated because it may lead to a potentiation of the decreases in blood pressure and thus cause life-threatening hypotension. In contrast, the concomitant use of sildenafil and different classes of antihypertensive agents (beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists) may lead to additive but not to potentiating blood pressure decreases. Thus, this combination is unlikely to cause clinically significant hypotension or an increased incidence of adverse events.

Therapeutic trials based on cardiovascular mortality have recently shown that SBP reduction requires normalization of both large artery stiffness and wave reflections. The aim of the present study was to compare the antihypertensive effects of the very-low-dose combination indapamide (0.625 mg) and perindopril (2 mg) (Per/Ind) with the beta-blocking agent atenolol (50 mg) to determine whether Per/Ind decreases SBP and pulse pressure (PP) more than does atenolol and, if so, whether this decrease is predominantly due to reduction of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) (automatic measurements) and reduction of wave reflections (pulse wave analysis, applanation tonometry). In a double-blind randomized study, 471 patients with essential hypertension were followed for 12 months. For the same DBP reduction, Per/Ind decreased brachial SBP (-6.02 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -8.90 to -3.14) and PP (-5.57; 95% confidence interval, -7.70 to -3.44) significantly more than did atenolol. This difference was significantly more pronounced for the carotid artery than for the brachial artery. Whereas the 2 antihypertensive agents decreased PWV to a similar degree, only Per/Ind significantly attenuated carotid wave reflections, resulting in a selective decrease in SBP and PP.

The aims of the present study were to determine the doses of B9340, a bradykinin receptor antagonist, that inhibit vasodilatation to exogenous bradykinin and to assess the contribution of bradykinin to the maintenance of basal vascular tone in patients with heart failure receiving chronic ACE inhibitor therapy.; Forearm blood flow was measured using bilateral venous occlusion plethysmography. On three occasions in a double-blind randomized manner, 8 healthy volunteers received intrabrachial infusions of placebo or B9340 (at 4.5 and 13.5 nmol/min). On each occasion, placebo or B9340 was coinfused with bradykinin (30 to 3000 pmol/min) and substance P (4 to 16 pmol/min). B9340 caused no change in basal FBF but produced dose-dependent inhibition of the vasodilatation to bradykinin (P<0.001) but not substance P. The effects of bradykinin antagonism were studied in 17 patients with NYHA grade II through IV heart failure maintained on chronic ACE inhibitor therapy. Incremental doses of B9340, but not HOE-140, produced a dose-dependent vasoconstriction (P=0.01). After withdrawal of ACE inhibitor therapy, B9340 produced no significant change in forearm blood flow. After reinstitution of therapy, B9340 again resulted in vasoconstriction (P<0.03).; B9340 is a potent and selective inhibitor of bradykinin-induced vasodilatation. Bradykinin does not contribute to the maintenance of basal peripheral arteriolar tone in healthy humans or patients with heart failure but contributes to the vasodilatation associated with chronic ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with heart failure via the B(1) receptor.",E,E

Nonselective versus selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists may have differential effects on norepinephrine release from nerve terminals mediated by prejunctional beta(2)-adrenergic receptors.; Thirty-six patients with chronic heart failure were randomized to the nonselective beta-blocker carvedilol or the selective beta-blocker metoprolol (double-blind). Measurements of hemodynamics and cardiac and systemic norepinephrine spillover as well as microneurographic recordings of muscle sympathetic nerve traffic were made before and after 4 months of therapy. In the carvedilol group (n=17), there were significant reductions in both total body (-1.7+/-0.5 nmol/min, P<0.01) and cardiac norepinephrine spillover (-87+/-29 pmol/min, P<0.01). By contrast, in the metoprolol group (n=14), there were no significant changes in total body or cardiac norepinephrine spillover. Responses in the carvedilol group were significantly different from those observed in the metoprolol group (P<0.05). Both agents caused a reduction in heart rate and increases in pulse pressure, although mean arterial pressure did not change. Importantly, microneurographic measures of sympathetic nerve traffic to skeletal muscle did not change in either group.; Therapy with carvedilol caused significant decreases in systemic and cardiac norepinephrine spillover, an indirect measure of norepinephrine release. Such changes were not observed in patients treated with metoprolol. There was no effect of either agent on sympathetic efferent neuronal discharge to skeletal muscle. These findings suggest that carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker, caused its sympathoinhibitory effect by blocking peripheral, prejunctional beta-adrenergic receptors.",E,E

Unfortunately, despite the fact that patients over age 75 represent a large subgroup with an exceptionally high case-fatality rate, most randomized clinical trials have enrolled few patients in this group. As a result, therapeutic recommendations for managing acute MI in the very elderly are often extrapolated from studies conducted in younger patients. This article reviews current evidence-based guidelines for early treatment of acute MI in the elderly. As in younger patients, aspirin, beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be considered standard therapy in appropriately selected elderly patients. Although the benefits of reperfusion therapy (i.e., thrombolysis and primary angioplasty) are less well established, advanced age per se should not be considered a contraindication to the use of these interventions. Given the relative paucity of data in the very elderly, additional studies are needed to define optimal pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of acute MI in this rapidly growing, high-risk population.",E,E

In a double blind study, 34 essential hypertensive patients were treated for 3 months with either ramipril 2.5-5.0 mg daily (n = 17, age 57 +/- 7 y, 11 males) or atenolol 50-100 mg daily (n = 17, age 53 +/- 8 y, 11 males). Blood pressure (BP), brachial artery diameter (D), brachial-radial pulse wave velocity (PWV) and effective compliance (Ceff), were measured before and at the end of the study. Isobaric evaluation (Ciso) was performed in the entire population studied at an average mean BP of 110 mmHg.

In addition, it significantly improved both PWV (18%; p < 0.001) and arterial compliance (45%; p < 0.001), from which 35% was related to a pressure independent effect (p < 0.01). Atenolol also induced a reduction in both BP (159 +/- 17/96 +/- 10 to 133 +/- 13/81 +/- 8 mmHg; p < 0.001) and HR (76 +/- 10 to 57 +/- 7 bpm; p < 0.001). In a similar way, PWV (11%; p < 0.05) and Ceff (30%; p < 0.05) were significantly improved without significant change in Ciso. This suggests that blood pressure reduction was responsible for compliance improvement. In conclusion, it is suggested that atenolol induces only hemodynamic changes, mediated mainly by BP reduction. In contrast, the improved brachial buffering function observed after ramipril involves not only hemodynamic changes, but also changes mediated by other mechanisms, such as modification of wall structures.",1,E

They were immediately randomized to either intravenous diltiazem (10 mg bolus + 10 mg/hour for 3 days) (group 1, n = 43) or placebo (group 2, n = 47) and subsequently treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. All underwent serial echocardiograms upon admission, 4 days post-admission during low-dose dobutamine stress echo, at discharge and after 6 months. We calculated the dysfunction score (1 = hypokinesia, 2 = akinesia, 3 = dyskinesia) on admission and its percent reduction after dobutamine (viability) and at follow-up (recovery). The 12-lead electrocardiograms were continuously monitored for 3 days and coronary angioplasty was performed whenever the residual stenosis was > 60%.; Upon admission, there were no differences in age, sex, infarct location and size, degree of ST-segment elevation, time from onset of symptoms and dysfunction score. Creatine kinase peaked early in 70% of patients in both groups; the incidences of recurrent ischemia, infarct-related vessel patency and the need for coronary angioplasty were also similar. The creatine kinase peak was significantly higher in group 2 (2931 +/- 2456 vs 1726 +/- 1004 IU/l, p < 0.05). Conversely, in group 1 the residual viability was significantly higher (51 +/- 23 vs 36 +/- 30% improvement in dysfunction score, p < 0.05) and the early recovery of regional function was significantly greater (35 +/- 34 vs 18 +/- 22% at discharge, p < 0.05). On the other hand, the delayed recovery was not significantly different (15 +/- 29 vs 21 +/- 32% from the time of discharge to 6 months of follow-up).; Intravenous diltiazem, started before coronary reperfusion, has beneficial effects on the infarct size, residual viability and recovery of regional function. If confirmed by larger trials, these preliminary results suggest the use of diltiazem as adjunctive therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction and undergoing reperfusion.",E,E

A recent observational study suggested that BB use concurrent with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) decreased the risk of creatine kinase (CK)-MB elevation. The cogency of such a conclusion is dependent on the ability to risk-adjust for the multiple differences in patients treated with and without BBs.; Using propensity score and multivariate regression analyses, 6200 consecutive patients were analyzed to assess the relationship between BB use before PCI and per protocol-measured CK and CK-MB rise. There were several highly significant (P<0.001) differences between patients with and without BB treatment (eg, age, prior infarction, unstable angina). Maximum CK and CK-MB levels were higher in patients taking BBs (CK median, 95 U [interquartile range: 61, 175]; CK-MB, 3 U [2, 5]) than in patients not taking BBs (CK, 91 U [60, 157]; CK-MB, 3 U [2, 4]) (P=0.011 and P=0.021 for CK and CK-MB, respectively). After adjustment for significant differences in baseline characteristics there was no difference in either maximum CK rise (P=0.21) or maximum CK-MB rise (P=0.99).; The results of this large observation study do not support the contention that BB use before PCI decreases myocardial injury.",E,E

Patients aged 25-66 years with diastolic blood pressure > or =100 mmHg were included and randomized to receive either captopril or conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics and/or beta-blockers).; The primary end point, fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke as well as other cardiovascular deaths, was markedly lower in the captopril than in the conventional therapy group (relative risk [RR] = 0.59; P = 0.018). Specifically, cardiovascular mortality, defined as fatal stroke and myocardial infarction, sudden death, and other cardiovascular death, tended to be lower in the captopril group (RR = 0.48; P = 0.084), and no difference was observed between the study groups for stroke (RR = 1.02; P = 0.96). Myocardial infarctions were less frequent in the captopril group than in the conventional therapy group (RR = 0.34; P = 0.002). Furthermore, total mortality was lower in the captopril as compared with the conventional therapy group (RR = 0.54; P = 0.034). Patients with impaired metabolic control seemed to benefit the most from ACE inhibitor-based therapy.; Captopril is superior to a diuretic/beta-blocker antihypertensive treatment regimen in preventing cardiovascular events in hypertensive diabetic patients, especially in those with metabolic decompensation.",E,E

As combinations, sulfonylureas plus metformin was most popular, followed by metformin plus insulin, and sulfonylureas plus insulin. Sulfonylurea and metformin with insulin was rarely used. There was no significant difference in prescribing of glyburide and metformin between the elderly and young middle-aged diabetic patients; many patients older than 65 years were treated with a beta-blocker along with a long-acting sulfonylurea. Both as monotherapy and in overall use, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium-channel blockers were most often prescribed. Among 35.5% patients treated with antihypertensive combinations, various two- and three-drug combinations of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, and diuretics were often used. The proportion of patients taking atenolol 100 mg/d was higher with combination regimens. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg or equivalent thiazide diuretics were extensively used.; The prescribing pattern of antihypertensives in diabetic hypertension differs in many instances from WHO/ISH guidelines, especially regarding the choice of antihypertensive drugs and their combinations.

Adult patients with newly diagnosed hypertension were randomized to either Group 1 (treatment with diuretics or beta-blockers) or Group 2 (treatment with calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) and followed for 5 +/- 1 months. Physicians practiced standard care while documenting medications, BP measurements, and health care resource use for their patients. A subsequent analysis evaluating the relationship between BP and physician visits was performed for the whole population and for a subpopulation of patients with at least 4 months of follow-up data. Cox regression was used to model time to next visit.; A total of 512 patients with newly diagnosed hypertension were followed: 399 had follow-up data for at least 4 months. Baseline demographic characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. Kaplan-Meier curves and a log-rank test showed that the time to next visit for patients with uncontrolled BP was significantly shorter than for patients whose BP was controlled (P < 0.05). On average, patients with uncontrolled BP (> or = 140/90 mm Hg) had follow-up office visits approximately 13 days earlier than patients with controlled BP (< 140/90 mm Hg). This association remained significant after adjustment for repeated measures, and after exclusion of the first return visit. Cox regression analysis showed that higher systolic and diastolic BP measurements were significantly associated with a shorter time to next visit, after adjustment for age and sex. Total estimated costs during the study period were $170 per patient for medications and $283 per patient for office visits.; In the CHOICE study, higher BP was associated with a shorter time to next visit. Office visits were the main cost driver in the short-term management of hypertension.",E,E

This study was designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of urapidil, as an alternative to labetalol, in preventing the hemodynamic response of ECT. Twenty-seven patients undergoing a series of six consecutive ECT treatments were studied. Each patient received all three pretreatments twice: no drug, labetalol 0.2 mg/kg, or urapidil 25 mg. Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were recorded during the awake state, after anesthesia induction, and 1, 2, 5, 10 and 30 minutes after electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure ended. The duration of the EEG convulsion was also recorded. After induction, the HR increased for no drug and urapidil pretreatments, whereas it decreased when labetalol was given. Labetalol and urapidil attenuated the peak increase of blood pressure and returned it to earlier baseline values. There were no differences in the duration of EEG convulsion between the three pretreatments.

Prospective studies on beta blockers to prevent variceal hemorrhage lack long-term follow-up, and indefinite administration of beta blockers for primary prevention of variceal bleeding has become standard practice. The aim of this study was to determine the outcomes of patients in whom beta blocker therapy was discontinued. Patients completing a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of propranolol for the primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage were tapered off of propranolol and placebo and followed prospectively for subsequent events. Of the 49 patients in the follow-up study (25 former propranolol, 24 former placebo), 9 experienced variceal hemorrhage (6 former propranolol, 3 former placebo). Following withdrawal of propranolol, the freedom from variceal bleeding was not significantly different between these 2 groups of patients, suggesting that the protective effect of propranolol against variceal hemorrhage, noted previously, was no longer present. Seventeen patients died (12 former propranolol, 5 former placebo) during the follow-up study. Cumulative survival was longer in the placebo group. These trends for EVH and survival were opposite to those observed in the original study population while patients were taking medication. When propranolol is withdrawn, the risk of variceal hemorrhage returns to what would be expected in an untreated population. Patients who discontinue beta blockers experience increased mortality compared with an untreated population. These observations support the current practice of indefinite prophylactic therapy.",E,E

Many factors contribute to poor control, including failure of patients to attend physicians, failure of physicians to detect and adequately treat hypertension to goal levels, and failure of patients to persist with prescribed therapy. An under-recognized problem is the failure, both in writing and in the application by third party payers, of consensus guidelines to recognize the important difference between efficacy in clinical trials and effectiveness in clinical practice. The issue of applicability of guidelines to actual practice was studied in the context of a Canadian Family Medicine teaching practice. At the time of the study, consensus guidelines for management of hypertension recommended that drug therapy be initiated with a beta-blocker or diuretic, except for patients with complicated hypertension for whom these drug classes are relatively contraindicated. It was generally assumed that widespread use of other classes of drugs represented inappropriate and wasteful use of resources. By a retrospective chart audit, we determined the proportion of patients in a family practice for whom therapy with a beta-blocker or diuretic was contraindicated, and examined the compliance of the physicians in the practice with guidelines. We found that about half of hypertensives had conditions for which recommended therapy is not a beta-blocker or diuretic.

Several studies suggest that ASA also blunts some of beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on mortality in patients with heart failure. To our knowledge, there have been no data evaluating the possible interaction of ASA and beta-blockers on left ventricular remodeling in patients with heart failure.; We retrospectively evaluated patients entered into the Multicenter Oral Carvedilol Heart failure Assessment (MOCHA) trial, a 6-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose-response evaluation of carvedilol in patients with chronic stable symptomatic heart failure. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine if aspirin independently influenced the improvement in LVEF.; Over all randomized patients (n = 293), LVEF improved 8.2 +/- 0.8 ejection fraction (EF) units in ASA nonusers and 4.5 +/- 0.7 EF units in ASA users (p = 0.005).

There are only sparse data regarding the effects of beta-blockers and antiarrhythmic drugs on TWA.; Patients with a history of documented or suspected malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias were eligible. All patients underwent invasive electrophysiologic (EP) testing including programmed ventricular stimulation and determination of TWA at increasing heart rates using atrial pacing. Reproducibility of TWA at two consecutive drug-free baseline measurements was tested in a random patient subset. Following baseline measurements, all patients were randomized either to double-blind intravenous infusion of sotalol (1.0 mg/kg) or metoprolol (0.1 mg/kg). Results of TWA assessment at baseline and after drug exposure were compared.; Fifty-four consecutive patients were studied. In 12 patients, repetitive baseline measurement of TWA revealed stable alternans voltage (V(alt)) values (9.1 +/- 5.8 microV vs. 8.5 +/- 5.7 microV, p = NS). After drug administration, V(alt) decreased by 35% with metoprolol (7.9 +/- 6.0 microV to 4.9 +/- 4.2 microV; p < 0.001) and by 38% with sotalol (8.6 +/- 6.8 microV to 4.4 +/- 2.3 microV; p = 0.001). In eight patients with positive TWA at baseline, repeated measurement revealed negative test results.; In patients prone to sudden cardiac death, there is a reduction in TWA amplitude following the administration of antiadrenergic drugs. This result indicates that TWA is responsive to the pharmacologic milieu and suggests that, to assess a patient's risk of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia, the patient should be tested while maintaining the pharmacologic regimen under which the risk of arrhythmia is being assessed.

Numerous strategies exist for preoperative cardiac testing before vascular operations. These strategies range from routine evaluation before surgery to a ""minimalist"" approach, treating all patients as though CAD was present. Although advocates of various algorithms often are unwavering in their convictions, there are no randomized, prospective studies comparing different strategies for evaluation and management of patients with CAD undergoing vascular surgery. Potential adverse effects of evaluation and cardiac intervention should be considered before undertaking screening studies. The authors analyzed the adverse outcomes of preoperative cardiac evaluation and intervention before vascular operations in patients treated at the Denver Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Of 153 patients undergoing vascular procedures, 42 had extended cardiac evaluations. Sixteen (38%) patients had untoward events related to this evaluation. Extensive cardiac evaluation before vascular operations can result in morbidity, delays, and refusal to undergo vascular surgery. The underlying indication for vascular operations and the local iatrogenic cardiac complication rates should be considered before ordering special studies. Several recent randomized, prospective studies have established that perioperative beta-adrenergic blockade is beneficial in vascular patients with CAD. Beta-Blocker therapy can reduce the risk of perioperative adverse cardiac outcomes by 55%. The Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis (CARP) trial currently underway is a multicenter, prospective comparison of invasive intervention for CAD versus best medical care in patients undergoing aortic and lower extremity vascular surgery funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program.",E,E

During a subsequent mean follow-up period of 99 months, there were 13 cardiac deaths and 12 noncardiac deaths. Cox regression analysis adjusted for cardiovascular risks revealed that increased postural change (supine to upright) in the power of low-frequency component (LF) power predicted an increased risk for cardiac death (relative risk [per 1-ln ms(2) increment], 4.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.64 to 11.6), while neither the high-frequency component nor its response to HUTT predicted any form of death. When the patients were trichotomized by the level of postural LF change (large drop, < or = - 0.6 ln[ms(2)]; small drop and rise, > 0 ln[ms(2)]), the three groups did not differ in terms of clinical features or CAD severity at baseline or coronary interventions during the follow-up period; however, the 8-year cardiac mortality rates were 0%, 6%, and 12%, respectively (p = 0.008 [log rank test]). Additionally, the difference was enhanced when analyzed excluding 64 patients who had been treated with a beta-blocker during the follow-up period (0%, 7%, and 15%, respectively; p = 0.006 [log rank test]).; The postural response of HRV predicts the risk for death in patients with CAD. Postural LF increase (LF rise), in particular, is an independent risk factor for cardiac death.",E,E

Inotropic responses to milrinone (12.5, 25 or 50 microg/kg bolus infusions) or dobutamine (5, 10, 15 or 20 microg/kg/min infusions) were evaluated by right-heart catheterization.; Milrinone increased cardiac index (2.0-2.6 l/min/m2, P=0.0001) without significantly altering heart rate (70-75 bpm, P=0.19). Milrinone decreased mean pulmonary artery pressure (36-29 mm Hg, P=0.0001), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (24-18 mm Hg, P=0.0001) and mean arterial blood pressure (78-75 mm Hg, P=0.0002).

To explore these hypotheses, the authors examined cancer risk among users of ACE inhibitors in North Jutland County, Denmark.; Using data from the population-based Prescription Database of North Jutland County and the Danish Cancer Registry, cancer incidence among 17,897 individuals prescribed ACE inhibitors was compared with expected incidence based on county specific cancer rates during an 8-year study period with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for cancers overall and at selected sites. In addition, the authors performed a direct comparison of users of ACE inhibitors with users of beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers (n = 47,579 individuals) by means of a Cox proportional hazards model.; Overall, 909 cancer cases were observed among users of ACE inhibitors, with 846 expected based on general population rates, yielding an SIR of 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.15). No risk reductions were observed for cancers of the breast and female reproductive tract, whereas nonsignificantly decreased SIRs were observed for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, and liver. Cancer of the kidney was found in significant excess (SIR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2). Stratification by duration of follow-up or number of prescriptions revealed no apparent trends, except for a tendency toward decreasing risk with increasing length of follow-up for smoking-related cancers. The direct comparison of users of ACE inhibitors with users of beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers yielded results comparable to those derived from the comparison with the general population, with a hazard ratio for cancer overall of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.93-1.09).; This large, population-based cohort study did not confirm a protective effect of ACE inhibitors on the development of cancer. The excess of kidney cancer observed likely reflects a correlation between hypertension and kidney cancer. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of ACE inhibitors beyond the observation period of this and previous studies. Also, the suggestive evidence of decreased risks for upper digestive system cancers and for smoking-related cancers over time may warrant additional investigation.",E,E

Most patients with both disorders have a markedly worsened risk for premature microvascular and macrovascular complications. The appropriate management of the hypertension seen in almost 70% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus remains controversial. However, over the past few years, many randomized, controlled trials have provided guidance for more effective therapy. These trials have established the need for a lower goal blood pressure (<130/80 mm Hg) than has previously been recommended. In addition, they have proven the efficacy of drugs from three major classes of antihypertensive agents; however, comparative trials have failed to show definite superiority of any particular class in either lowering blood pressure or reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To achieve therapy goals, multiple antihypertensive drugs are usually needed. On the basis of their apparent superiority in slowing diabetic nephropathy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should probably be the first choice. Second and third choices should be a long-acting diuretic and a calcium-channel blocker or a beta-blocker, respectively. Attention should also be directed toward nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic control of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia.",I,8

The primary outcomes were mortality and the combined end point of mortality and morbidity, defined as the incidence of cardiac arrest with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or receipt of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy for at least four hours.; Overall mortality was similar in the two groups. The incidence of the combined end point, however, was 13.2 percent lower with valsartan than with placebo (relative risk, 0.87; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.97; P=0.009), predominantly because of a lower number of patients hospitalized for heart failure; 455 (18.2 percent) in the placebo group and 346 (13.8 percent) in the valsartan group (P<0.001).

Sotalol, amiodarone, and dofetilide have been evaluated for their ability to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. All of these agents are moderately effective; however, amiodarone appears to be most efficacious. Aside from their common class III actions, these agents have profoundly different pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, safety, and drug interaction profiles that help guide drug selection. Amiodarone and dofetilide are safe in patients who have had a myocardial infarction and those with heart failure. The safety of commercially available d,l-sotalol in these patients is poorly understood. Torsades de pointes is the most serious adverse effect of sotalol and dofetilide, and risk increases with renal dysfunction. Amiodarone has minimal proarrhythmic risk but has numerous noncardiac toxicities that require frequent monitoring.

For most people headaches are a nuisance but for some they can be disabling. Two per cent of the population at any time have chronic daily headache, with or without analgesic dependence, but most disabling headaches are intermittent and migranous in nature. Before hoping to make an appropriate intervention, an accurate diagnosis must be made. The first part of this paper examines the differential diagnosis and in particular separates benign from sinister, acute from chronic and tension-type from migranous. The second half focuses on the management of migraine. An individualised approach is usually the most effective, with the patient drawing from the broad areas of attention to trigger factors and lifestyle, finding an acute or rescue medication that consistently returns them to normal activities within a few hours, and prophylaxis to reduce the rate of attack by 50% in those with high frequency migraine. The expession of migraine may well vary during an individual's life and in order to achieve the best lifelong control, adjustment of the blend of management options may be needed. The aim of the adviser is to enable patients to feel in control of their migraine rather than feeling that migraine controls them.",5,E

On the seventh day of each treatment, serial plasma samples were drawn and standardized exercise tests and a 24-hour Holter recording were performed. Metoprolol IR 50 mg produced peak plasma levels comparable to those observed for CR/XL 200 mg (285 v 263 nmol/L). The difference in mean 24-hour heart rate between CR/XL 100 mg and IR 50 mg was 1.0 bpm (95% confidence interval [CI]), -2.9 to 4.9; NS) compared with -3.8 bpm (95% CI, -7.6 to -0.04; P = .048) between CR/XL 200 mg and IR 50 mg. Submaximal exercise heart rate was lower for patients receiving CR/XL 200 mg than those receiving IR 50 mg. No difference in tolerance or exercise performance was observed between treatment regimens.; Peak plasma levels produced by metoprolol 200 mg CR/XL were similar to those of 50 mg IR. Metoprolol CR/XL 200 mg was associated with a more pronounced suppression of heart rate than metoprolol IR 50 mg. It is suggested that patients can safely be switched from multiple dosing of metoprolol IR 50 mg to a once-daily dose of metoprolol CR/XL.",E,E

We have investigated the effect of this functionally active polymorphism on clinical response to beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Two cohorts of untreated hypertensive patients randomly assigned to a beta1-selective beta-blocker at the start of antihypertensive therapy were studied retrospectively to see if the G389R polymorphism influenced the response in terms of blood pressure and heart rate. The blood pressure and heart rate responses to treatment were assessed 4 weeks later and compared with the G389R genotype, ascertained by PCR/restriction fragment length polymorphism. The falls in blood pressure and heart rate for the first group (n = 92) by genotype were: GG, 20.1 +/- 3.5/13.9 +/- 2.7 mmHg (systolic/diastolic blood pressure), 18.4 +/- 2.2 beats/min; GR, 20.0 +/- 2.2/15.0 +/- 1.3 mmHg, 16.5 +/- 1.5 beats/min; RR, 20.8 +/- 2.3/13.4 +/- 1.1 mmHg, 16.0 +/- 1.4 beats/min.

Previous meta-analyses conflict and suggest that CCBs increase myocardial infarction (MI) or protect from stroke.; Standard procedures for meta-analysis were used to analyze three major trials on 21,611 patients and another three lesser studies to a total of 24,322 patients.; Calcium channel blockers have a strikingly similar risk of total and cardiovascular mortality and of major cardiovascular events to conventional therapy. Calcium channel blockers give a lower risk of nonfatal stroke (-25%, p = 0.001) and a higher risk of total MI (18%, p = 0.013), chiefly nonfatal (18%). After performing the Bonferroni correction for multiplicity, these p values become 0.004 and 0.052, respectively. When compared with ACE inhibitors in 1,318 diabetic patients, CCBs had a substantially higher risk of nonfatal (relative risk [RR] = 2.259) and total MI (RR = 2.204, confidence interval 1.501 to 3.238; p = 0.001 or 0.004 with Bonferroni correction). Total and cardiovascular mortality rates are similar. To confirm the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors are superior to CCBs in diabetic patients requires more trial data, especially with renal end points.; Mortality (total and cardiovascular) and major cardiovascular events with CCBs were apparently similar to those events seen with conventional first-line therapy (diuretics or beta-blockers). Stroke reduction more than balanced increased MI. In diabetics, CCBs may be less safe than ACE inhibitors.",I,8

ACE-I effects on total mortality (TM) and arrhythmic mortality (AM) and other composite clinical endpoints have been evaluated. It is well known that frequent ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and a high incidence of sudden death (SD) can be documented in CHF patients; nevertheless a direct relationship between VA, TM, and AM has not been clearly demonstrated; neither beneficial effects, on the same endpoints, of the treatment and suppression of ambient VA in CHF. Conversely, sometimes clear negative effects on both TM and AM have been observed. According to individual studies and two recent complete and large metanalysis, ACE-I were unable to reduce AM, but they reduced TM. Furthermore, they can affect and modify many, if not all, of the triggering factors of VA and SD in this context. Differently from ACE-I, betablockers (BB) have been clearly associated with a reduction in TM and AM, in the same context. Thus, at present time, ACE-I, with or without BB, should be considered the standard therapy in all patients with CHF, if not contraindicated. Angiotensin II antagonists (AII-a) probably represent a comparably effective treatment, in all CHF patients and mainly in those patients, suffering from side effects or showing intolerance to ACE-I, but we are still lacking definitive data from RCTs. In many RCTs, conducted with traditional antiarrhythmic drug therapy (ADT), these drugs have been widely used, contributing probably, in a consistent way, to some of the positive results of these studies. All primary and some secondary implantable defibrillators (ICD) RCTs, in the prevention of SD, have included these drugs as the standard treatment of the underlying cardiac disease, with or without CHF. The same therapeutical strategy is regularly applied in all biventricular pacing (BP) RCTs, with or without the ICD. These trials are supposed to assess the reduction in TM and AM, preventing deterioration or progression of CHF and improving the quality of the patients' s life.Finally, according to these clinical evidences, in the last part of the review, we stress the need for a more widespread implementation of ACE-I and AII-a in treating CHF patients.",E,E

Anger expression was estimated using the anger-out and anger-in scores of the Spielberger Anger Expression Scale. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to estimate the associations of anger expression scores with blood pressure. Proportions of hypertensives among the tertiles of anger expression scores and the relative odds of hypertension for low versus high tertiles of anger expression scales were calculated using logistic regression models.; The anger-out score was inversely associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels for men; a four-point (one standard deviation) lower anger-out score was associated with 1.6 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.6-2.6] greater systolic blood pressure and 0.6 mmHg (95% CI, -0.03 to 1.2) greater diastolic pressure after adjustment for age, body mass index, alcohol intake, smoking category, and parental history of hypertension. The adjusted relative odds of hypertension for low versus high tertiles of anger-out was 1.60 (95% CI, 1.19-2.15). These inverse associations were more evident among men with low coping behavior than among those with high coping behavior. For women, the anger-out score was not associated with blood pressure. There was no relation between the anger-in score and either blood pressure or hypertension in either men or women.; This study suggests that Japanese men who do not express their anger, especially when they have low coping behavior, may have an increased risk of high blood pressure.",E,E

To test the hypothesis that patients previously treated with atenolol could present improvement of vascular structure and endothelial function if they were subjected to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, we crossed over hypertensive patients that had been randomized to treatment with the beta-blocker atenolol to treatment with the AT1 antagonist irbesartan, and studied small artery structure and endothelial function before and after treatment.; Eleven essential hypertensive patients (51 +/- 2 years, range 38-65; 75% male) that had previously been randomized to treatment with atenolol and treated for 1 year with good blood pressure control, were crossed over to treatment with the AT1 antagonist irbesartan for 1 year. Small resistance arteries were dissected from gluteal subcutaneous biopsies that were performed before and after 1 year of treatment.

Following 1 year of treatment, the arterial media width to lumen ratio (M/L) of resistance arteries (lumen diameter, 150-350 microm), which had remained unchanged under atenolol treatment, decreased from 8.44 +/- 0.45% when patients were on atenolol, to 6.46 +/- 0.30%, P < 0.01, when patients received irbesartan. Maximal acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation was 81.1 +/- 4.1% when patients were on atenolol, unchanged from before starting treatment with the beta-blocker, and was normalized by irbesartan (to 94.8 +/- 2.0%, P < 0.01).; Crossing over essential hypertensive patients with well-controlled blood pressure from the beta-blocker atenolol to the AT1 receptor antagonist irbesartan resulted in correction of previously persistently altered vascular structure and endothelial function, suggesting a structural and endothelial vascular protective effect of antihypertensive treatment with the AT1 receptor antagonist.",E,E

For example, the worsening or precipitation of asthma by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is well-recognized, but beta(1)-adrenoceptor blockers that exert mild beta(2)-agonist effects, and those that modulate the endogenous production of nitric oxide, affect airway function to a lesser extent. Therapy with selective alpha(1)-blockers is not contraindicated in cases of chronic airway obstruction. Conversely, alpha(2)-agonists must not be given to asthmatic subjects because they can adversely affect the bronchi. Calcium channel blockers do not exert severe side effects on the airways. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may cause cough and exacerbate or even induce asthma; however, angiotensin II type I (AT(1)) antagonists do not cause cough. 5-Hydroxytryptamine modifiers such as urapidil are a treatment option for patients with chronic airway obstruction. In patients with airway dysfunction, we suggest treatment with thiazide diuretics as the initial drug choice, and calcium channel blockers if the response is poor. In the case of no response, calcium channel blockers alone must be used. However, there is no strict rule because individual patients may respond differently to individual drugs and drug combinations. Consequently, it is important to adopt a flexible approach. For patients who are unresponsive to the aforementioned drugs, AT(1) receptor antagonists, newer beta(1)-adrenoceptor-blocking agents with ancillary properties (eg, celiprolol or nebivolol), and/or vasodilators can be considered.",5,E

A total of 362 patients (186 males and 176 females) developed cardiovascular events. Age (5-year interval) and sex-matched controls were then randomly selected. A Multiple logistic regression analysis was done to control for the effects of confounding factors.

However, as far as stroke was concerned, there was no significant association of risk with the use of any agent. The control group was found to be similar to the case group with respect to the changes in the treatment program during the follow-up period.

Herein it is reported that megalin and cubilin, two epithelial endocytic receptors, mediate the uptake of hemoglobin in renal proximal tubules. Both receptors were purified by use of hemoglobin-Sepharose affinity chromatography of solubilized renal brush-border membranes. Apparent dissociation constants of 1.7 microM for megalin and 4.1 microM for cubilin were determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis. The binding was calcium dependent in both cases. Uptake of fluorescence-labeled hemoglobin by BN-16 cells was inhibited by anti-megalin and anti-cubilin antibodies as well as by receptor-associated protein, a chaperone for LDL-receptor family proteins. Partial inhibition by myoglobin was observed, whereas bovine serum albumin, intrinsic factor-cobalamin complexes, and beta2-microglobulin did not affect the uptake. By use of immunohistochemistry, it was demonstrated that uptake of hemoglobin in proximal tubules of rat, mouse, and dog kidneys occurs under physiologic conditions. Studies on normal and megalin knockout mouse kidney sections showed that megalin is responsible for physiologic clearance of hemoglobin. Labeling intensities in kidneys from normal and cubilin-malexpressing dogs were similar, which suggests that, in the normal state, the role of cubilin in uptake of hemoglobin is rather limited. However, cubilin is likely to assist hemoglobin endocytosis in settings of hemoglobinuria. In conclusion, the study provides a molecular explanation for long-standing observations of hemoglobin uptake in renal proximal tubules that involve the endocytic receptors megalin and cubilin. The findings may prove to be essential for further research on the pathophysiology of hemoglobinuric acute renal failure and proteinuria-associated tubulointerstitial nephritis.",5,E

We developed a prediction rule to help clinicians determine which patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave MI are likely to ""fail"" medical therapy and ultimately require cardiac catheterization within 6 weeks of presentation. Subjects were 733 patients presenting with unstable angina or non-Q-wave MI enrolled in the TIMI IIIB trial and randomized to initial medical management. We developed a prediction rule based on logistic regression analysis of baseline data from history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and blood studies. The outcome of interest was ""failure"" of medical therapy, defined as need for coronary catheterization within 42 days. Significant predictors of ""failing"" medical therapy included ST segment depression >or= .1 mV (odds ratio, OR, = 2.7, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.8-4.1), accelerated angina in the prior 2 months (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.6), nitrate use in the prior week (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.2), exertional angina in the prior 2 months (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.2), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) >or= 0.4 ng/mL (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9). We used these variables to build a risk score by assigning point values based on these ORs. The risk score had a moderate ability to predict which patients would subsequently fail medical therapy and undergo cardiac catheterization (c = 0.682). Out of a total risk score of 13, failure of medical therapy occurred in 86% of patients who had a risk score >or= 8 (n = 111), 78% of patients who had a risk score >or= 6 (n = 240), and 72% of patients who had a risk score >or= 4 (n = 438). At scores of < 2 (n = 88), 40% of patients failed medical therapy. Although the management of unstable angina is in constant evolution, clinicians will always be faced with determining which patients should be managed most invasively. The simple prediction rule we present can be applied to patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave MI at the time of presentation to predict which patients have a high probability of failing medical therapy. Such a rule may be useful for identifying patients who should be considered for early cardiac catheterization.",E,E

Twenty-two hypertensive subjects underwent psychological evaluation and treatment with 1) a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ); 2) an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril; and 3) combined alpha + beta blockade (doxazosin + betaxolol). Anger-Out scores on the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory were positively correlated with the HCTZ-induced fall in systolic blood pressure (p<0.01); Anger-In was negatively correlated with the quinapril-induced fall in systolic pressure (p<0.05). The target systolic blood pressure (130 mm Hg) was achieved with either HCTZ or quinapril in 79% of subjects without, vs. 25% of subjects with, childhood trauma (p=0.03). Responses to doxazosin + betaxolol were not correlated with psychological characteristics. The authors conclude that both inhibited anger expression and childhood trauma are associated with reduced response to a diuretic or ACE inhibitor. Combined alpha/beta blockade may be preferable to an ACE inhibitor or diuretic in treating selected hypertensive patients. Further studies should include examination of psychological factors in terms of the response to combined ACE inhibitor + diuretic therapy.",5,E
11822540,Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs in the treatment of hypertension.,Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Contraindications; Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Hypertension; Risk Factors,"Prichard, B N; Cruickshank, J M; Graham, B R","The reduction in blood pressure seen with the use of beta-blocking drugs was an unexpected finding. Initially there was resistance to their use as the reduction of cardiac output and increase in peripheral resistance from beta-blockade was considered an undesirable pharmacological action for a drug in the treatment of hypertension. However, beta-blockers have now become established in the treatment of hypertension and have been recommended as a first line choice in various guidelines, although their exact mode of action remains a matter for debate. In broad terms beta-blocking drugs are at least of similar efficacy to the other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. They may be usefully combined with other anti-hypertensives, as is often required. There is some evidence that the beta-1 selective agents are more efficacious than the non-selective beta-blockers. Notwithstanding some observations to the contrary beta-blockers are often effective antihypertensive agents in the elderly and in black patients; the combination of being elderly and black, however, appears to result in a reduced fall in blood pressure. If they are given early in pregnancy they lead to a low birth weight. Co-existant disease may influence the choice of a beta-blocker to treat hypertension. Beta-blockers are valuable agents in ischaemic heart disease, notably the control of chronic angina pectoris and to improve prognosis post-myocardial infarction. While initial dose titration has to be extremely careful, heart failure is now a strong indication for the use of a beta-blocker, as prognosis is much improved. Diabetes should no longer be regarded as a contra-indication to the use of a beta-1 selective agent. Recent work confirms that beta-blockers should be given to patients undergoing surgery who have a high cardiac risk. Outcome studies suggest overall that in younger patients beta-blockers reduce the incidence of strokes and myocardial infarction. There is no convincing evidence of a difference between the ACE inhibitor captopril and the combination of diuretic and a beta-blocker. In high risk patients, i.e. those with diabetes, no difference was seen between captopril and atenolol. Diuretics may result in better outcome measurements in the elderly compared to beta-blockade but in combination, ""conventional treatment"" is as effective in terms of total mortality, strokes and myocardial infarction as ACE inhibitors or calcium antagonists. Co-existant asthma remains an important contraindication to beta-blockade, but not chronic obstructive airways disease where a beta-blocker should be used with caution if it is indicated, e.g. post-infarction. Quality of life measurements, at least with beta-1 selective agents compare favourably with other anti-hypertensive drugs. Beta-blockers, without partial agonist activity, should not be stopped abruptly, particularly in patients with, or at high risk of, co-existant ischaemic disease because of the danger of post-beta-blockade cardiac sympathetic hypersensitivity; alternatively bed rest should be instituted to reduce the risk of sympathetic stimulation.",5,E

In animal experiments beta-blockers have also shown an antiatherosclerotic effect. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the beta-blocker metoprolol succinate controlled release/extended release (CR/XL), when given to patients with hypercholesterolemia on concomitant lipid-lowering therapy, provides an additional antiatherosclerotic effect to that provided by the statins, measured as carotid intima-media thickness (IMT).; We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single center trial to compare the effect of metoprolol CR/XL (100 mg once daily) and placebo on the progression of carotid IMT during 36 months of treatment in patients with hypercholesterolemia and signs of early atherosclerosis in the carotid artery. Most patients were prescribed lipid-lowering treatment with statins.; A highly significant difference in the progression rate of the composite variable of carotid bulb IMT+common carotid IMT was observed between the metoprolol CR/XL and placebo groups after 1 year of treatment (-0.08 versus -0.01 mm; P=0.004), an effect that was sustained after 3 years of follow-up (-0.06 versus +0.03 mm; P=0.011). The patients had high levels of total cholesterol at randomization: 9.4 mmol/L in the metoprolol CR/XL group and 8.6 mmol/L in the placebo group. During the study the 2 randomization groups were treated with lipid-lowering drugs, mainly statins, to a similar extent, and total cholesterol was reduced to 6.4 mmol/L at end of follow-up in both groups.; The results from the present study in patients with hypercholesterolemia under concomitant lipid-lowering therapy are the first clinical data to show an antiatherosclerotic effect of beta-blockade as additional therapy to statins. The data indicate that statin treatment and treatment with beta-blockers affect different mechanisms in the atherosclerotic process and have additive beneficial effects.",E,E

We compared the efficacy, safety, and cost of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) versus pharmacologic therapy in preventing variceal rebleeding in patients with advanced cirrhosis. A total of 91 Child-Pugh class B/C cirrhotic patients surviving their first episode of variceal bleeding were randomized to receive TIPS (n = 47) or drug therapy (propranolol + isosorbide-5-mononitrate) (n = 44) to prevent variceal rebleeding. Mean follow-up was 15 months. Rebleeding occurred in 6 (13%) TIPS-treated patients versus 17 (39%) drug-treated patients (P =.007). The 2-year rebleeding probability was 13% versus 49% (P =.01). A similar number of reinterventions were required in the 2 groups; these were mainly angioplasty +/- restenting in the TIPS group (90 of 98) and endoscopic therapy for rebleeding in the medical group (45 of 62) (not significant). Encephalopathy was more frequent in TIPS than in drug-treated patients (38% vs. 14%, P =.007). Child-Pugh class improved more frequently in drug-treated than in TIPS-treated patients (72% vs. 45%; P =.04). The 2-year survival probability was identical (72%). The identified cost of therapy was double for TIPS-treated patients. In summary, medical therapy was less effective than TIPS in preventing rebleeding. However, it caused less encephalopathy, identical survival, and more frequent improvement in Child-Pugh class with lower costs than TIPS in high-risk cirrhotic patients. This suggests that TIPS should not be used as a first-line treatment, but as a rescue for failures of medical/endoscopic treatments (first-option therapies).",E,E

Extensive prospective studies revealed that diuretics, beta-blockers as well as the majority of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce the incidence of complications of hypertension and are therefore considered drugs of first choice in the treatment of hypertension. The additive effects of ACE inhibitors are manifested in particular after larger doses. OBJECTIVE OF TRIAL: To assess the effectiveness and tolerance of the modern long-acting ACE inhibitor--fosinopril--in the treatment of mild and medium severe hypertension and its effect on some anthropometric and laboratory parameters.; Fosinopril as monotherapy in amounts of 10, 20 and 40 mg led to normalization of BP in 85% of the group (n = 203) and was very well tolerated. Only 11% of the group needed a combination with hydrochlorothiazide--12.5 g/day--after which normal BP levels were attained. Only 4% of the patients did not complete the study on account of undesirable effects, incl. 3 patients where cough was the reason for discontinuation. After 12 weeks treatment the systolic BP was reduced on average by 31 mm Hg and the diastolic BP by 16 mm Hg. The heart rate (HR) declined on average by 3 beats/min. (p 0.001). After four weeks treatment a significant decline of the blood sugar level occurred which was even more marked after 12 weeks of treatment (on average by 0.27 mmol/l and at the same time a significant drop of sodium occurred (by 2 mmol/l), of total and LDL-cholesterol (by 0.26 and 0.23 mmol/l). An expected increase of the potassium level occurred (by 0.1 mmol/l) and creatinine (by 3.4 mumol/l in plasma).; Fosinopril treatment with 10-40 mg/day was effective in monotherapy of hypertension in 85% patients and was well tolerated.

In addition, reference lists of published reviews and other trials were reviewed to identify other studies of HRQL and antihypertensive therapy.; A total of 48 articles were included in the review. Results among studies were frequently inconsistent, which is likely due to the wide variety of dimensions studied and instruments used as well as a number of methodological weaknesses, including small sample sizes, short-term assessments, and failure to account for missing data.; A standardized approach to the assessment of HRQL in hypertensive patients is needed so that research in this area can be of value to clinical practice and to hypertensive patients and their families.",5,E

Because the inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake may be expected to increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and pulse rate (PR), a 12-week multi-centre, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sibutramine for weight loss in obese patients whose hypertension was well controlled (DBP < or = 95 mm Hg) by beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta-blockers), with or without concomitant thiazide diuretics. Of the 61 patients randomised to sibutramine 20 mg once daily or placebo, 55 patients (90%) completed the study.

Greater weight reduction on sibutramine was accompanied by trends for greater mean reductions in serum triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Sibutramine was well tolerated, and most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. No sibutramine patient discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. Mean supine and standing DBP and SBP were not statistically significantly different between the sibutramine group and the placebo group at any post-baseline visit during the 12-week trial.

In the present prospective study, 19 previously untreated essential hypertensive patients (aged 47 +/- 2 years, 75% male) were treated for 1 year in a double-blind randomized study with the long-acting calcium channel blocker amlodipine or the beta-blocker atenolol. Resistance arteries (lumen diameter, 150 to 350 microm) dissected from gluteal subcutaneous biopsies were studied on a pressurized myograph. Blood pressure (BP) control (129 +/- 2/85 +/- 2 mm Hg) was identical in both groups for the last 6 months of the study. After 1 year of treatment with amlodipine, the media-to-lumen ratio (M/L) of resistance arteries decreased from 7.89% +/- 0.40% to 6.81% +/- 0.41% (P < .05). Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation tended to improve from 84.3% +/- 5.5% to 90.5% +/- 4.8% (P = .06), whereas sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation was unchanged in the patients treated with amlodipine. In the beta-blocker-treated group there was no significant change in M/L or acetylcholine-induced relaxation. In conclusion, treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine corrected altered resistance artery structure and tended to improve endothelial function in essential hypertensive patients, whereas similar good control of BP with the beta-blocker atenolol did not. Whether the vascular protective effect of amlodipine will result in improved outcomes in hypertension remains to be demonstrated.",E,E

Nevertheless, the independent effect of a widened QRS on mortality rate in congestive heart failure (CHF) is still controversial. Therefore, we carried out this analysis to determine whether LBBB is an independent predictor of mortality in CHF.; We analyzed the large Italian Network on CHF Registry of unselected outpatients with CHF of different causes. The registry was established by the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists in 1995. Complete 1-year follow-up data were available for 5517 patients. The main underlying cardiac diagnosis was ischemic heart disease in 2512 patients (45.6%), dilated cardiomyopathy in 1988 patients (36.0%), and hypertensive heart disease in 714 patients (12.9%). Other causes were recorded in the remaining 303 cases (5.5%). LBBB was present in 1391 patients (25.2%) and was associated with an increased 1-year mortality rate from any cause (hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.41 to 2.05) and sudden death (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 2.06). Multivariate analysis showed that such an increased risk was still significant after adjusting for age, underlying cardiac disease, indicators of CHF severity, and prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers.; LBBB is an unfavorable prognostic marker in patients with CHF. The negative effect is independent of age, CHF severity, and drug prescriptions. These data may support the rationale of randomized trials to verify the effects on mortality rate of ventricular resynchronization with multisite cardiac pacing in patients with CHF and LBBB.",E,E

The aim of the present study was to test this hypothesis.; Nineteen patients with cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia (fewer than thrombocytes 7 x 10(4)/mm3) were include. The subjects of the study. All of them were studied in the morning after an overnight fast. To evaluate splenic arterial hemodynamics, the pulsatility index was measured by Doppler ultrasonography. Platelet counts and platelet-associated immunoglobulin G levels were also recorded. The subjects were then randomized to receive propranolol (n = 10) or placebo (n = 9). The measurements were repeated after 1 week of propranolol or placebo administration. The dose of propranolol was determined so that a 20% to 25% reduction in heart rate was achieved.; Placebo administration caused no significant changes in splenic artery hemodynamics. In contrast, propranolol administration significantly increased the intra splenic artery pulsatility index (from 1.10+/-0.06 to 1.24+/-0.08; P < 0.01).

However, since office blood pressure measurements reflect to a limited extent blood pressure outside the office, a side-arm INSIGHT study in which patients underwent both office measurement and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was also performed.; The study had a randomized, double-blind, parallel group design. After 4 weeks of placebo, mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive patients were randomized to nifedipine GITS 30 mg or amiloride 2.5 + hydrochlorothiazide 5 mg for 3.1 years. Dose titration was performed by dose doubling and addition of atenolol 25-50 mg or enalapril 5-10 mg, or other drugs when needed. Analysis was carried out by intention-to-treat and included computation of 24 h, day and night ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate values. Additional analyses included computation of the trough-to-peak ratio and the smoothness index (the ratio between the average of the 24-hourly blood pressure reductions after treatment and its standard deviation).; A total of 151 patients were recruited and 149 were valid for analysis: 78 patients had 24 h ambulatory recordings both at baseline and during treatment and 134 during treatment. Office, 24 h and day and night blood pressures were all significantly and similarly reduced by both treatments. Office and ambulatory heart rate was left unchanged by diuretics, while it was slightly reduced by nifedipine. Median trough-to-peak ratios were always > 0.5 and superimposable between the two treatment groups. Similarly, smoothness indices of systolic and diastolic blood pressures were comparably high for nifedipine and diuretics, thus demonstrating a similar well-balanced antihypertensive response to both drugs. No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups in the number of cardiovascular events (17 in the nifedipine-based and 26 in the diuretics-based treatment group).; In the INSIGHT study, the long-term antihypertensive effect on 24 h blood pressure and the cardiovascular protection of nifedipine was similar to that of diuretics.",E,E

However, the impact of antihypertensive treatment and LV mass reduction on LV diastolic filling remains unclear.; Echocardiograms were recorded in 728 hypertensive patients with ECG-verified LV hypertrophy (Cornell voltage-duration or Sokolow-Lyon) at baseline and after 1 year of blinded treatment with either losartan or atenolol-based regimen. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) were reduced on average 23/11 mm Hg; isovolumic relaxation time and E/A ratio became more normal, and LV inflow deceleration time prolonged (all P<0.001). Directionally opposite changes in isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and deceleration time indicate improvement in active LV relaxation and passive chamber stiffness during early diastole. Prevalences of normal LV filling increased, abnormal relaxation and pseudonormalization decreased, and restrictive filling pattern remained unchanged (P<0.05). Patients with reduction in LV mass had smaller left atrial diameter, shortened IVRT, increased E/A ratio, and prolonged LV inflow deceleration time (all P<0.001). Patients without LV mass reduction had no change in diastolic filling parameters (P=NS). IVRT shortening was independently associated with reduction in LV mass. Increase in E/A ratio was independently associated with reduction in diastolic BP, and increase in the deceleration time was independently associated with reduced end-systolic relative wall thickness.; Antihypertensive therapy resulting in LV mass or relative wall thickness regression is associated with significant improvement of diastolic filling parameters related to active relaxation and passive chamber stiffness compared with patients without regression, independent of BP reduction; however, abnormalities of diastolic LV filling remain common.",E,E

In very young children, secondary expansion of the globe with damage to anterior segment structures, such as the cornea and zonule, often occurs. Permanent, severe visual dysfunction may result from optic nerve damage as well as from amblyopia arising from anisometropia and corneal opacification. The treatment of childhood glaucoma often involves surgery. Goniotomy and trabeculotomy remain the first line surgical procedures for open-angle glaucoma in children. Trabeculectomy with adjunctive antifibrosis therapy, aqueous shunt surgery, and cyclodestructive procedures are undertaken when angle surgery fails to control the IOP or is unlikely to succeed. The choice of surgical procedure is individualized according to factors such as the age of the patient, the specific type of glaucoma, the number of prior surgical procedures, and the visual potential of the eye. Achieving and maintaining an adequate IOP to prevent progressive optic nerve damage, avoiding complications, and preserving vision are the goals that must be considered in deciding on a surgical plan.",4,E

A large body of knowledge has recently emerged from basic and clinical research concerning the mechanisms of the life-saving effects of beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta-AAs) in high-risk cardiac patients. This article re-emphasizes the mechanisms underlying beta-adrenergic antagonism and also illuminates novel rationales behind the use of perioperative beta-AAs from a biological point of view. Particularly, it delineates new concepts of beta-adrenergic signal transduction emerging from transgenic animal models. The role of the different characteristics of various beta-AAs is discussed, and evidence will be presented for the selection of one specific agent over another on the basis of individual drug profiles in defined clinical situations. The salutary effects of beta-AAs on the cardiovascular system will be described at the cellular and molecular levels. Beta-AAs exhibit many effects beyond a reduction in heart rate, which are less known by perioperative physicians but equally desirable in the perioperative care of high-risk cardiac patients. These include effects on core components of an anaesthetic regimen, such as analgesia, hypnosis, and memory function. Despite overwhelming evidence of benefit, beta-AAs are currently under-utilized in the perioperative period because of concerns of potential adverse effects and toxicity. The effects of acute administration of beta-AAs on cardiac function in the compromised patient and strategies to counteract potential adverse effects will be discussed in detail. This may help to overcome barriers to the initiation of perioperative treatment with beta-AAs in a larger number of high-risk cardiac patients undergoing surgery.",5,E

Prescriptions were collected during May and June 2000 to comprise a study population of 1266 diabetic-hypertensive patients.; As monotherapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (37.9%) and beta-blockers (38.3%) were the most commonly prescribed classes of antihypertensives by FPs and GPs, respectively. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were ranked third by both categories of physicians. For two-drug combinations, a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor was the combination of choice for both physician categories. Patients managed by the FPs were more likely to receive a beta-blocker-CCB combination (17.4 vs. 14.9%) or a diuretic-ACE inhibitor combination (16.7 vs. 11.4%) and less likely to receive a beta-blocker-diuretic combination (11.8 vs. 16.7%) than those managed by the GPs. The proportion of patients receiving antihypertensive combinations was 40.6 and 38.5% for FPs and GPs, respectively. While the GPs prescribed CCB as a monotherapy to the elderly most often, the FPs choice was a beta-blocker. Diuretics were less preferred by both FPs and GPs. Beta-blocker-ACE inhibitor was again the most preferred combination of both FPs and GPs. FPs prescribed CCB-beta-blocker combinations more often than GPs (P = 0.01), whereas CCB-ACE inhibitor combinations were less preferred (P = 0.09). A trend towards excessive use of short-acting nifedipine as monotherapy for elderly patients, both by FPs and by GPs, was noticed. Glibenclamide, alone or in combination with metformin, was the foremost antidiabetic drug prescribed by FPs and GPs. Middle-aged (45-64 years) patients seen by GPs were more likely to receive glibenclamide than those treated by FPs (P = 0.001) and less likely to receive gliclazide (P = 0.01). Combinations of a beta-blocker with either glibenclamide or insulin were prescribed considerably more often by GPs.; Within the same practice setting, a substantial difference was observed between FPs and GPs in terms of preference for different classes of drugs in the management of diabetic hypertension. The compliance of both FPs and GPs was suboptimal; overall, the compliance of the FPs was closer to the recommended guidelines, however. Educational programmes should specifically address these inadequacies in order to improve the quality of health care.",E,E

These 50 patients were placed on a daily one-pill regimen of medication (bendrofluazide, atenolol, or a combination of hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol) and compliance to the regimen was assessed over 12 months using electronic pill containers. Satisfactory compliance was defined as taking the medication on 6 or 7 days a week on average (which corresponds to a mean compliance level of > or = 86%).; In the first month, fewer than half (46%) of the new hypertension patients achieved satisfactory compliance, and only about one-quarter (26%) achieved this level by the twelfth month. Compliance was better among the 23 participants who regularly attended medical follow-up, with nearly three-quarters of these patients (74%) achieving satisfactory compliance during the first month and over one-half (55%) by the twelfth month. There was a direct association between mean 12-month compliance level and having a highly skilled occupation; having good health awareness; and regularly attending medical appointments. In contrast, there was an inverse relationship between mean compliance level and heavy drinking.; The low proportion of people selected from the general population who were capable of sustaining satisfactory compliance to antihypertension medication may correspond to the maximum effectiveness of medication interventions based on a screening and treatment strategy in the general population.

The most marked effects were seen in patients at high risk; the sole study reporting a nonsignificant result enrolled patients with low baseline risk. As a group, studies of perioperative beta-blockade have enrolled relatively few carefully selected patients. In addition, differences in treatment protocols leave questions unanswered regarding optimal duration of therapy.; Despite heterogeneity of trials, a growing literature suggests a benefit of beta-blockade in preventing perioperative cardiac morbidity. Evidence from these trials can be used to formulate an effective clinical approach while definitive trials are awaited.",E,E

Antiepileptic agents have demonstrated efficacy in migraine prevention, and open-label experience from our clinic has suggested that topiramate might be effective for this use. We consequently conducted a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiramate for the preventative treatment of migraine.; Forty patients, aged 19 to 62 years (mean, 38.2 years), were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive topiramate (n = 19; all women) or placebo (n = 21; 20 women, 1 man). Following a prospective baseline phase of 4 weeks, the study drug dose was titrated weekly in 25-mg increments over 8 weeks to 200 mg per day or to the maximum tolerated dose. The titration phase was followed by an 8-week maintenance phase.; During the entire double-blind phase, topiramate-treated patients experienced a significantly lower 28-day migraine frequency (3.31 +/- 1.7 versus 3.83 +/- 2.1; P =.002) compared to placebo, irrespective of use of concomitant migraine prevention medications. The mean 28-day migraine frequency was reduced by 36% in patients receiving topiramate as compared with 14% in patients receiving placebo (P =.004). Twenty-six percent of the patients on topiramate and 9.5% of the patients on placebo achieved a 50% reduction in migraine frequency (P >.05). The mean dose of topiramate was 125 mg per day (range, 25 to 200 mg per day). Topiramate was well tolerated; 2 of 19 topiramate-treated patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Adverse effects that occurred more frequently in topiramate-treated patients included paresthesia, weight loss, altered taste, anorexia, and memory impairment.; Preventative therapy with topiramate significantly reduced migraine frequency. Larger multicenter clinical studies may further delineate the role of topiramate in migraine prevention.",E,E

The angiotensinogen T174M and M235T, the angiotensin-converting enzyme I/D, the AT1-receptor A1166C and the aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) -344 C/T polymorphisms were analysed and related to the change in left ventricular mass (LVM). Patients with the angiotensinogen 174 TM genotype treated with irbesartan responded with the greatest reduction in LVM (-23 +/- 31SD g/m2 for TM and +0.5 +/- 18 g/m2 for TT, P = 0.005), independent of blood pressure reduction. Both the angiotensinogen 235 T-allele (P = 0.02) and the AT1-receptor 1166 AC genotype responded with the greatest reduction in LVM when treated with irbesartan (-0.1 +/- 19 g/m2 for AA and -18 +/- 30 g/m2 for AC, P = 0.02), independent of blood pressure reduction. These polymorphisms were not associated with the change in LVM during treatment with atenolol.; The angiotensinogen T174M and M235T and the AT1-receptor A1166C polymorphisms were related to the change in LVH during antihypertensive treatment with an AT1-receptor antagonist; of these angiotensinogen T174M was the most powerful.

Blood pressure was measured at each visit. 'Best' drug, defined by efficacy and tolerability, was repeated at the end.; Rotation doubled the number of patients reaching target blood pressure (systolic < 140 mmHg) on one drug (P = 0.03). All five drugs were represented among the 'best' drugs. In six patients, the blood pressure on 'best' drug was at least 10 mmHg lower than on any other. Response to the 'best' drug was highly correlated (r = 0.79) with its previous administration. By contrast, there were only weak correlations between responses to pairs of drugs, except for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (A) with beta-blocker (B), and calcium blocker (C) with diuretic (D) - each r = 0.71, P < 0.005). In these young patients, the majority of patients (23/34) responded best to a drug suppressing the renin system (A and B).; Patients vary reproducibly in their response to initial treatment, and switching among drugs can increase the efficacy of monotherapy. The results support an AB/CD scheme for choosing therapy, in which the first drug is taken from one of these pairs, and uncontrolled patients switch to one of the other pair.",E,E

For metoprolol and carvedilol, an increase in ejection fraction has been shown and favorable effects on the myocardial remodeling process have been reported in some studies. We examined the effects of bisoprolol fumarate on exercise capacity and left ventricular volume with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and applied a novel high-resolution MRI tagging technique to determine myocardial rotation and relaxation velocity.; Twenty-eight patients (mean age, 57 +/- 11 years; mean ejection fraction, 26 +/- 6%) were randomized to bisoprolol fumarate (n = 13) or to placebo therapy (n = 15). The dosage of the drugs was titrated to match that of the the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study protocol. Hemodynamic and gas exchange responses to exercise, MRI measurements of left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes and ejection fraction, and left ventricular rotation and relaxation velocities were measured before the administration of the drug and 6 and 12 months later.; After 1 year, heart rate was reduced in the bisoprolol fumarate group both at rest (81 +/- 12 before therapy versus 61 +/- 11 after therapy; P <.01) and peak exercise (144 +/- 20 before therapy versus 127 +/- 17 after therapy; P <.01), which indicated a reduction in sympathetic drive. No differences were observed in heart rate responses in the placebo group. No differences were observed within or between groups in peak oxygen uptake, although work rate achieved was higher (117.9 +/- 36 watts versus 146.1 +/- 33 watts; P <.05) and exercise time tended to be higher (9.1 +/- 1.7 minutes versus 11.4 +/- 2.8 minutes; P =.06) in the bisoprolol fumarate group. A trend for a reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (-54 mL) and left ventricular end-systolic volume (-62 mL) in the bisoprolol fumarate group occurred after 1 year. Ejection fraction was higher in the bisoprolol fumarate group (25.0 +/- 7 versus 36.2 +/- 9%; P <.05), and the placebo group remained unchanged. Most changes in volume and ejection fraction occurred during the latter 6 months of treatment. With myocardial tagging, insignificant reductions in left ventricular rotation velocity were observed in both groups, whereas relaxation velocity was reduced only after bisoprolol fumarate therapy (by 39%; P <.05).; One year of bisoprolol fumarate therapy resulted in an improvement in exercise capacity, showed trends for reductions in end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, increased ejection fraction, and significantly reduced relaxation velocity. Although these results generally confirm the beneficial effects of beta-blockade in patients with chronic heart failure, they show differential effects on systolic and diastolic function.",2,E

Two thousand and four hospital records (50 for each unit) of consecutive patients (< or = 74 years, 21% women) discharged within 6 months before initiation of the study (November 1995) were reviewed and the patients were invited for a follow-up examination from 6 to 9 months after hospital discharge.; The prevalence of patients positive for risk factors reported was: 58.5% for high total cholesterol (> or = 5.2 mmol/l), 46.9% for high blood pressure (> or = 140/90 mmHg), 35.2% for smoking, 20.2% for high blood glucose (> 7 mmol/l), and 14.2% for obesity (body mass index > or = 30 kg/m2). A number of medical records did not provide complete information on risk factors: 24.1% for body mass index, 11.0% for serum cholesterol, and 11.6% for a family history of premature coronary heart disease. Eighty-nine percent of the patients attended the follow-up examination. Their care during the follow-up period was managed by general practitioners (30.5%), cardiologists (37.2%) and/or at hospital outpatient clinics (42.4%). At follow-up examination the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia increased to 62.2%, that of uncontrolled hypertension decreased to 32.2%, and the percentage of smokers decreased to 13.6%. The adherence to the drug treatment prescribed at discharge was as follows: 69.6% for lipid-lowering agents, 81.2% for ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers, and 90.8% for antiplatelet agents. A family history of premature heart disease was reported in 55.1% of patients but screening for coronary heart disease risk factors was extended to relatives in less than 25% of cases.; The prevalence of modifiable risk factors is high in patients with different clinical manifestations of coronary heart disease. The prescriptions for secondary prevention and their efficacy after hospital discharge and the surveying of relatives for primary prevention need to be improved.

However, surgeons may differ in their threshold to operate on patients with different intensities of the same comorbidity, which may not be accounted for using commonly employed risk-adjustment methods. We developed a model to explore the effect that selection based on comorbidity severity could have on estimates of the risk-adjusted relative risk (RR) of operative death. Larger effects on the apparent RR of operative death were observed when both the proportion of patients in the high-risk (""selected"") stratum and the relative increase in the risk of death due to being in the high-risk stratum were large. Biased estimates of the risk-adjusted RR of operative death will be observed if surgeons differentially select patients based on comorbidity severity and if differences in comorbidity severity are not captured by the risk-adjustment methodology.",E,E

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a strong independent indicator of risk of cardiovascular morbidity and death. We aimed to establish whether selective blocking of angiotensin II improves LVH beyond reducing blood pressure and, consequently, reduces cardiovascular morbidity and death.; We did a double-masked, randomised, parallel-group trial in 9193 participants aged 55-80 years with essential hypertension (sitting blood pressure 160-200/95-115 mm Hg) and LVH ascertained by electrocardiography (ECG). We assigned participants once daily losartan-based or atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment for at least 4 years and until 1040 patients had a primary cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke). We used Cox regression analysis to compare regimens.; Blood pressure fell by 30.2/16.6 (SD 18.5/10.1) and 29.1/16.8 mm Hg (19.2/10.1) in the losartan and atenolol groups, respectively.

When previously untreated patients (n=2085) >60 and <60 years of age were assessed separately, supine pulse pressures were consistently higher in the elderly group compared with those of the younger subjects by 6 to 11 mm Hg (P<0.001 to 0.0001). However, while standing, pulse pressures rose in the younger subjects, whereas they tended to fall in the elderly group. After 6 months of beta-blockade, this pattern was unchanged in the younger subjects but reversed into significant rise of pulse pressures in the elderly group by 4 (SD 1) mm Hg (P<0.001). In the patients previously treated with other classes of antihypertensive drugs (n=712), the effects were essentially the same.; In elderly patients with mild hypertension, a depressor trend of pulse pressure while standing can be turned into a significant pressor response by treatment with a beta-blocker.",E,E

For each subject, socioeconomic characterization, family and personal medical history, and information on antihypertensive treatment were obtained through a questionnaire. Blood pressure was measured on a single occasion, and a fasting blood sample was collected. Gender differences in the treatment of arterial hypertension and number and type of drugs were evaluated through the calculation of female:male proportion ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).; Hypertension treatment was more frequent in women than in men (proportion ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.15-1.72), although no differences were observed among hypertensives aware of their condition (proportion ratio 1.07, 95% CI 0.93-1.22). The female:male proportion ratios of treatment with one drug, fixed combination therapy and free combination therapy were 1.13 (95% CI 0.94-1.36), 0.83 (95% CI 0.34-2.01) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.49-1.19), respectively. In subjects treated with one drug the use of ACE inhibitors/AT-II antagonists was more frequent in men (proportion ratio 0.68, 95% IC 0.46-1.01) and treatment with diuretics higher in women (proportion ratio 1.83, 95% CI 1.04-3.23). In participants treated with combination therapy, ACE inhibitors/AT-II antagonists and diuretics were more frequently used by women and calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers by men (female:male proportion ratios were 1.27, 95% CI 0.96-1.68, 1.24, 95% CI 0.94-1.64, 0.61, 95% CI 0.37-1.02 and 0.74, 95% CI 0.31-1.79, respectively).; Arterial hypertension tended to be more frequently treated among women and different therapeutic options were found according to gender. Gender differences in the awareness of hypertension, sexual specificity of the activity of antihypertensive drugs, and comorbidity may play a role in gender inequalities in the treatment of hypertension in Portugal.",1,E

Continuous search for prognostic factors as well as treatment methods influencing a prognosis coming from clinical effects of applied prescriptions and survival in the mentioned group of patients can be observed in many published reports. In the presented work a retrospective analysis has been performed with regard to 106 patients with severe heart lesion: 72 cases with ischaemic disease, 20 cases with post-inflammation heart lesion, 7 cases with hypertension and 7 cases with idiopathic congestive cardiomyopathy. The main criterion including particular patient into the group under analysis was less or equal to 30% ejection fraction confirmed by echocardiographical examination and generally understand heart insufficiency in the clinical examination and laboratory tests. The observation period concerning patients qualified to the analyzed group incorporated 36 +/- 16.5 months. Influence of the parameters obtained from clinical, electrocardiographical, Holter monitoring, chest X-Ray, and serum concentration of both sodium (Na) and potassium (K) have been analyzed. Also the survival analysis has been performed for patients treated: according standard procedures, with addition of beta-adrenolytic drug, with addition of amiodaron, with addition of combination of both beta-adrenolytic drug and amiodaron. During the observation 64 patients have died (60%), 4 patients have had heart transplantation (Htx) performed (4%) and 38 patients survived without necessity of Htx (36%). Among investigated parameters there were following ones which proved their statistical significance in terms of prognosis evaluation: ejection fraction, features of pulmonary haemostasis, HR (heart rate), SBP (systolic blood pressure), serum concentration of both sodium (Na) and potassium (K). Much better therapy effects as well as longer survival have concerned patients with hypertension disease confirmed during the anamnesis. Comparison of the survival curves referring to the patients treated according to different schemes a positive trend in the direction of survival improvement has been observed. This trend however appeared in the group treated additionally with beta-blocker and only in the outpatient follow-up. On the other hand a combination of both beta-blocker and amiodaron has been connected with improved both early and outpatient follow-up survival. The survival curves for patients treated with amiodaron only has been quite similar as in the case of patients treated according standard procedures. Addition of beta-adrenolytic drug or amiodaron or eventually both of these medicines has a significant influence into decrease of repeated hospitalizations in the group under investigation.",1,E

In 92% of the 120 patients referred for cardiac transplantation evaluation, drug therapy could be optimized. A considerable number of patients could be subjected to an organ-preserving intervention or surgery, either PTCA (n=11), CABG (n=4), valve repair (n=7), multisite pacing (n=7), or partial ventricular resection (n=5). Only a small group of patients with the worst heart failure survival score were listed for heart transplantation (n=17) or received a ventricular assist device (n=3).; within a contemporary cohort of advanced heart failure patients, only a small number of patients will undergo cardiac transplantation, which is predictable by the heart failure survival score.

In previous studies of human hypertension, interruption of the renin-angiotensin system corrected small artery structure and endothelial dysfunction, whereas the beta-blocker atenolol did not. We hypothesized that the AT(1)R antagonist losartan, but not the beta-blocker atenolol, would reduce stiffness of gluteal subcutaneous small arteries in essential hypertensive patients. Seventeen untreated mild essential hypertensive patients (47+/-2 years; 75% male) were randomly assigned in double-blind fashion to losartan or atenolol treatment for one year. Small, resistance size arteries were studied on pressurized myographs. Blood pressure (mmHg) was reduced (p<0.01) from 145 +/- 4/101 +/- 2 and 147 +/- 6/98 +/- 2 to 128 +/- 4/86 +/- 2 and 131 +/- 3/84 +/- 1 by losartan and atenolol, respectively. The media/lumen ratio of small arteries was unaffected by atenolol (8.3+/-0.3% before and 8.8+/-0.5% after treatment). In contrast, losartan reduced media/lumen ratio from 8.4+/-0.4% to 6.7+/-0.3% (p<0.01). Whereas isobaric elastic modulus was unaffected by either treatment, geometry-independent stiffness (slope of elastic modulus vs. stress) was reduced from 9.7+/-1.2 to 6.1+/-0.9 (P<0.05) under losartan treatment, but was unchanged by atenolol (8.2+/-1.3 to 7.8+/-0.6).

Verapamil, a phenylalkylamine, is useful in the treatment of hypertension, stable angina, and narrow QRS supraventricular arrhythmias. This calcium antagonist is effective in both young and old, and both black and white hypertensive patients, and is free of metabolic side effects. Verapamil has a well-documented history as an effective antianginal agent when directly compared with a beta-blocker, and is more effective in reducing myocardial ischemia compared with amlodipine monotherapy. Because of the short half-life of verapamil, drug delivery systems are used to prolong the duration of action. Novel drug delivery systems using encapsulated beads or a modified osmotic pump have been designed to be taken at nighttime to provide maximal blood pressure reduction in the early morning hours and effective 24-hour blood pressure control, and to avoid excessive blood pressure reduction during sleep. The Verapamil in Hypertension and Atherosclerosis Study has documented equivalent effectiveness of verapamil compared with chlorthalidone, but showed superior plaque regression and reduced events in subjects with the greatest plaques with verapamil treatment. The Angina Prognosis Study in Stockholm, comparing verapamil and metoprolol for stable angina, found no difference in total cardiovascular mortality or combined cardiovascular events. Other large ongoing randomized, multicenter trials, including Controlled-Onset Verapamil Investigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints and the International Verapamil-Trandolapril Study, will expand our knowledge of the role of verapamil in the treatment of hypertension.",I,8

Many of the antiglaucoma medications, when systemically absorbed, affect the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems of patients and can cause cardiovascular toxicity. Such adverse effects are frequently associated with the long-term use of potentially toxic agents in elderly people, who are most prone to chronic eye disease. Moreover, patients may not associate their symptoms with the topical eye medications, and consequently may not report adverse drug effects. Drug-drug interactions can also occur when patients are taking medications for both cardiovascular disease and glaucoma. This review focuses on beta-adrenergic blockers as topical antiglaucoma medications and other topical antiglaucoma drugs. The systemic toxicity of these agents is reviewed, along with the possible drug interactions.

Patients who died of CV causes had lower total power and high (HF), low (LF), and very low (VLF) frequency components of HRV. HRV was not altered in patients who suffered non-fatal MI. Catecholamines did not differ between patients with and those without events. Metoprolol increased HRV. Verapamil decreased noradrenaline (norepinephrine) excretion. Multivariate Cox analyses showed that total power, HF, LF, and VLF independently predicted CV death (also non-sudden death) but not MI. LF:HF ratios and catecholamines were not related to prognosis. Treatment effects on HRV did not influence prognosis.; Low HRV predicted CV death but not non-fatal MI. Neither the LF:HF ratio nor catecholamines carried any prognostic information. Metoprolol and verapamil influenced LF, HF, and catecholamines differently but treatment effects were not related to prognosis.",E,E

Early retrospective studies implicated reserpine in breast cancer, but data from prospective studies and meta-analysis of several case-controlled studies showed only a weak association between reserpine and breast cancer which, although statistically significant, is of little clinical concern. Data from case-controlled studies and several cohort studies suggested an association between the use of a diuretic and the occurrence of renal cell cancer, particularly in women. A recent study showed an association between the use of a diuretic and the occurrence of colon cancer. Several prospective studies showed that treatment with atenolol may increase mortality from malignancy. However, other studies that analyzed data from several thousand patients could not confirm this association. In three prospective and a few case-controlled studies, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were not associated with increased mortality from malignancy. In addition, a recent retrospective study showed that long-term use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors had a protective effect against malignancy. Data from three large case-controlled studies and the combined data from eight randomized controlled studies and seven longitudinal studies showed a similar risk for malignancy among users and nonusers of calcium antagonists. Until further data from prospective clinical trials are available, we advise caution about long-term diuretic therapy in women. With regard to other antihypertensive drug classes, we suggest continuing the management of hypertension according to current treatment guidelines with little fear of any substantial cancer risk.",I,E

Silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) is an important predictor of adverse outcome in patients with proven coronary artery disease. beta-blockers are effective in suppressing ischemia, and improve clinical outcome in patients with coronary artery disease. At present, it is common practice to stop treatment with beta-blockers in clinically asymptomatic patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and/or myocardial re-vascularization (PTCA/Stent), although the possible presence of SMI/inducible ischemia after myocardial re-vascularization is not known. We examined 56 asymptomatic CHD patients after coronary artery bypass graft (n=36), percutaneous coronary angioplasty PTCA/stent (n=15), or both (n=5); therapy with beta-blockers was stopped in all of them after myocardial revascularization. All these patients underwent a dobutamine stress echocardiography test (DSE test). The DSE test was proposed to these asymptomatic CHD patients to investigate the possible presence of SMI/inducible ischemia after myocardial re-vascularization. All patients had history of myocardial infarction or evidence of mildly impaired left ventricular function at rest as assessed by cardiac catheterization. Abnormal DSE studies occurred in eight of the 56 patients (14%; 95% C.I.: 6-26%). Therapeutic approaches specifically targeted at reducing total ischaemic burden include pharmacologic therapy and myocardial revascularization. On the basis of these data, it can be concluded that asymptomatic CHD patients after myocardial re-vascularization must be re-evaluated to rule out SMI/inducible ischemia that can be treated (e.g. with beta-blockers) reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",E,E

The cumulative incidence of initiation of migraine-prophylactic drugs (beta-blockers, serotonin antagonists, specific calcium antagonists, amitriptyline, clonidine and valproic acid) was estimated in patients following the use of ergotamine or a triptan. An assessment of the migraine-prophylactic drug of first choice was also performed. A few baseline determinants were analysed to highlight a possible association with the initiation of prophylactic therapy: age, gender, type of abortive migraine drug use and year of prophylaxis. Additional determinants included the analysis of drug-utilisation patterns, such as the consumption and switch patterns of abortive migraine drug use as well as co-medication use prior to prophylaxis. For this particular analysis a reference group (patients not having commenced prophylaxis) was selected from the initial study population.; After having satisfied eligibility criteria, a total of 3999 first-time users of ergotamine and triptans were included of whom 479 (12%) had initiated migraine-prophylactic therapy. This corresponded to an incidence density of 6.0 per 100 person-years and was highest for patients younger than 45 years and for multiple abortive migraine drug users. The incidence fell considerably from 12.0 person-years in 1994 to 5.1 person-years in 1998. More than half of the patients had been prescribed a beta-blocker as the migraine-prophylactic drug of first choice by both general practitioners and neurologists. The use of antidepressants and/or benzodiazepines and oral contraceptives was significantly higher in patients starting prophylaxis compared with those who did not. The consumption of abortive migraine drug use (4.0 defined daily doses per month vs 3.7 defined daily doses per month), and switch patterns (27.1% vs 30.9%) were similar for patients starting and not starting prophylaxis.; The overall incidence of initiation of migraine-prophylactic therapy following the use of abortive migraine analgesics was 6.0% per year and fell considerably during 5 years of the study. Beta-blockers were the migraine-prophylactic drugs of first choice for general practitioners and neurologists. In our study we could not determine any factors clearly associated with the initiation of migraine prophylaxis besides prior use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines. A future assessment of the usage patterns of migraine-prophylactic drugs may provide detailed information concerning the effectiveness and tolerability.",I,8

The inotropic effect is mediated by calcium concentration-dependent conformational changes in troponin C during systole leading to sensitization of the contractile apparatus to calcium ions. The vasodilator effect is mediated by opening potassium channels on vascular smooth muscle. It has a complex pharmacokinetic profile, with a long-acting metabolite that has hemodynamic effects persisting for approximately 1 week. Although it is absorbed orally, it has been developed only for intravenous use thus far. The hemodynamic effects are not reduced and may be enhanced in the presence of beta-blockers, possibly an important attribute when dealing with exacerbation of heart failure caused by or in the presence of beta-blockers. More patients with heart failure have participated in randomized controlled trials of levosimendan than of any other intravenous inotropic agent. Experience with its use after cardiac surgery is limited. Preliminary observations suggest that hemodynamic changes are associated with symptomatic benefit and a reduction in morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction, compared with placebo in one study and dobutamine in another. Levosimendan may be the first inotropic agent that it is both safe and effective in altering clinical outcomes relevant for patients. Part of this benefit may be achieved because levosimendan allows other inotropic agents that may have adverse effects on patient outcome to be avoided. Further research is required to confirm whether levosimendan reduces mortality and morbidity compared with a placebo and when administered repetitively. If it does, it may become routine therapy for the treatment of severe heart failure.",E,E

One of the putative mechanisms for the salutary effects of beta-blockers on sudden death mortality in heart failure is their ability to suppress ventricular arrhythmias. However, supporting data in patients with CHF are sparse, especially in the setting of excessive neurohumoral activation associated with symptomatic decompensated heart failure.; We studied 236 patients (159 men; mean age, 61 +/- 14 years) admitted for decompensated CHF. Fifty patients were receiving beta-blockers at the time of the study. The severity of ventricular arrhythmia was assessed by 24-hour Holter recordings by using several prospectively defined measures of ventricular ectopy. All measures of ventricular ectopy were lower in patients receiving beta-blockers. The average hourly total premature ventricular beats (PVCs), hourly ventricular couplets, repetitive PVCs, and frequency of ventricular tachycardia episodes were 15% (P =.02), 75% (P <.05), 72% (P <.05), and 87% (P =.01) lower in patient receiving beta-blockers, respectively. In a multivariate regression analysis, the negative relationship between beta-blockers and the average hourly PVCs (P =.03), the frequency of ventricular pairs (P =.03), repetitive PVCs (P <.05), and ventricular tachycardia episodes (P =.01) remained significant and independent.; Concomitant beta-blocker therapy during heart failure decompensation is associated with a marked reduction in complex ventricular ectopy and episodes of ventricular tachycardia. This effect of beta-blockers may play an important protective role by preventing serious ventricular arrhythmias during transient increases in sympathetic activity.",E,E

Hypertension represents an imbalance of hemodynamic forces within the circulation, usually characterized by elevated systemic vascular resistance. We studied the utility of serial hemodynamic parameters in the selection and titration of antihypertensive medication in resistant hypertensive patients using highly reproducible noninvasive measurements by thoracic bioimpedance. Resistant hypertension patients (n=104) were randomized to drug selection based either on serial hemodynamic (HD) measurements and a predefined algorithm or on drug selection directed by a hypertension specialist (SC) in a 3-month intensive treatment program. Blood pressure was lowered by intensified drug therapy in both treatment groups (169+/-3/87+/-2 to 139+/-2/72+/-1 mm Hg HD versus 173+/-3/91+/-2 to 147+/-2/79+/-1 mm Hg SC, P<0.01 for systolic and diastolic BP), using similar numbers and intensity of antihypertensive medications. Blood pressures were reduced further for those treated according to hemodynamic measurements, resulting in improved control rates (56% HD versus 33% SC controlled to </=140/90 mm Hg, P<0.05) and incremental reduction in systemic vascular resistance measurements. Although the number of patients taking diuretics did not differ between groups, final diuretic dosage was higher in the hemodynamic cohort. Our results demonstrate superior blood pressure control using a treatment algorithm and serial hemodynamic measurements compared with clinical judgment alone in a randomized prospective study. Our measurements of thoracic fluid volume support occult volume expansion as a mediator of antihypertensive drug resistance and use of impedance measurements to guide advancing diuretic dose and adjustment of multidrug antihypertensive treatment.",E,E

In all patients, LVEF, peak oxygen consumption (peakVO(2)), plasma norepinephrine (NE) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were determined.; Although the New York Heart Association functional class (2.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.7), peakVO(2) (14.4 +/- 5.2 ml/min per kg vs. 14.4 +/- 5.5 ml/min per kg) and NT-proBNP (337 +/- 360 pmol/l vs. 434 +/- 538 pmol/l) were similar in the groups with and without beta-blocker treatment, the group with beta-blocker treatment had a lower heart rate (68 +/- 30 beats/min vs. 76 +/- 30 beats/min), lower NE (1.7 +/- 1.2 nmol/l vs. 2.5 +/- 2.2 nmol/l) and higher LVEF (24 +/- 10% vs. 21 +/- 9%; all p < 0.05). Within one year, 34% of patients without beta-blocker treatment, but only 16% of those with beta-blocker treatment (p < 0.001), reached the combined end point, defined as hospital admission due to worsening CHF and/or cardiac death. A beneficial effect of beta-blocker treatment was most obvious in the advanced stages of CHF, because the end-point rates were markedly lower (all p < 0.05) in the group with beta-blocker treatment versus the group without it, as characterized by peakVO(2) <10 ml/min per kg (26% vs. 64%), LVEF < or = 20% (25% vs. 45%), NE >2.24 nmol/l (18% vs. 40%) and NT-proBNP >364 pmol/l (27% vs. 45%), although patients with beta-blocker treatment received only 37 +/- 21% of the maximal recommended beta-blocker dosages.; The prognostic value of variables used for risk stratification of patients with CHF is markedly influenced by beta-blocker treatment. Therefore, in the beta-blocker era, a re-evaluation of the selection criteria for heart transplantation is warranted.",E,E

It enrolled, at health centres in Norway and Sweden, 10 881 patients aged 50-74 years who had diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 100 mmHg or more. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP were decreased by 20.3/18.7 mmHg in the diltiazem group and by 23.3/18.7 mmHg in the diuretic/beta-blocker group - a significant difference in SBP (P < 0.001).; The incidence of the primary endpoint - a composite of cardiovascular death, cerebral stroke and myocardial infarction - was similar for the two treatments.

Despite advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of migraine and new effective treatment options, migraine remains an under-diagnosed, under-treated and poorly treated health condition. Most patients will unsuccessfully attempt to treat their headaches with over-the-counter medications. Few well designed, placebo-controlled studies are available to guide physicians in medication selection. Recently published evidence-based guidelines advocate migraine-specific drugs, such as serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists (the 'triptans') and dihydroergotamine mesylate, for patients experiencing moderate to severe migraine attacks. Additional headache attack therapy options include other ergotamine derivatives, phenothiazines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and opioids.

Most medications used to treat glaucoma are in topical eyedrop form and may cause numerous untoward systemic effects in older persons. In recent years, several new ocular hypotensive medications have become available. These medications are being used more commonly because there is a growing trend by ophthalmologists to aggressively lower intraocular pressure. Therefore, geriatricians require a comprehensive knowledge of medications used to treat glaucoma, in addition to an understanding of their mechanism of action profiles of untoward effects and possible interactions with other diseases or medications. Therefore, we performed a review of the medications recently introduced into clinical practice. We selected drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration between 1996 and September 2001. The safety profiles of these agents and their untoward side effects were reviewed by class: topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (brinzolamide: ocular tolerance, taste perversion), beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (timolol: bradycardia and bronchospasm), alpha-adrenergic agonists (brimonidine: oral dryness, headache, and fatigue), and prostaglandin analogs (latanoprost, bimatoprost, travoprost, and unoprostone isopropyl: ocular hyperemia, iris color changes). The function of this review is to make geriatricians more aware of the efficacy and untoward effects of medications recently introduced into clinical practice. We recommend that geriatricians perform a medication review on all medications their patients use, including eye drops.",4,E

In both uni- and multivariate analysis, the heart-mediastinum ratio of 123I-MIBG uptake did not correlate with cardiovascular mortality. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, plasma norepinephrine, peak oxygen consumption, end-diastolic volume as measured by echocardiography and exercise performance during bicycling and walking had prognostic significance in patients with heart failure treated with beta blockers in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",E,E

Low dose dobutamine echocardiography (DSE), a 6-min walk test and measured brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were assessed in all the patients. Patients were separated into two groups. Group A were patients without any myocardial reserve and group B patients with a myocardial contractile reserve defined as an increment of more than 20% of the resting left ventricular ejection fraction during dobutamine infusion. The two groups differed for percentage of ischemic cardiomyopathy (67.8 in group A vs. 29.7% in group B P = 0.028), 6-min walk test performance (respectively, 343 vs. 415 meters P < 0.05) and BNP plasma levels (respectively, 184.5 vs. 70.1 P < 0.02) but not for left ventricular ejection fraction or NYHA class. During DSE, MCR and heart rate variation was higher in group B than in group A. At the end of the follow up, LVEF increased and NYHA class decreased in group B but not in group A. In multivariate analysis the existence of MCR could predict the improvement of LVEF with treatment by carvedilol. In our study, studying MCR could help to predict patients who will improve their LVEF with carvedilol prior to the administration of the treatment.",E,E

Carvedilol is an adrenoceptor antagonist, which inhibits beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. Carvedilol has additional metabolic and antioxidant properties. Metoprolol is a selective antagonist of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors. The carvedilol or metoprolol European trial (COMET) is the first study to investigate whether beta-blocking agents with differing pharmacological profiles exert different effects on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. 3029 patients from 15 different European countries were enrolled into COMET and will be followed until 1020 fatal events have been observed, unless the data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC) recommends early termination. The target dose for carvedilol is 25 mg bid and for metoprolol tartrate 50 mg bid. This manuscript outlines the rationale, design and possible outcomes of COMET.",I,8

Using pre-determined criteria, ten randomised, controlled trials that assessed the effects of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) on CV events in patients with hypertension were identified. Six of them enrolled a relatively small number (< 1500) of hypertensive patients, whereas four of the studies were much larger (> 4500 patients). The smaller studies produced mixed findings, especially those trials where CCBs were compared with diuretics; this may reflect methodological limitations and the impact of random error. The results from the four larger studies produced a consistent message: long-acting CCBs such as nifedipine, administered in a gastro-intestinal-transport-system (GITS) formulation, nitrendipine and diltiazem, reduce CV morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. In the one study that specifically enrolled high-risk hypertensive patients, nifedipine GITS was as effective as diuretic therapy in reducing CV events, and in all four larger studies sub-group analyses showed that the benefits of these CCBs extend to hypertensive patients with diabetes. The available evidence supports the use of these long-acting CCBs as a first-line treatment option in hypertensive patients.",E,E

Twenty-four hour diurnal curve intraocular pressure (IOP) testing was performed following each period.; Thirty-six patients completed this study. There was a significant reduction at each time point in the 24-hour diurnal curve of both evening (17.1 +/- 2.7 mm Hg) and morning (17.3 +/- 3.1 mm Hg) dosed latanoprost/timolol maleate compared with timolol maleate given twice daily (21.1 +/- 3.3 mm Hg) (P <.0001). When the morning and evening dosing groups were compared directly, the 06:00 time point was statistically lower with evening dosing (16.4 +/- 2.3 mm Hg) vs morning dosing (17.9 +/- 2.8 mm Hg) (P =.01). Overall, a trend existed for greater daytime reduction with night-time dosing of the concomitant therapy, whereas morning dosing tended to give lower night-time pressures. There was a significantly lower mean range of diurnal pressure with evening (3.6 mm Hg) vs morning (4.3 mm Hg) dosing (P =.02). No differences in adverse events existed between the treated arms.; This study suggests that latanoprost and timolol maleate, both given once daily in the morning or evening, effectively reduce the IOP for the 24-hour diurnal curve when compared with timolol maleate twice daily.",6,E

A retrospective analysis of information recorded in the drugs database of the Local Health Unit of Ravenna (Italy) was carried out on 7312 subjects receiving a first prescription for diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists between 1 January and 31 December 1997. Patients were followed up for 3 years. All prescriptions of antihypertensive drugs filled during the follow-up periods were considered. The patients continuing or discontinuing the initial treatment, the duration of treatment, and the doses taken were all calculated, as well as main factors influencing the persistence rate. The drugs prescribed were predominantly ACE-inhibitors, followed by calcium channel blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers and angiotensin II antagonists. A total of 57.9% of patients continued their initial treatment during the 3-year follow-up period, 34.5% discontinued the treatment, whilst 7.6% were restarted on a treatment in the third year. Persistence with treatment was influenced by: age of patient (persistence rate increasing proportionately with advancing years), type of drug first prescribed (persistence rate higher with angiotensin II antagonists, progressively lower with ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics), gender of patient (persistence was better in males), age of general practitioner (GP) (the younger the GP, the better the persistence rate) and gender of GP (better stay-on-therapy rate with male GP prescribing). In the case of patients treated continuously, mean daily dose increased progressively over the 3 years. With adequate markers, helpful data can be collected from prescription claims databases for the purpose of monitoring the persistence of patients in continuing their medication, and the quality of antihypertensive treatment in a general practice setting.",E,E

Clinical parameters (ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and modified Ross score) were assessed before initiation of treatment and monthly for 6 months. Pharmacokinetic profiles of carvedilol were determined over the first 12-hour period after the initial dose in study patients, and for comparison, in 9 healthy adult volunteers.; Fifteen patients (aged 6 weeks to 19 years) were enrolled in the study, including 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 5 with CHF secondary to congenital heart disease. All 15 patients tolerated carvedilol for the duration of the trial, and all achieved maximum target dosing. After 6 months of carvedilol therapy, ejection fraction increased (36% vs 54%; P <.05) and modified Ross Score improved (5 +/- 2 vs 3 +/- 3; P <.05). Elimination half-life was about 50% shorter in pediatric CHF patients compared with healthy adult volunteers (2.9 vs 5.2 hours; P <.05).; Pediatric patients with CHF not responding to standard therapy may benefit from oral carvedilol treatment. The observed increased elimination of carvedilol in children suggests that optimal dosing strategies need to be further defined among the pediatric population.",E,E

The study comprised a 2-week single-blind placebo screening period, a 6-week double-blind dose titration period, a 4-week double-blind dose maintenance period, and a 2-week double-blind dose-tapering period. One hundred and forty subjects were enrolled to achieve 94 randomized subjects treated either with B/HT ( n=62) or placebo ( n=32).

The placebo-subtracted BP reductions were greater in younger children and those with more-severe baseline hypertension. The percentage of subjects with BP less than the 90th percentile at study completion was 45% for B/HT and 34% for placebo ( P=NS). Although the study demonstrated that B/HT reduced BP safely compared with placebo, the large placebo effect and failure of most subjects to achieve target BP control make it uncertain whether B/HT is appropriate first-line therapy for pediatric hypertension, particularly in adolescents with mild-to-moderate BP elevation.",E,E

A total of 808 subjects were treated in a treatment period of 16 weeks. 142 subjects discontinued the trial prematurely, mainly because of adverse events (n=58). The mean attack frequency in the double-blind period was 2.0 for the FLU 5 mg group, 1.9 for the FLU 10 mg group, and 1.9 for the propranolol group. The mean attack frequency in the last 28 days of the double-blind period was 1.8 for FLU 5 mg, 1.6 for FLU 10 mg, and 1.7 for propranolol. Both flunarizine groups were at least as effective as propranolol (P<0.001 in one-sided test). The percentage of responders (defined as subjects for whom attack frequency decreased by at least 50% compared to run-in) in the last 28 days of the double-blind period was 46% (118/259) for FLU 5 mg, 53% (141/264) for FLU 10 mg, and 48% (125/258) for propranolol. Statistical analysis showed that FLU 10 mg is at least as effective as propranolol (P<0.001) and showed a trend for noninferiority of FLU5 and propranolol (P=0.053). No statistically significant differences between the treatment groups were found for any of the secondary parameters. Overall, 190 subjects reported one or more adverse events during the run-in phase: 54 (20.5%) in the FLU 5 mg group, 76 (27.7%) in the FLU 10 mg group and 60 (22.3%) in the propranolol group. The results of this equivalence trial show that 10 mg flunarizine daily with a drug-free weekend is at least as effective as 160 mg propranolol in the prophylaxis of migraine for all evaluated parameters (one-sided equivalence tests) after 16 weeks of treatment. In addition, 5 mg flunarizine proves to be at least as effective as 160 mg propranolol when looking at the mean attack frequency for both the whole double-blind period and the last 28 days of treatment. However, in the analysis of responders, 160 mg propranolol seems to be slightly better than 5 mg flunarizine.

We are at a loss to explain why the pathophysiological mechanisms of obesity and hypertension are so inextricably intertwined. Adding to this frustration is the inadequacy of the treatment for obesity. Hemodynamically, we recognize that the expanded plasma volume caused by obesity imparts a significant volume overload on the heart, thereby increasing cardiac output, while the hypertension compounds this ventricular stress by an associated pressure overload. Thus, the ventricle has an eccentric as well as a concentric adaptive hypertrophy. Associated with obesity is an increased burden of pressor (e.g., catecholamine, angiotensin II); peptide (e.g., endothelin, insulin, leptin, natriuretic); hormonal (e.g., growth, steroids, thyroid); and neural mechanisms. Further complicating these alterations are electrolytic, lipid, uric acid, and other metabolic factors. Both diseases (obesity and hypertension) are exacerbated by frequently encountered comorbid pathophysiological disorders including atherosclerosis, ventricular dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemias, and sleep apnea. To add to these issues, therapy for obesity-hypertension is suboptimal. Behavioral modification (of overweight and obesity) is commonly characterized by recidivism, and pharmacotherapy of obesity is woefully inadequate; the present agents either raise arterial pressure or are fraught with adverse effects. Fortunately, there are no contraindications imparted by obesity that complicate the drug treatment of the associated hypertension. Each of the lifestyle modifications and seven classes of antihypertensive therapy that is discussed herein is done in light of the coexistent hypertension and comorbid diseases.",5,E

After adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, prior heart failure, prior angina, delay to hospitalization, site of infarction, drug therapy with aspirin, beta-blockers, streptokinase and hyperlipidaemia and treated hypertension, Type 2 diabetes was still associated with a 40% higher death rate compared with people without diabetes (P < 0.05) There was no significant difference in death rates in those aged over 70 years, but an indication of a trend in younger individuals with a four-fold increase in death rate in those with diabetes aged < 60 years, compared with a rate ratio of 2.6 in those with diabetes aged 61-70 years.; Among hospitalized patients with first acute myocardial infarction, Type 2 diabetes mellitus is consistently associated with increased mortality and increased hospital admission for heart failure. The estimated 4-year survival rate is only 50%. Our results indicate that younger subjects with Type 2 diabetes and acute myocardial infarction are a high-risk group deserving of special study, and support the argument for aggressive targeting of coronary risk factors among patients with Type 2 diabetes.",E,E

Using dynamic positron emission tomography, myocardial perfusion at rest and perfusion reserve after dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg/min) were measured. Myocardial glucose uptake and plasma levels of catecholamines were also estimated. Carvedilol treatment reduced the rate-pressure product (8,781 +/- 2,672 vs 6,342 +/- 1,346, p <0.01) and improved ejection fraction (29 +/- 7% vs 37 +/- 11%, p <0.001), whereas no changes were observed in the control group. Perfusion at rest was unchanged in the placebo group (0.81 +/- 0.17 vs 0.86 +/- 0.23 ml/g/min, p = NS), whereas the carvedilol-treated group showed a significant reduction (0.88 +/- 0.26 vs 0.75 +/- 0.16 ml/g/min, p <0.05). Dipyridamole-induced hyperemia was significantly reduced after carvedilol treatment (1.51 +/- 0.45 vs 1.31 +/- 0.51 ml/g/min, p <0.001), whereas myocardial perfusion reserve was unaltered. Carvedilol did not alter myocardial glucose uptake (0.33 +/- 0.14 vs 0.32 +/- 0.12 micromol/g/min, p = NS) or the plasma catecholamines levels. We therefore conclude that in patients with congestive heart failure, carvedilol reduced resting and hyperemic perfusion. No effect on glucose uptake or catecholamine levels was observed. The reduced perfusion at rest must reflect reduced perfusion demand and thereby a higher threshold for myocardial ischemia and protection against myocardial damage or malignant arrhythmia. These effects may serve as a pathophysiologic explanation for the reduced mortality in patients with congestive heart failure who receive carvedilol.",E,E

The first study analyzed the correlation between serum HGF concentration and clinical arterial stiffness or the vasodilator response to reactive hyperemia in hypertensive patients. The second study investigated the correlation between changes in serum HGF concentration and clinical arterial stiffness or reactive hyperemia during treatment with cilazapril or atenolol. A total of 210 hypertensive patients were analyzed in the first study, and 25 patients with essential hypertension were evaluated in the second study. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), strain gauge plethysmography, and serum HGF concentration were measured in the first study. We also evaluated these factors before and after treatment with either cilazapril (2.0 mg/day) or atenolol (25 mg/day) for 6 months in the second study. Serum HGF concentration was negatively correlated to reactive hyperemia in overall (r = 0.434, P < .0001) and nontreatment (r = 0.452, P < .0001) hypertensive patients. Arterial stiffness was weakly related to serum HGF concentration (P < .05) after adjusting for age and mean blood pressure (BP). By multiple regression analysis, only serum HGF concentration showed a strong independent correlation with reactive hyperemia, age and mean BP with PWV. Moreover, a relationship between endothelium-dependent vasodilation and serum HGF concentration was observed during treatment with cilazapril or atenolol (r = 0.406, P < .005). These results suggest that in evaluation of serum HGF concentration, the forearm vasodilator response to reactive hyperemia and PWV might be useful for managing hypertension in patients who are receiving antihypertensive therapy.",E,E

We report the baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled in the AFFIRM Study.; More than 7400 patients at more than 200 North American hospitals and clinics qualified for enrollment in the AFFIRM Study. A total of 4060 patients were enrolled in the AFFIRM Study. The average age of patients enrolled was 70 years, with 39% female and 89% white. Hypertension was present in 71%.

The lack of data on angiotensin II receptor blockers is noted although effects are considered to be similar to those reported with ACE inhibitors and therefore to be avoided. Analysis of the literature underscores that some antihypertensive drugs can be used safely at certain stages of pregnancy, while others are suspect and to be avoided at all costs.

Beta-blockers are first-line drugs for the management of systemic hypertension, used alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Drugs in the beta-blocking class have the common property of blocking the binding of catecholamines to beta-adrenergic receptor sites; however, there are significant pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences between the individual agents that are of clinical importance. Among these differences are the completeness of gastrointestinal absorption, the degree of hepatic first-pass metabolism, lipid solubility, protein binding, brain penetration, concentration within the cardiac tissue, rate of hepatic biotransformation, and renal clearance of drug and/or metabolites. Long-acting formulations of existing beta-blockers are currently in use, and ultra-short-acting agents are also available. Age, race, cigarette smoking and concomitant drug therapy can also influence the pharmacokinetics of beta-blocking drugs. The wide interpatient variability in plasma drug concentrations observed with beta-blockers makes this parameter unreliable in routine patient management. Despite the pharmacokinetic differences among beta-blockers, these drugs should always be titrated to achieve the desired individual patient response.",5,E

In the present study, we evaluate the effect of six classes of antihypertensive drugs on PP in an elderly hypertensive cohort.; It was an open, prospective and multicenter study performed by primary care physicians. 857 hypertensive patients (54% women) with a mean age of 68 years were included. Antihypertensive treatment (any antihypertensive drug used in monotherapy) was freely assigned by investigators and then grouped in classes for analysis. Blood pressure was measured by a validated oscillometric device using a standardized protocol.; ACE inhibitors were the mostly used class of antihypertensive drugs (27.8%). We found no differences between drug classes in PP reduction. Likewise, no differences were observed regarding the effect on systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure. The percentage of adverse reactions was low (6.3%). When effects on PP reduction and adverse reactions were pooled together, angiotensin receptor blockers emerged as the antihypertensive drug class with the best profile.; Antihypertensive drugs do not differ substantially in their ability to reduce PP. Although PP is considered as an important prognostic factor for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, the present results do not strengthen its usefulness as a distinctive marker of antihypertensive drug classes.",1,E

In contrast, patients with established heart disease and premature ventricular complexes have a higher likelihood of developing ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. These patients should be treated with a beta blocker or class I antiarrhythmic drug. Treatment of arrhythmias in pregnant women is rarely needed. When treatment is required, amiodarone should be avoided, and beta blockers should be used with caution, because these agents have been associated with fetal growth retardation. The most important rhythm abnormality in athletes is ventricular tachycardia associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. If the presence of the disease is confirmed by echocardiography, beta-blocker therapy is necessary, and these patients should be limited to participation in nonstrenuous sports. Acute arrhythmias in children with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can be treated with adenosine. Radiofrequency ablation of the accessory pathway can provide long-term control.",5,E

Therefore, LVH regression is an important antihypertensive treatment goal. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is implicated in LVH development and myocardial fibrosis in essential arterial hypertension. Early studies in the 80s and 90s have led expectations that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors could induce greater LVH regression than other antihypertensive drugs at similar blood pressure reduction. In the late 90s, the double-blind randomized controlled PRESERVE trial (Prospective Randomize Enalapril Study Evaluating Reversal of Ventricular Enlargement) has been designed to evaluate whether the ACE inhibitor enalapril was more effective than nifedipine GITS in regressing LVH and improving LV diastolic dysfunction. The PRESERVE study demonstrated a mildly higher antihypertensive effect of nifedipine GITS than enalapril, which required more frequently association with hydrochlorothiazide to control blood pressure.

With unoprostone monotherapy, most adverse events were mild or moderate and transient in nature. Less than 7% of unoprostone-treated patients discontinued therapy due to an adverse event. The most common adverse events associated with unoprostone were burning/stinging, burning/stinging directly upon drug instillation, ocular itching, and conjunctival hyperaemia. Unoprostone had no clinically notable effects on vital signs, laboratory profiles, or comprehensive ophthalmic examinations. One of 659 unoprostone 0.15%-treated patients had a change in iris colour after 12 months of monotherapy.

The safety profile of unoprostone 0.15% was consistent with published information on the 0.12% formulation. In conclusion, unoprostone has an excellent safety profile in patients with POAG or OH.",4,E

The administration of medication (eg, beta-blockers, amiodarone, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and digoxin) did not influence the results.; PCWP and changes during therapy can be estimated noninvasively by measuring the PAR during the VM with acceptable accuracy in stable patients with cardiac conditions. Thus, this method may be a useful tool in detecting an elevated PCWP and hemodynamic response to therapy.",E,E

Pharmacogenetics is the search for genetic polymorphisms that affect responses to drug therapy. Investigators have found many associations between genetic polymorphisms and responses to cardiovascular drugs. Some of these relationships have been demonstrated in large patient populations, such as patients with ischemic heart disease receiving statins. Study data consistently show a greater response to statins in ischemic heart disease patients with genotypes associated with worse prognoses. Studies of other polymorphisms, such as those in the genes encoding anglotensin-converting enzyme and beta 1-adrenergic receptors, have less consistently found relationships between these variations and cardiovascular drug responses. For gene-drug response associations for which the data are inconsistent, the interaction of multiple polymorphisms in multiple genes coding for proteins affected by drug therapy or influencing drug metabolism may prove to have a greater influence on drug responses than any one polymorphism. Once the polymorphisms that best determine the response to a particular drug are known and tests to rapidly identify these variations are available, individual patients may be screened for genetic polymorphisms before drug therapy is begun and the information used to choose agents with the greatest potential for efficacy and least potential for toxicity. Pharmacogenetics has many possible applications in the drug therapy of cardiovascular diseases. Much more must be learned, however, before pharmacogenetic factors can be routinely incorporated into therapeutic decisions.",5,E

Reluctance to prescribe these agents may derive from concerns about their association with symptoms of depression, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction.; To determine the association of beta-blockers with depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction by performing a quantitative review of randomized trials that tested beta-blockers in myocardial infarction, heart failure, and hypertension.; Randomized trials of beta-blockers used in the treatment of myocardial infarction, heart failure, or hypertension were identified by searching the MEDLINE database for English-language articles (1966-2001). In addition, we searched the reference lists of previously published trials and reviews of beta-blockers for additional studies.; Criteria for inclusion of trials in the review were: random allocation of study treatments, placebo control, noncrossover design, enrollment of at least 100 patients, and a minimum of 6 months of follow-up. The initial search produced 475 articles, 42 of which met these criteria. Fifteen of these trials reported on depressive symptoms, fatigue, or sexual dysfunction and were selected for inclusion.; For each trial, 1 author abstracted the frequency of adverse events in the beta-blocker and placebo groups and the numbers of patients randomized to the treatment groups. Two other authors verified the counts of events, and all authors adjudicated any discrepancies. Two different types of information on adverse events were abstracted: patient-reported symptoms and withdrawal of therapy due to a specified symptom. We categorized the tested beta-blockers by generation (early vs late) and lipid solubility (high vs low to moderate).; The 15 trials involved more than 35,000 subjects. beta-Blocker therapy was not associated with a significant absolute annual increase in risk of reported depressive symptoms (6 per 1000 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7 to 19). beta-Blockers were associated with a small significant annual increase in risk of reported fatigue (18 per 1000 patients; 95% CI, 5-30), equivalent to 1 additional report of fatigue for every 57 patients treated per year with beta-blockers. beta-Blockers were also associated with a small, significant annual increase in risk of reported sexual dysfunction (5 per 1000 patients; 95% CI, 2-8), equivalent to one additional report for every 199 patients treated per year. None of the risks of adverse effects differed significantly by degree of beta-blocker lipid solubility. The risk associated with reported fatigue was significantly higher for early-generation than for late-generation beta-blockers (P =.04).; The conventional wisdom that beta-blocker therapy is associated with substantial risks of depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction is not supported by data from clinical trials. There is no significant increased risk of depressive symptoms and only small increased risks of fatigue and sexual dysfunction. The risks of these adverse effects should be put in the context of the documented benefits of these medications.",I,8

Most patients with vascular disease report hypertension in their medical history. Irrespective of the specialty that one practices, every physician will likely encounter patients with systemic hypertension. Unfortunately, an overwhelming number have so-called ""primary"" or ""essential"" hypertension for which a cure has yet to be found. Fortunately, excellent therapy is available to control this modern malady. The field of hypertension continues to evolve rapidly, particularly in the field of therapy. During the past two decades, the treatment of hypertension has moved from a cookbook approach to more scientifically based individualized management. This paradigm shift requires the practitioner to acquire sufficient knowledge about individual drugs and how they work in a given patient. Rapid expansion of available drugs has placed a burden on the clinician to keep up with these advances. We hope that the discussions contained herein will ease that burden somewhat and make the treatment options less cumbersome. This article addresses the practical issues related to selection of antihypertensive drugs and provides an overview of advantages and disadvantages of individual drug classes. The reader should also refer to the JNC VI document [1] to further understand the selection of drug therapy based upon compelling indications. The ultimate aim of hypertension management should always be to achieve target or goal blood pressure levels.",5,E

Patients with positive cardiac enzymes and symptoms suggestive of coronary ischemia (n = 275) were divided into 2 groups: group A, with elevated peak creatine kinase-MB fraction and/or new electrocardiographic changes suggestive of AMI regardless of troponin status (diagnosed as AMI by old criteria), and group B, with normal peak creatine kinase-MB fraction but elevated troponin I level (additional patients diagnosed as having AMI by new criteria).; As compared with group A (n = 224), patients in group B (n = 51) were older women, with increased comorbidities such as previous stroke or aortic stenosis, and had fewer in-hospital procedures. In-hospital adverse events (reinfarction, heart failure, shock, and mortality) were similar between the groups, whereas 6-month mortality was higher among group B patients (16.3% vs 5.8%; P =.03).

The authors studied 89 Caribbean Hispanic hypertensive patients who participated in six double-blind, randomized trials of antihypertensive agents. Demographics, laboratory data, sodium excretion, plasma renin activity, and atrial natriuretic peptide were obtained after 3-4 weeks on placebo. Blood pressure responses to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and fixed combinations of ACE inhibitors and HCTZ, were compared to the placebo values after 8-12 weeks of treatment. Patients had a multiple risk factor profile (obesity and diabetes) and a wide spectrum of blood pressure elevation, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hypertensive renal damage. Urine sodium excretion rates indicated inability to comply with salt restriction in 65% of patients. Plasma renin activity was lower than that of Hispanic normotensive controls, and 62% of patients had low-renin essential hypertension by renin profiling to sodium excretion. On analysis of variance, blood pressure reductions by calcium channel blockers, HCTZ, and ACE inhibitor/HCTZ combinations were significantly greater than that with placebo, while those of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers as monotherapy were not. The authors conclude that essential hypertension of Caribbean Hispanics is associated with multiple risk factors and is largely of the low-renin type.

This trial compared two regimens-losartan-based therapy to atenolol-based therapy-in 9193 hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. In the instance of each of these therapeutic groups, hydrochlorothiazide add-on therapy was permitted as per protocol. Although blood pressures were comparably reduced in both the losartan and the atenolol-based treatment groups, stroke rate was notably less in the losartan-treatment group. The 1195 patient diabetic cohort in this trial also experienced a substantial reduction in total and cardiovascular mortality favoring losartan. An additional finding in this trial was that new-onset diabetes developed 25% less frequently in the losartan-treated group. The results of this trial are both interesting and relevant to what is an expanding use of angiotensin-receptor blockers in the hypertensive population.",I,E

Medical records of 2416 patients with newly diagnosed hypertension who were prescribed initial antihypertensive monotherapy by general practitioners in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom were evaluated. Comparisons were made among the angiotensin II receptor antagonist (AIIRA) irbesartan, all other antihypertensive classes (including AIIRAs other than irbesartan), and the AIIRA losartan. Patients initiated on the AIIRA irbesartan scored highest with a persistence rate of 60.8%, followed by patients who received all other AIIRA agents with a persistence rate of 51.3%. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and losartan were associated with comparable persistence rates, between 42.0% and 49.7%. Patients who received diuretics scored lowest with a persistence rate of 34.4%. Persistence has emerged as an essential factor for blood pressure control. Prescribing an antihypertensive agent that provides a favourable efficacy and tolerability profile may provide greater persistence with therapy and hence a higher level of blood pressure control.",E,E

To evaluate whether this association was due only to parallel blood pressure (BP)-induced changes we re-examined the patients after 1 year of antihypertensive treatment to investigate whether changes in LV hypertrophy and UACR were related independently of changes in BP. In 7,142 hypertensive patients included in the LIFE study, we measured UACR, LV hypertrophy by electrocardiography, plasma glucose and BP after 2 weeks of placebo treatment and again after 1 year of antihypertensive treatment with either an atenolol or a losartan based regime. At baseline and still after 1 year of treatment logUACR (R = 0.28, P < 0.001) was still correlated to LV hypertrophy (beta = 0.05) assessed by ECG independently of systolic BP (beta = 0.16), plasma glucose (beta = 0.19) and age (beta = 0.08). Change in logUACR (R = 0.19, P < 0.001) during treatment was correlated to change in LV hypertrophy (beta = 0.10) independently of reduction in systolic BP (beta = 0.13) and change in plasma glucose (beta = 0.06). After 1 year of antihypertensive treatment UACR was still related to LV hypertrophy independently of systolic BP, and the reduction in UACR during that first year of treatment was related to regression of LV hypertrophy independently of reduction in systolic BP. This suggests that the relationship between LV hypertrophy and glomerular albumin leakage is not just due to parallel BP-induced changes. As glomerular albumin leakage may represent generalised vascular damage we hypothesise a vascular relationship between cardiac and glomerular damage.",E,E

Its pathophysiological mechanism is unknown. Recent data suggests that deformability and aggregation of red blood cells may play an important role in the regulation of blood rheology in hypertension. Simultaneously there are reports suggesting that antihypertensive effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) could be counteracted by high doses of aspirin. We postulate that these effects could be related to the changes in blood rheology. Accordingly we designed a study to evaluate the effect of low or high dose of aspirin on deformability and aggregability of red blood cells from patients with essential hypertension. Deformability and aggregability of red blood cells were measured by laser diffractometer (Rheodyn SSD, Myrenne GmbH) and computerized automatic aggregometer (MA1 Myrenne GmbH, Germany), respectively. The effects of aspirin on deformability and aggregation of red blood cells were studied ex vivo in whole blood from three groups of patients with essential hypertension (group I: 10 patients receiving placebo, group II: 23 patients receiving 75 mg/day p.o. aspirin for 3 days, and group III: 23 patients receiving 300 mg/day p.o. aspirin for 3 days). Subjects in all groups received the same combination of antihypertensive agents consisting of: one of ACEI (enalapril or perindopril), one of beta-antagonists (metoprolol or bisoprolol), and diuretic agent (indapamid). In patients receiving high dose of aspirin (300 mg/day) we observed that erythrocyte aggregability was 25% higher than in the placebo group (MEA = 25.8 +/- 6 SD, vs MEA = 20.6 +/- 3 SD, p < 0.05). Aspirin had no effects on deformability of erythrocytes or on arterial blood pressure. High doses of aspirin or possibly also other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) in patients receiving antihypertensive therapy can directly affect rheological properties of the blood due to the activation of red blood cell aggregation. Increased aggregation of red blood cells during antihypertensive therapy may be an important indicator of the worsening of organ perfusion.",1,E

In 1959 patients with a mean LVEF of 33%, treatment with carvedilol over a mean follow-up period of 15 months reduced total mortality from 15.3% with placebo to 11.9% with carvedilol [relative risk reduction (RRR) =23%, absolute risk reduction (ARR) =3.4%]. The incidence of recurrent MI was reduced from 5.8 to 2.3% (RRR 41%, ARR 2.3%). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one death was 28 for the entire study period and 43 for 1 year of treatment. The results of the CAPRICORN trial are compared with three previous beta-blocker post-MI trials: the Gothenburg metoprolol trial (GMT), the Norwegian timolol trial (NTT) and the beta-blocker heart attack trial (BHAT).

Experimental findings suggest that these changes, which include intima-media thickening, may be mediated, at least in part, by angiotensin II (AII).; The Losartan Vascular Regression Study (LAARS) was a double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, controlled, multicenter study designed to compare the effects of the AII antagonist losartan and the beta-blocker atenolol on ultrasonographically determined intimamedia thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery (CCA) in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.; The primary end point of the study was the yearly rate of change (YRC) from baseline of the mean IMT of the CCA (CCA-IMT(mean)) averaged over 2 years of treatment. Secondary end points included IMT of the common femoral artery and sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SiSBP/SiDBP). Safety assessments of losartan and atenolol were made by statistical and clinical review of the incidence of adverse experiences as well as review of vital signs and laboratory values. A total of 414 patients with essential hypertension were screened for study inclusion at 36 study centers in Germany and Brazil. Patients received losartan (50 mg once daily) or atenolol (50 mg once daily) for 24 months. Target blood pressure (SiSBP/SiDBP <140/<90 mm Hg) was achieved by adding hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily, doubling the dose of study drug, or adding an open-label calcium channel blocker sequentially, as needed.; Of the original 414 patients screened, 280 hypertension patients (SiDBP 95-115 mm Hg), aged 35 to 65 years, with an IMT of 0.8 to 1.5 mm of the right or left CCA, were randomized to treatment with either losartan (n = 142) or atenolol (n = 138). Both losartan and atenolol therapy produced comparable reductions in CCA-IMTmean over 24 months compared with baseline; the average YRC was -0.038 +/- 0.004 mm/y (P < or = 0.001) for losartan and -0.037 +/- 0.004 mm/y (P < or = 0.001) for atenolol. There were no significant differences between groups. Losartan showed a greater reduction of femoral artery IMT than did atenolol; the average YRC was -0.024 mm/y (P < or = 0.05) for losartan and -0.017 mm/y for atenolol (P = NS), with no significant difference between groups. Both agents produced similar significant reductions in SiSBP and SiDBP and were generally well tolerated. Approximately 7% of losartan patients had drug-related clinical adverse events, compared with 12% of atenolol patients.; The findings of LAARS, the first large study with an AII antagonist that examined IMT, suggest that AII antagonism reverses the early stages of vascular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension. Further studies are needed to delineate the relative importance of AII antagonism versus blood pressure reduction per se in mediating the beneficial vascular effects of losartan.",E,E

Piezoelectric plethysmography on the third finger, laser Doppler on the third finger at rest and after iontophoretic administration of acetylcholine, and pressure-heart rate monitoring, were carried out both at rest and during handgrip. The tests were performed 45 min after 5 mg nebivolol or 100 mg atenolol administration, then repeated 2 days later with a placebo and, after a further 2 days, with atenolol or nebivolol again.; Both atenolol and nebivolol reduced diastolic blood pressure values and heart rate, as well the increase of blood pressure and heart rate during handgrip. No change was recorded after placebo. Piezoelectric plethysmography showed a significant increase in the ratio between time to peak and total time (PT/TT), calculated on the sphygmic wave, during handgrip (0.295 0.005 versus 0.231 0.015, P<0.005). After nebivolol, a decrease was recorded in rest conditions (0.185 0.008 versus 0.231 0.015, P<0.005) with no statistically significant increase during handgrip, whereas atenolol showed an increase in the PT/TT ratio at rest, with a sustained response during handgrip. Laser Doppler showed an increased response to acetylcholine only after nebivolol.; Nebivolol and atenolol significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, favourably modulating response to handgrip.

All echocardiographic data were read in a central laboratory by staff blinded to the treatments and sequence of echocardiographic tapes.; The estimated treatment difference between the losartan and atenolol regimens (mean change from baseline at week 36) in LVMI was -2.5 g/m(2) [95% confidence interval (CI) -7.36 to 2.37 g/m(2) ] in favor of losartan, indicating that losartan was significantly non-inferior ( 0.001, non-inferiority limit 8 g/m(2) ) and numerically superior to atenolol in reducing LVMI. The losartan-based regimen significantly reduced LVMI after 36 weeks compared with baseline (-6.56 g/m(2) , 95% CI -10.24 to -2.88 g/m(2) , P<0.001), whereas the atenolol-based regimen had no significant effect (-3.71 g/m, 95% CI -7.75 to 0.32 g/m(2) , P= NS). In a subset of 82 patients, significant changes in serum concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide and immunoreactive amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were recorded in losartan-treated ( 0.01) but not atenolol-treated patients. Losartan and atenolol significantly decreased SBP and DBP from baseline after 6, 12, 24 and 36 weeks. The changes from baseline in DBP were greater in the atenolol group at weeks 6 and 36 [difference -2.6 mmHg ( P= 0.016) at week 36]. However, both treatment regimens achieved similar SBP/DBP values at week 36 (141.1 +/- 12.8/86.8 +/- 8.2 mmHg for losartan and 141.4 +/- 17.2/85.0 +/- 10.1 mmHg for atenolol, respectively). Overall, losartan treatment was associated with significantly fewer drug-related clinical adverse events, compared with atenolol (10 and 22%, respectively, P= 0.028).; Both losartan- and atenolol-based regimens effectively decreased blood pressure. Losartan was non-inferior and numerically superior to atenolol in regression of LVH. The reduction in hypertrophy with losartan treatment was accompanied by reductions in circulating concentrations of cardiac natriuretic peptides. Losartan, by specifically blocking angiotensin II, may therefore have effects on the heart beyond those expected from the decrease in blood pressure alone. Losartan was better tolerated than atenolol.",3,E

At baseline, 7998 patients did not have diabetes mellitus and were thus at risk of developing this condition during the study. To demonstrate ability to predict new-onset diabetes, we developed a prediction score using the significant variables from multivariate analyses (serum glucose, body mass index, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and history of prior use of antihypertensive drugs).; There was a steadily increasing risk of diabetes with increasing level-of-risk score; patients in the highest quartile were at considerably greater risk than those in the three lower ones. Treatment with losartan was associated with lower risk of development of diabetes within each of the four quartiles of the risk score. As previously reported, new-onset diabetes mellitus occurred in 242 patients receiving losartan (13.0 per 1000 person-years) and 320 receiving atenolol (17.5 per 1000 person-years); relative risk 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.88; P<0.001).; New-onset diabetes could be strongly predicted by a newly developed risk score using baseline serum glucose concentration (non-fasting), body mass index, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, systolic blood pressure and history of prior use of antihypertensive drugs.

But the apparent high cost of ICD therapy relative to antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone has raised questions about the cost effectiveness of ICD therapy versus drug therapy. To inform this debate we reviewed the literature on ICD cost effectiveness. An electronic and manual search was conducted for articles published since 1980 reporting original data on the cost effectiveness of ICD versus drug therapy for patients at risk of VT/VF. Data on costs and life-years gained were abstracted and studies were grouped into those that used decision-analysis models and those that were trial-based analyses. Cost-effectiveness ratios were inflated to 2001 US dollars. Nine studies were included in the review; five studies were modelling studies and four were part of randomised trials of ICD therapy. Studies varied in time horizon, but all except one indicated that ICD therapy was more costly than drug therapy. Early decision models assumed larger survival benefits than those observed in subsequent trials and therefore had attractive incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in the range of dollars US 27000 to dollars US 60000 per life-year gained. Trial-based studies, with the exception of one small trial, indicated cost per life-year gained in the range dollars US 44000 to dollars US 144000. Stratified analysis shows clearly that patients with a greater risk of mortality due to structural heart disease (e.g. left ventricular ejection fraction < or =35%) benefit more from ICD therapy and therefore have a more attractive cost effectiveness ratio than patients at lower risk. ICD therapy is still evolving over time with implant costs declining and device technology improving. Current evidence is that, in selected patients who are at high risk of VT/VF, ICD therapy can be a cost-effective option. Future research should focus on (i) patient selection to optimise benefits for available resources; and (ii) more comprehensive outcome measures to include health-related quality of life.",4,E

DESIGN. Randomized prospective study.; The obstetric ward of the teaching hospital of Monastir Tunisia.; Sixty consecutive pregnant women admitted beyond the 24th week of pregnancy with severe hypertension.; Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenously for 1 h either labetalol ( n=30) or nicardipine ( n=30). Treatment was titrated to achieve a 20% lowering of blood pressure (BP).; Maternal BP and heart rate were measured at inclusion and repeatedly during the first hour following the drugs administration. Fetal heart rate was recorded throughout the study period. The main outcome endpoints were the success rate and the length of time needed to achieve the therapeutic goal. The rate of maternal and fetal adverse events and dose adjustments were also analyzed.; Labetalol and nicardipine achieved the 20% lowering in BP in the same proportion (63% and 70% success rates, respectively). Overall nicardipine caused a significantly greater decrease in systolic and diastolic BP. No patient had any episode of hypotension. The length of time to achieve the BP goal was also similar (12 vs. 11 min, respectively). Both drugs were well tolerated except for a moderate tachycardia observed with the use of nicardipine.; Nicardipine and labetalol are effective and safe in the initial treatment of severe hypertension of pregnancy.",E,E

In the second phase, atenolol 100 mg was added to amlodipine and isosorbide 5-mononitrate 100 mg to diltiazem (Adizem XL). Ambulatory monitoring (72 h) and exercise testing were repeated after both phases, on treatment and after a 24-h drug-free interval.; Both monotherapy with amlodipine and diltiazem (Adizem XL) were effective on symptoms and ambulatory and exercise ischemia. Combination therapy reduced ischemia further, with amlodipine/atenolol superior to diltiazem (Adizem XL)/isosorbide 5-mononitrate. Amlodipine/atenolol was significantly superior during the drug-free interval with maintenance of ischemia reduction.; Amlodipine, with its intrinsically long half-life alone or together with beta-blocker, is likely to produce superior ischemia reduction in clinical practice when patients frequently forget to take medication or dose irregularly.",E,E

Carvedilol, alpha1-beta-blocker with strong antioxidant activity, may interfere with this chain of events. Therefore, we measured monocyte ecNOS, TGFbeta and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA level and plasma nitrite/nitrate, 3-nitrotyrosine, an estimate of peroxynitrite, and total plasma antioxidant power in kidney-transplanted patients with post-transplant hypertension, before and after treatment with carvedilol, 25 - 50 mg o.d. orally for 4 months (n = 15). The dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nifedipine (n = 10) was used as comparator antihypertensive drug. Blood pressure fell to a similar extent with both drugs. Carvedilol increased plasma antioxidant power and HO-1 mRNA and reduced 3-nitrotyrosine and TGFbeta mRNA levels, while the same was not observed with nifedipine. Monocyte ec NOS mRNA levels and plasma nitrite/nitrate were higher in the patients than in a normotensive healthy control group and were unaffected by either treatment. In conclusion, carvedilol reduces the oxidative stress and corrects the altered cellular signaling mediated by oxidative stress in CsA-induced post-transplant hypertension. Therefore, it may prevent long-term complications, such as endothelial dysfunction, fibrogenesis and post-transplant nephropathy by decreasing NO degradation and production of TGFbeta, a key fibrogenic cytokine, and by activating HO-1 production.",E,E

Correction of these factors leads to a reduction in the progression of plaque formation and associated arterial wall thickness. Atheroma remains, however, a focal disease, developing at characteristic sites within the arterial tree. These sites are typically at areas of vessel branching or marked curvature, and correspond to regions of high tensile stress and low sheer stress, leading to the hypothesis that local haemodynamic factors and vessel wall mechanics potentiate the focal development of atheroma. Current assessment of vascular haemodynamics suffers from an inability to handle complex flow, and does not allow accurate determination of locally varying flow, and shear stress patterns. The application of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) flow simulation techniques to ultrasound and local pressure data, however, allows a comprehensive, non-invasive appraisal of haemodynamic flow parameters to be performed. The Candesartan cilexetil and Atenolol Carotid Haemodynamic Endpoint Trial (CACHET) study compares the effects of two antihypertensive regimens, one b-blocker-based, the other angiotensin receptor blocker based, on carotid intima-media thickness. The collection of ultrasound and pressure data on each subject provides a unique opportunity to apply these data to the CFD model to study the effects of these antihypertensive regimens on local fluid dynamics. This will lead to a greater understanding of the relationship of these factors to atheroma formation and regression.",E,E

Given the major advances in the management of myocardial infarction and its sequelae that have occurred in the last two decades (including the use of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [PTCA], thrombolysis, aspirin, ACEIs, and statins), there was clearly a need to revisit the issue of beta blocker therapy in patients with beta blockers in the setting of post-MI heart failure. For all these reasons, the CAPRICORN trial of carvedilol in post-MI left ventricular dysfunction was an important and eagerly awaited trial, which could show that carvedilol treatment post-MI on top of the so-called modern post-MI therapy reduces mortality.

Earlier clinical trials demonstrated that rizatriptan 5 or 10mg is more effective than placebo at providing pain relief and a pain-free state, relieving associated symptoms of migraine, normalising functional ability and improving patient quality of life, and showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recently, rizatriptan 10mg was shown to be more effective than zolmitriptan 2.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg at producing a pain-free state 2 hours postdose. Furthermore, compared with naratriptan, significantly more patients who received rizatriptan were pain free or had pain relief from 1 hour onwards. The number of patients with normal functional ability at 2 hours was significantly higher after rizatriptan than after naratriptan or zolmitriptan. Rizatriptan was also generally more effective than zolmitriptan or naratriptan at relieving migraine-associated symptoms. Rizatriptan is generally well tolerated, and adverse events are usually mild and transient. The most common adverse events associated with rizatriptan in recent randomised trials were asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and nausea. There was a trend towards a lower incidence of adverse events with rizatriptan compared with zolmitriptan (31.2 vs 38.8%). However, rizatriptan was associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse events than naratriptan (39 vs 29%). The incidence of chest pain was similar after the administration of rizatriptan, zolmitriptan or naratriptan (2-4%). In conclusion, rizatriptan is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine. Oral rizatriptan 5 and 10mg have shown greater efficacy than placebo in providing pain relief, an absence of pain, relief from associated symptoms, normal functional ability and an improvement in patient quality of life. Earlier results showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recent studies have shown that rizatriptan 10mg provides faster pain relief and a higher percentage of patients with an absence of pain and normal functional ability at 2 hours than naratriptan 2.5mg or zolmitriptan 2.5mg. The efficacy of rizatriptan is retained when used in the long term, and the drug is generally well tolerated. Although well designed studies comparing rizatriptan with almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan would further define the position of rizatriptan, current data suggest that rizatriptan should be considered as a first-line treatment option in the management of migraine.",E,E

These conditions coexist in almost 25% of men aged 60 years and older. The use of transurethral prostatectomy, a common surgical therapy for BPH, alleviates symptoms but results in erectile dysfunction (ED) in up to 35% of patients. Pharmacological intervention for BPH, including androgen-suppressing agents, has resulted in an increased incidence of sexual adverse experiences compared with the incidence observed in patients receiving placebo. Patients with hypertension also frequently experience problems with sexual function; in addition, antihypertensive medications used to treat this disease may increase problems with sexual function. ED is an age-related phenomenon, with estimated prevalence rates of 39% among men 40 years old and 67% among those 70 years old. Doxazosin, an alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of patients with BPH and/or hypertension, is not associated with the occurrence of ED compared with other antihypertensive treatments.",3,E

Large-scale, randomized, controlled trials have contributed immensely to our understanding of the management of life-threatening arrhythmias. There are many causes of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, which they occur mostly in the setting of healed myocardial infarction. Available treatments for the management of ventricular arrhythmias include antiarrhythmic drugs, implantable cardioverter defibrillators and catheter ablation. Each therapy provides unique advantages for selected patients with life-threatening arrhythmias. Because the goal of arrhythmia management is not only to provide the single best therapy but to provide the greatest assurance of symptomatic arrhythmia control, the use of combined therapy has become a standard treatment strategy for patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias. This review will discuss the different modes of treatment available for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and their potential risks and benefits. The rationale for using hybrid or combination therapy will be presented. Finally, some of the better-known primary and secondary prevention trials for treatment of ventricular tachycardias will be reviewed.",I,8

Similarly, propranolol was randomly compared to placebo (NaCl, n = 14).

Diuretics are the first-line symptomatic treatment for heart failure. beta-blockers should be initiated on an outpatient basis once the patient is stable, euvolaemic (by means of a diuretic) and established on an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Large trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of the beta-blockers carvedilol, metoprolol and bisoprolol in patients with heart failure, most of whom were also receiving ACE inhibitors. However, the mean age of patients in these trials was generally 60 to 65 years, with very few patients aged >75 years being recruited. It is, thus, not immediately clear how to apply these trial results to older patients with heart failure. Subgroup analyses from these large beta-blocker heart failure trials suggest that older patients gain similar benefit from beta-blocker treatment to younger patients. The trials, however, give no guidance as to whether older patients should receive the same target dosage or titration regimen as younger patients. It is suggested that a less aggressive titration regimen may be more appropriate for older patients while still attempting to achieve the trial target dosages. Titration can be safely achieved on an outpatient basis. In particular, a period of observation in the clinic after initiation of treatment does not appear to be necessary. The survival benefit resulting from the use of a beta-blocker in patients with heart failure is modest (months rather than years). It is, thus important not to neglect the effects of treatment on quality of life. A proportion of patients experience adverse effects with a beta-blocker. For such patients a balance needs to be made between the adverse effects on quality of life and the likely extension of life from the use of a beta-blocker. For patients who can tolerate a beta-blocker, the available evidence suggests that it can improve quality of life. The evidence currently available does not support the use of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) in addition to an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker. For patients unable to tolerate an ACE inhibitor or beta-blocker, the use of an ARB may confer some advantage.",I,8

Hemodynamic studies were performed after >/=12 h of wash-out from all cardiovascular medications, except the beta-blockers that were administered 3 h before the second study.; Compared with before beta-blocker therapy, metoprolol treatment decreased the magnitude of mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) decline during dobutamine infusion and increased the cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume index (SVI) response to enoximone administration, without any effect on other hemodynamic parameters. Carvedilol treatment abolished the increase in heart rate, SVI, and CI and caused a rise, rather than a decline, in PAP, PWP, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary vascular resistance during dobutamine infusion. The hemodynamic response to enoximone, however, was maintained or enhanced in the presence of carvedilol.; In contrast with its effects on enoximone, carvedilol and, to a lesser extent, metoprolol treatment may significantly inhibit the favorable hemodynamic response to dobutamine.

More complete definition of the impact of myocardiocyte loss on prognosis and of the mechanisms involved may lead to improved understanding of cardiac remodeling and possibly improved patients' care. Mitochondrial damage and bcl-2 to bax balance play a central role in ischemia-dependent apoptosis while angiotensin II and beta(1)-adrenergic-stimulation may be major causes of receptor-mediated apoptosis. Benefits due to treatment with ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers appear to be in part due to reduced myocardial apoptosis. Moreover, infarct-related artery patency late after AMI may be a major determinant of myocardial apoptosis and clinical benefits deriving from an open artery late post AMI (the ""open artery hypothesis"") may be, at least in part, due to reduced myocardiocyte loss.",E,E

One thousand ninety-two patients received study medication (celecoxib, n = 549; rofecoxib, n = 543). Significantly more patients in the rofecoxib group compared with the celecoxib group developed increased systolic BP (change >20 mm Hg plus absolute value > or =140 mm Hg) at any time point (14.9% vs 6.9%, p <0.01). Rofecoxib caused the greatest increase in systolic BP in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta blockers, whereas those on calcium channel antagonists or diuretic monotherapy receiving either celecoxib or rofecoxib showed no significant increases in BP. Clinically significant new-onset or worsening edema associated with weight gain developed in a greater percentage of patients in the rofecoxib group (7.7%) compared with the celecoxib group (4.7%) (p <0.05).

We hypothesized that antihypertensive drugs have differing influences upon the pulse wave even when their effects on blood pressure are the same. We studied 30 untreated hypertensive patients, aged 28-55 years, who were rotated through six 6-week periods of daily treatment with amlodipine 5 mg, doxazosin 4 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, bisoprolol 5 mg, bendrofluazide 2.5 mg or placebo. The best drug was repeated at the end of the rotation. Blood pressure readings and radial pulse tonometry (by Sphygmocor) were performed at each visit, and blood was taken for measurement of levels of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). The Sphygmocor derivation of the central aortic pulse wave was used to measure time for transmission of the reflected wave (T(R)) and the augmentation index (AI), which is the proportional increase in systolic pressure due to the reflected wave. There was a dissociation between the effects of the drugs on blood pressure and pulse wave analysis. Bisoprolol caused the greatest falls in blood pressure and T(R), but was the only drug to increase AI. This paradoxical response to bisoprolol was associated with a 3-fold increase in plasma BNP levels. There was a smaller elevation of BNP in women compared with men, as described previously, and this elevation also was associated with significantly higher values of AI. Other drugs reduced AI, and this was associated with a significant decrease in BNP by amlodipine. In conclusion, antihypertensive drugs differ in their short-term effects on augmentation of the systolic pulse wave and secretion of BNP from the heart, regarded as a sensitive measure of strain on cardiomyocytes. These differences may help to explain cause-specific differences in outcome in recent trials.",E,E

Some antihypertensive agents influence experimental models of atherosclerosis through mechanisms independent of blood pressure lowering.; The European Lacidipine Study on Atherosclerosis (ELSA) was a randomized, double-blind trial in 2334 patients with hypertension that compared the effects of a 4-year treatment based on either lacidipine or atenolol on an index of carotid atherosclerosis, the mean of the maximum intima-media thicknesses (IMT) in far walls of common carotids and bifurcations (CBM(max)). This index has been shown by epidemiological studies to be predictive of cardiovascular events. A significant (P<0.0001) effect of lacidipine was found compared with atenolol, with a treatment difference in 4-year CBM(max) progression of -0.0227 mm (intention-to-treat population) and -0.0281 mm (completers). The yearly IMT progression rate was 0.0145 mm/y in atenolol-treated and 0.0087 mm/y in lacidipine-treated patients (completers, 40% reduction; P=0.0073). Patients with plaque progression were significantly less common, and patients with plaque regression were significantly more common in the lacidipine group. Clinic blood pressure reductions were identical with both treatments, but 24-hour ambulatory systolic/diastolic blood pressure changes were greater with atenolol (-10/-9 mm Hg) than with lacidipine (-7/-5 mm Hg). No significant difference between treatments was found in any cardiovascular events, although the relative risk for stroke, major cardiovascular events, and mortality showed a trend favoring lacidipine.; The greater efficacy of lacidipine on carotid IMT progression and number of plaques per patient, despite a smaller ambulatory blood pressure reduction, indicates an antiatherosclerotic action of lacidipine independent of its antihypertensive action.",I,E

The effects of valsartan were tested by ANCOVA, controlling for baseline values and concomitant ACE inhibitors and/or beta-blockers. BNP and NE concentrations were similar at baseline in the 2 groups and were decreased by valsartan starting at 4 months and up to 24 months. BNP increased over time in the placebo group. At the end point, least-squares mean (+/-SEM) BNP increased from baseline by 23+/-5 pg/mL in the placebo group (n=1979) but decreased by 21+/-5 pg/mL (n=1940) in the valsartan group (P<0.0001).

Norepinephrine reuptake inhibition with sibutramine conceivably could exacerbate arterial hypertension and promote cardiovascular disease.; In 11 healthy subjects (7 men, age 27+/-2 years, body mass index 23.1+/-0.7 kg/m2), we compared the effect of sibutramine or matching placebo (ingested 26, 14, and 2 hours before testing) on cardiovascular responses to autonomic reflex tests and to a graded head-up tilt test. In addition, we tested sibutramine in combination with metoprolol. Testing was conducted in a double-blind and crossover fashion. Supine systolic blood pressure was 113+/-3 mm Hg with placebo, 121+/-3 mm Hg with sibutramine (P<0.001 versus placebo), and 111+/-2 mm Hg with the combination of sibutramine and metoprolol. Similarly, sibutramine increased upright blood pressure. Sibutramine substantially increased upright heart rate. This effect was abolished with metoprolol. The blood pressure response to cold pressor and handgrip testing was attenuated with sibutramine compared with placebo. Furthermore, sibutramine decreased low-frequency oscillations of blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine concentrations in the supine position.; The cardiovascular effect of the antiobesity drug sibutramine results from a complex interaction of peripheral and central nervous system effects. The inhibitory clonidine-like action of sibutramine on the central nervous system attenuates the peripheral stimulatory effect. Our findings strongly suggest that current concepts regarding the action of sibutramine on the sympathetic nervous system should be reconsidered.",3,E

At baseline, participants underwent an extensive examination that included the measurement of BP, use of medications, and other risk factors. Participants were followed up with annual visits that assessed BP and medication use from baseline in 1989-1990 through the examination in 1998-1999. The primary outcome measures were control of BP to levels lower than than 140/90 mm Hg and the prevalence of use of various classes of antihypertensive medications.; The awareness, treatment, and control of high BP improved during the 1990s. The proportions aware and treated were higher among blacks than whites, though control prevalences were similar. For both groups combined, the control of high BP to lower than 140/90 mm Hg increased from 37% at baseline to 49% in 1999. The 51% whose BP was not controlled generally had isolated mild to moderate elevations in systolic BP. Among treated persons, the improvement in control was achieved in part by a mean increase of 0.2 antihypertensive medications per person over the course of 9 years. Improved control was also achieved by increasing the proportion of the entire Cardiovascular Health Study population that was treated for hypertension, from 34.5% in 1990 to 51.1% in 1999. Time trends in antihypertensive drug use were pronounced. Among those without coronary disease, the use of low-dose diuretics and beta-blockers decreased, while the use of newer agents, such as calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and alpha-blockers increased.; While control of high BP improved in the 1990s, about half the participants with hypertension had uncontrolled BP, primarily mild to moderate elevations in systolic BP. Low-dose diuretics and beta-blockers--the preferred agents since 1993 according to the recommendations of the Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure--remained underused. More widespread use of these agents will be an important intervention to prevent the devastating complications of hypertension, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.",I,8

In most randomised studies, combinations of verapamil SR 120 to 240 mg/day and trandolapril 0.5 to 8 mg/day were significantly more effective in lowering sitting DBP and SBP than the corresponding monotherapies administered at the same dosage. Trandolapril/verapamil SR 2/180 mg/day provided significantly more effective 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) control than of the corresponding monotherapies. Moreover, trandolapril/verapamil SR reduced BP in patients inadequately controlled with either of the corresponding monotherapies. The antihypertensive efficacy of trandolapril/verapamil SR 2/180 mg/day was generally similar to that of other combinations of antihypertensive agents (metoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol/chlorthalidone, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide) in patients with hypertension, including those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Trandolapril/verapamil SR reduced BP in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes or primary renal disease, Black patients and elderly patients. Trandolapril/verapamil SR was more effective than the individual components administered as monotherapy in reducing proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes or primary renal disease. Trandolapril/verapamil SR had a neutral or beneficial effect on metabolic parameters (glucose, insulin, lipids) in patients with hypertension, including those with type 2 diabetes. Trandolapril/verapamil SR preserved left ventricular function in patients with heart failure. Fewer cardiac events occurred after therapy with trandolapril/verapamil SR than after trandolapril alone in post-myocardial infarction patients with congestive heart failure. The incidence of adverse events in recipients of trandolapril/verapamil SR was similar to that of the individual components, and that of other combination therapies. In placebo-controlled trials conducted in the US, headache, upper respiratory tract infections, cough, constipation, atrioventricular block (first degree) and dizziness were the most commonly reported adverse events in recipients of combinations of verapamil SR (120 to 240 mg/day) and trandolapril (0.5 to 8 mg/day). In conclusion, the fixed-dose combination of trandolapril/verapamil SR is an effective treatment for patients with hypertension, including those with type 2 diabetes. Trandolapril/verapamil SR tended to be more effective than monotherapy with either verapamil SR or trandolapril, and generally showed antihypertensive efficacy similar to that of other combination antihypertensive therapies. Current data support the use of trandolapril/verapamil SR as an alternative treatment when monotherapy with either agent is not effective. Data from large clinical trials currently being conducted will assist in fully defining the role of trandolapril/verapamil SR as a cardio- and renoprotective agent.",E,E

The effects of antihypertensive therapy on QT dispersion, which reflects cardiac repolarization heterogeneity, in relation to changes in LV mass has not been well studied. Repeat echocardiography and QT measurements (standard 12-lead electrocardiograms) were performed in hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy, who were randomized double-blind to receive the angiotensin II type 1-receptor blocker irbesartan (n = 44) or the beta(1)-receptor blocker atenolol (n = 48) for 48 weeks, and in 37 matched hypertensive control subjects without LV hypertrophy. LV mass index was related to QT dispersion (r = 0.34, p <0.001). The reduction in LV mass was greater using irbesartan than using atenolol (-27 +/- 28 vs -15 +/- 21 g/m(2) at 48 weeks, p = 0.021), with similar reductions in blood pressure. Irbesartan decreased QT dispersion (from 56 +/- 24 ms to 45 +/- 20 ms at 48 weeks; p <0.001) and QTc dispersion (from 57 +/- 24 to 44 +/- 19 ms at 48 weeks; p <0.001). In contrast, atenolol had minor effects. The decreases in QT and QTc dispersions were greater using irbesartan than using atenolol (p = 0.001 and p = 0.011, respectively); the same results were found when changes in LV mass, blood pressure, and heart rate were also included in multivariate analyses. Thus, heterogeneity of ventricular repolarization is related to the degree of LV hypertrophy. Irbesartan, but not atenolol, reduces QT and QTc dispersions independent of changes in LV mass, blood pressure, or heart rate, and thus seems to induce structural and electrical remodeling in a direction that could decrease the risk of fatal events in hypertensive patients.",E,E

At rest, both drug-treated groups had lower QTVI (p <0.001) than after placebo, but during tilt patients treated with carvedilol had a lower QTVI than those treated with metoprolol (p <0.05). Although both beta-blocker treatments helped to normalize the QTVI measured in normal subjects at rest, they each differentially altered the index after tilt.

The incidence increases markedly with advancing age. Thus, with the growing proportion of elderly individuals, atrial fibrillation will come to represent a significant medical and socioeconomic problem. The consequences of atrial fibrillation have the greatest impact. The risk of thromboembolism is well known; other outcomes of atrial fibrillation are less well recognised, such as its relationship with dementia, depression and death. Such consequences are responsible for diminished quality of life and considerable economic cost. Atrial fibrillation is characterised by rapid and disorganised atrial activity, with a frequency between 300 and 600 beats/minute. The ventricles react irregularly, and may contract rapidly or slowly depending on the health of the conduction system. Clinical symptoms are varied, including palpitations, syncope, dizziness or embolic events. Atrial fibrillation may be paroxysmal, persistent or chronic, and a number of attacks are asymptomatic. Suspicion or confirmation of atrial fibrillation necessitates investigation and, as far as possible, appropriate treatment of underlying causes such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypoxia, hyperthyroidism and congestive heart failure. In the evaluation of atrial fibrillation, cardiac exploration is invaluable, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography, with the aim of detecting cardiac abnormalities and directing management. In elderly patients (arbitrarily defined as aged >75 years), the management of atrial fibrillation varies; it requires an individual approach, which largely depends on comorbid conditions, underlying cardiac disease, and patient and physician preferences. This management is essentially based on pharmacological treatment, but there are also nonpharmacological options. Two alternatives are possible: restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm, or control of ventricular rate, leaving the atria in arrhythmia. Pharmacological options include antiarrhythmic drugs, such as class III agents, beta-blockers and class IC agents. These drugs have some adverse effects, and careful monitoring is necessary. The nonpharmacological approach to atrial fibrillation includes external or internal direct-current cardioversion and new methods, such as catheter ablation of specific foci, an evolving science that has been shown to be successful in a very select group of atrial fibrillation patients. Another serious challenge in the management of chronic atrial fibrillation in older individuals is the prevention of stroke, its primary outcome, by choosing an appropriate antithrombotic treatment (aspirin or warfarin). Several risk-stratification schemes have been validated and may be helpful to determine the best antithrombotic choice in individual patients.",E,E

Safety was similar between groups, including corneal and conjunctival staining, conjunctival hyperemia graded by anterior segment photography and at the slit lamp, and unsolicited and solicited side effects. Vision recovery after instillation was similar between groups.; TXE demonstrates a lower intraocular pressure eight hours after dosing than does TXG, but safety appears similar between products.",4,E

Long-term beta-blocker therapy prevents such deterioration through inhibition of this neurohormonal pathway. The impressive survival data collected from several large studies have made beta-blockers a component of standard therapy for New York Heart Association class II to III heart failure. Although there are differences in the pharmacological properties of the beta-blockers shown to improve morbidity and mortality in heart failure, there is little evidence to suggest that such properties constitute any major advantages in clinical outcome. Carvedilol and extended-release metoprolol succinate are 2 beta-blockers currently approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with heart failure. Both agents have shown similar risk reductions in overall and cause-specific mortality; however, no outcome data from a comparative trial are available to support the use of one agent over the other. Regardless of the agent chosen, appropriate dosing and titration of beta-blockers are essential for successful therapy.",I,8

The long-term benefit of this therapy in survivors of myocardial infarction who are subsequently revascularized, however, has not been defined or studied rigorously. We reviewed the published data to clarify the role of beta blockade in patients who had surgical revascularization after myocardial infarction. We found that patients who received beta blockers after myocardial infarction had a reduced mortality rate and fewer cardiac events in most clinical situations, a benefit which likely extends to patients who have had subsequent surgical revascularization.",5,E

This study compared the HVPG reduction and safety of long-term carvedilol and propranolol. Fifty-one cirrhotic patients were randomly assigned to receive carvedilol (n = 26) and propranolol (n = 25). Hemodynamic measurements and renal function were assessed at baseline and after 11.1 +/- 4.1 weeks. Carvedilol caused a greater decrease in HVPG than popranolol (-19 +/- 2% vs. -12 +/- 2%; P <.001). The proportion of patients achieving an HVPG reduction >/=20% or </=12 mm Hg was greater after carvedilol (54% vs. 23%; P <.05). Carvedilol, but not propranolol caused a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) (-11 +/- 1% vs. -5 +/- 3%; P =.05) and a significant increase in plasma volume (PV) and body weight (11 +/- 5% and 2 +/- 1%, respectively; P <.05). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unchanged with either drug, but the dose of diuretics was increased more frequently after carvedilol (27% vs. 8%; P =.07). Adverse events requiring discontinuation of treatment occurred in 2 patients receiving carvedilol and in 3 receiving propranolol. In conclusion, carvedilol has a greater portal hypotensive effect than propranolol in patients with cirrhosis. However, its clinical applicability may be limited by its systemic hypotensive effects. Further trials are needed to confirm the therapeutic potential of carvedilol.",E,E

As alpha-blockers have an additional beneficial effect on serum lipids, it seems reasonable to use them instead of beta-blockers or diuretics in insufficiently treated hypertensive patients with hyperlipidemia.; All patients with insufficient blood pressure control with either a calcium channel blocker or an ACE inhibitor and evidence of hyperlipidemia (total serum cholesterol > 5.69 mmol/L) were included into an open, randomized and prospective study to evaluate the effects of terazosin and atenolol on lipid profile in hypertensive patients. The patients received either terazosin (n = 26; dose 1 to 10 mg) or atenolol (n = 28; dose 25 to 100 mg).

Recent data allude to a disease-modifying effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) in retarding the new development of heart failure in high-risk populations. Angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) have not been demonstrated to be superior to ACE-Is and their value in achieving incremental benefits in addition to ACE-Is is limited to scenarios in which beta-adrenergic receptor blocker therapy is not applicable. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in addition to ACE inhibition offers incremental benefits that are achieved early and are beneficial in most stages of severity except in the presence of overt decompensation. Unlike ACE-Is, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers cannot be construed as a class but are heterogeneous in their therapeutic response.",E,E

In all, 29 nonobese (body mass index [BMI], <30 kg/m ), normolipidemic patients with established HT (159 +/- 3/99 +/- 1 mm Hg) but normal GT were recruited. Eleven normotensive (125 +/- 3/85 +/- 1 mm Hg) subjects were matched to the patients for both anthropometric and metabolic variables. Following baseline studies (serum lipid profile, oral GT, insulin release, and insulin sensitivity assessed by the insulin clamp technique), patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to two combination regimens (verapamil 180 mg/day + trandolapril 2 mg/day or atenolol 50 mg/day + nifedipine 20 mg/day) and restudied 3 months later. Blood pressure was normalized in both groups (with decrements of 25 +/- 5/17 +/- 2 and 29 +/- 3/15 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively). Lipid profile, GT, insulin release, and insulin sensitivity of both glucose uptake and lipolysis were unchanged following both treatments. The authors conclude that in nonobese, normolipidemic, glucose-tolerant hypertensive patients, BP normalization with combination therapy is feasible at no cost in terms of undesired effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity.",E,E

In subjects with primary hypertension and with reduced diurnal BP fall with sleep there is consistent evidence of increased target-organ damage. However, the few studies that have addressed the reproducibility of diurnal rhythm in normal or hypertensive subjects have concluded that the BP fall with sleep is poorly reproducible. It is not known whether the same is true for patients with renal disease.; In 30 subjects with autosomal polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), mild chronic renal failure and normal office BP levels on standardised anti-hypertensive treatment, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was done three times over a twelve month period to assess the reproducibility of blood pressure fall with sleep.; When comparing ABPM 2 with the ABPM 1 recording (3 months difference between measurements) only 43.3% of the patients maintained the initial dipping category (defined by quartiles of the ABPM 1 diurnal BP distribution). The same proportion of subjects had a similar dipping category, when ABPM 3 was compared to ABPM 1 (9 months difference between measurements), but a large (24%) subset of patients had dramatic shifts in their amplitude in nocturnal BP fall, significantly greater than those recorded after a shorter inter-measurement interval. Equally important, our study reveals the fact that, with time, there is no tendency to decrease circadian variation: a similar proportion (a quarter to one third) of patients increased or decreased their amplitude in nocturnal BP fall, at 3 and 9 months. When several ABPM measurements are repeated for the same patients, the repeatability is even worse, since only 36.6% of our study population maintained the initial dipping category across all three ABPM determinations (ABPM 1 and ABPM 2 and ABPM 3).; There is a widespread abnormality in diurnal BP rhythm in ADPKD patients with renal impairment, but the extent of this abnormality varies considerably over time. It is too simplistic to assume that, having arbitrarily categorised subjects into ""dippers"" or ""non-dippers"", these labels will always be valid. Thus, it would be unwise to extrapolate the impact of a single baseline circadian BP profile on organ target end points.",E,E

Blood pressure control varied by geographic regions, practice settings, and demographic and clinical characteristics of participants.; These data demonstrate that blood pressure may be controlled in two thirds of a multiethnic hypertensive population in diverse practice settings. Systolic blood pressure is more difficult to control than diastolic blood pressure, and at least two antihypertensive medications are required for most patients to achieve blood pressure control.

Therefore, it is important for practitioners to become familiar with the wide variation in sexual side effects produced by antihypertensive agents and to discuss the potential occurrence of these side effects with their patients. In many cases, a change in the patient's drug regimen may help patients overcome specific sexual side effects experienced with certain treatments. Practitioners should consider selecting an antihypertensive therapy that is highly effective in lowering blood pressure but preserves patients quality of life. The effect of medications on sexual function remains controversial. Some blinded trials report little difference between placebo and specific medications, whereas other studies indicate that antihypertensive medications increase sexual dysfunction, which has an impact on quality of life. Recent evidence suggests that losartan, an angiotensin II antagonist, is not typically associated with development of sexual dysfunction and may actually positively impact several indices of sexual function (erectile function, sexual satisfaction, and frequency of sexual activity) as well as perceived quality of life. Thus, angiotensin II antagonists may offer a therapeutic option to prevent or correct erectile dysfunction in patients with hypertension. The favorable effects of these agents on sexual function may be related, in part, to their ability to block angiotensin II, which has recently become recognized as an important mediator of detumescence and possibly erectile dysfunction.",5,E

We investigated the effects of indapamide, nicardipine, propranolol, and chlorthalidone on arterial blood pressure and LV mass and function.; Sixty-four patients (34 men and 30 women) completed the 6-month study. No significant differences in antihypertensive effects of the four medications were found. The average decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 12.8% and 10.4%, respectively. All four antihypertensive medications caused pronounced reduction in LV mass, between 7.9% in the propranolol group and 10.1% in the nicardipine group, with no significant difference between the groups. In patients receiving diuretics, predominant decrease was observed in LV mass and LV mass index. In patients treated with propranolol, the thickness of both the LV wall and interventricular septum was reduced, whereas the reduction in LV mass, LV wall and interventricular septum thickness was found in patients treated with nicardipine. There was no significant correlation between the changes in LV mass and other variables (blood pressure, and systolic and diastolic function). Systolic function did not improve with the reversion of LV hypertrophy in any group of patients, but improvement was observed in some indices of diastolic function. The early and late LV filling velocity and their ratio did not improve significantly, either. Clinically relevant side effects were not observed.; All four antihypertensive monotherapies achieved a comparable control of hypertension and reduction in LV hypertrophy.",2,E

However, these patients often will have significant co-morbidities that may influence the choice of medication, a decision that also may be affected by cost or Health Plan directives. Wherever possible, monotherapy should be attempted first, although in select circumstances combination therapy may be more appropriate. The 5 main categories of drugs used in the initial treatment of hypertensive vascular diseases are (1). diuretics, (2). beta-adrenergic blockers, (3). calcium channel blockers, (4). angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and (5). angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). There are also other less commonly used drugs. Each of the antihypertensive agents is roughly equally effective, producing a good antihypertensive response in 40% to 60% of cases. Some antihypertensives, especially ACE and ARBs, also may have beneficial effects on the vascular and metabolic systems separate from their blood pressure lowering effects, which suggests they may be beneficial even if blood pressure is well maintained with other agents. This report covers the basic information required for the vascular surgeon to become familiar with the various medications and their indications, dosage, and side effects. It also provides some guidelines in selecting relevant antihypertensive treatment regimens for the elderly patient with arterial vascular disease.",5,E

Donepezil (5 to 10 mg kg(-1) i.p.) induced a dose-dependent antinociception that reached its maximum effect 15 minutes after injection. Donepezil antinociception was prevented by the antimuscarinic drug scopolamine. At analgesic doses, donepezil did not alter gross animal behavior. These results indicate that donepezil is endowed by muscarinic antinociceptive properties, suggesting this compound as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of painful pathologies. Therefore, we investigated donepezil's effect in migraine. Donepezil (5 mg per os, evening assumption) was effective as a prophylatic agent in patients suffering from migraine with or without aura by reducing the number of hours with pain, the number of attacks, and the severity of the pain attack. The efficacy of donepezil was compared with that of the beta-blocker propranolol (40 mg bid per os), showing higher activity. Response rates of a large-sized open study devoid of entry criteria regarding migraine subtypes suggest the drug as an excellent prophylactic compound for migraine in general practice. Clinical results also indicate that the activation of the cholinergic system can represent a novel prophylactic approach to migraine.",5,E

We investigated the effect of nonspecific beta-adrenergic stimulation (isoproterenol) and blockade (propranolol) on clotting diathesis in hypertension. Fifteen hypertensive and 21 normotensive subjects underwent isoproterenol infusion in two sequential, fixed-order doses of 20 and then 40 ng. kg(-1). min(-1) for 15 min/dose. Thirteen subjects were double-blind studied after receiving placebo or propranolol (100 mg/day) for 5 days each. In hypertensive subjects, isoproterenol elicited a dose-dependent increase in plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen [F(2,34) = 5.02; P = 0.032] and a decrease in D-dimer [F(2,34) = 4.57; P = 0.040], whereas soluble tissue factor remained unchanged. Propranolol completely abolished the increase in vWF elicited by isoproterenol [F(1,12) = 10.25; P = 0.008] but had no significant effect on tissue factor and D-dimer. In hypertension, vWF is readily released from endothelial cells by beta-adrenergic stimulation, which might contribute to increased cardiovascular risk. However, beta-adrenergic stimulation alone may not be sufficient to trigger fibrin formation in vivo.",3,E

Additionally, the specific characteristics presented by HFA/AS introduce unique complications to patient care and place unusual demands on a clinician's skill and experience. To provide safe and effective treatment, the clinician must understand the core features of the disorder and the manifestations of the condition in his or her patient. Furthermore, a thorough understanding of the family, school, and community resources and limitations is necessary. Once an assessment has been made, focusing on target symptoms provides a crucial framework for care. Knowing manifestations of symptoms and characterizing their distribution and behavior in that patient is most important. For patients with HFA/AS it is particularly essential to coordinate behavioral and pharmacologic objectives. The target symptoms should be tracked carefully and placed into a priority system that is based on the risks and disability they create for the patient. The skill of pharmacotherapy also means setting out realistic expectations, keeping track of the larger systems of care at school and home, and collaboration with parents and care providers. There is an expanding range and pace of biologic and intervention research into HFA/AS. The genetic work has produced exciting leads that are likely to be helpful to future generations [82-84], but the task of clinicians is to tend to today's patients. As we discover more about the complex neural circuitry subserving repetitive behaviors, reward systems, and social cognition, there are good reasons to believe our treatments will become more sophisticated and specific. Psychopharmacology is also moving to design medications that target more specific populations of receptor and brain functions. This is likely to produce medicines that have fewer side effects, are more effective, and are more symptom-specific. Pharmacotherapy is not the ultimate treatment for HFA/AS but it has a definite place. Medication can be a critical element in a comprehensive treatment plan. There is a wider range of medications with more specific biologic effects than ever before. For patients with HFA/AS these newer agents are safer and less disruptive. When paired with clinicians who are becoming more skilled at recognizing and managing symptoms, patients have a greater opportunity to reach their potential and lead pleasurable lives.",5,E

However, both coronary artery bypass graft and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty failed to make the symptomatic or subclinical ischaemic manifestations of chronic coronary insufficiency disappear. The interest of using betablockers as a first-line therapy was widely demonstrated. However, their combination with another efficient molecule is often necessary. The aim of this trial has been to appreciate the efficiency of the association of a betablocker with either trimetazidine or with isosorbide monoitrate. Hundred and eighty five patients retaining a positive effort test despite 100 mg of atenolol, received in addition, either 60 mg of trimetazidine (93 cases) of 60 mg of isosorbide mononitrate (92 cases) for a two-month period and are then re-evaluated at the end of this period. The ischaemic threshold is delayed in a significant way in both groups (p < 0.0001; trimetazidine +7%, isosorbide mononitrate +10.7%). Twenty-three percent of the exercise tests under trimetzidine and 19% under isosorbide mononitrate become negative after two months of the therapeutic combination. The clinical improvement is even clearer with the disappearance of the angina crisis during the week before the second exercise test in 63% of the cases under trimetazidine and 54% of the cases under isosorbide mononitrate, among the patients who had kept it under atenolol at the inclusion. In conclusion, the combination of a second efficient molecule, trimetazidine or isosorbide mononitrate, brings a functional and objective improvement to patients with insufficient chronic coronary disease not totally controlled using a betablocker, even with high dosage. One should notice two important advantages in favour of the trimetazidine: one is practical due to a better tolerance (lack of cephalalgia), the other is conceptual (use of the complementary metabolic approach of cellular oxygenation rather than the haemodynamic approach of nitrate compounds which are already in concurrency with all other anti-ischaemic molecules).",1,E

It has a high prevalence, is frequently co-morbid with medical illnesses, impacts negatively on quality of life, increases the number of visits to different medical services, and carries a high risk of suicide, especially in men. Imaging studies have increased our understanding of the biological mechanisms of depression in the elderly. Depression is sometimes difficult to diagnose in the elderly. It should be differentiated from apathetic states ( negative syndrome ), and its treatment requires knowledge of specific physiological changes that occur in this age group. Geriatric depression is more somatic and less ideational than depression in other age groups. Acute treatments with various antidepressant medications, augmentation strategies, electroconvulsive treatments, and psychotherapy must be coupled with maintenance strategies to prevent recurrences, which are common.",5,E

In a double blind, crossover study with a balanced design, they received placebo, atenolol 50 mg, perindopril 8 mg, felodipine 10 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg. The study periods were 2 months. Ambulatory BP monitoring was performed at the end of each period, and was divided into awake periods (9:00 AM to 10:00 PM), sleep periods (12:00 AM to 6:00 AM), and morning periods (6:00 AM to 9:00 AM). Medication was taken at 9:00 AM.; The four drug classes lowered 24-h mean SBP (P <.05), but the fall with atenolol was less than with the other drugs. The fall in awake BP with perindopril was less than with felodipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Atenolol caused no significant fall in sleep or morning SBP, and the falls with the other three drugs were significant and were greater than the fall with atenolol. The fall in sleep BP with perindopril was greater than with the other drug classes. The awake-sleep difference in SBP increased with perindopril, stayed the same with felodipine and hydrochlorothiazide, and was reduced by atenolol.; In this study, the response to the different drug classes differed. The response to drugs that work relatively nonspecifically (diuretics, calcium blockers) was relatively consistent over 24 h. The response to beta blockers and to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reflected the activity of control systems. This finding supports the concept of multiple drug therapy that may need to be tailored to the time of day.",5,E

Beta blockers improve mortality after acute myocardial infarction, but through an unknown mechanism. Depressed HRV, a measure of autonomic tone, predicts mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Whether beta blockers influence recovery of HRV after acute myocardial infarction, and thereby improve outcome, is unknown. We compared 24-hour HRV parameters at 1 week after acute myocardial infarction and after 6 weeks of treatment with propanolol (n = 88) or placebo (n = 96). The relation between 25-month outcome (death/acute myocardial infarction/congestive heart failure), propranolol treatment, and HRV was further analyzed. After 6 weeks, high-frequency (HF) power (log-normalized), an index of vagal tone, increased more in propranolol-treated patients (4.28 +/- 0.1 to 5.17 +/- 0.09 ms(2)) than in placebo-treated patients (4.26 +/- 0.09 to 4.77 +/- 0.1 ms(2), p <0.05). Sympathovagal balance measured by the low-frequency (LF) to HF ratio increased in placebo-treated patients (3.55 +/- 0.24 to 3.86 +/- 0.24) but decreased in those treated with propranolol (3.76 +/- 0.29 to 3.17 +/- 0.23, p <0.01). Other frequency-domain parameters increased over time but were not affected by propranolol. Propranolol blunted the morning increase in the LF/HF ratio. Recovery of HF, the strongest HRV predictor of outcome, and propranolol therapy independently predicted outcome. In summary, after acute myocardial infarction, propranolol therapy improves recovery of parasympathetic tone, which correlates with improved outcome, and decreases morning sympathetic predominance. These findings may elucidate the mechanisms by which beta blockers decrease mortality and reduce the early morning risk of sudden death after acute myocardial infarction.",E,E

No data are available describing outcomes of patients admitted with exacerbated chronic heart failure who are receiving beta blockade at the time of admission. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate clinical outcomes in patients from the Outcomes of the Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure (OPTIME-CHF) study who were prescribed beta blockers on admission compared with patients who were not prescribed beta blockers at admission. In all, 212 patients were treated with beta blockers at admission and 737 patients were not. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, except that patients prescribed beta blockers on admission had slightly higher ejection fractions, fewer New York Heart Association class IV symptoms, and lower heart rates. There was no difference in clinical events between patients who were treated with beta blockers at the time of admission and those who were not. Exploratory analyses suggested that patients whose beta-blocker therapy was discontinued had a higher risk of adverse outcomes, particularly in the subset of patients randomized to milrinone. The data from this nonrandom comparison suggest that continuation of pre-existing beta-blocker therapy is not associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events in patients admitted with worsening heart failure. These results also suggest that caution should be taken when withdrawing beta blockade in this population.",3,E

In a sub-study, we compared sympathetic, hemorrheological and vascular effects in small but particularly well-matched groups of participants who had been on reasonably equipotent but unchanged doses of carvedilol (n = 10) or atenolol (n = 10) for at least 4 weeks. Blood pressures (p < 0.05), plasma adrenaline (p = 0.034), plasma vasopressin (p = 0.022) and whole blood viscosity at shear rate 0.5 cp (p = 0.050), 1.1 cp (p = 0.023), 5.8 cp (p = 0.049) and 201 cp (p = 0.060) taken in the laboratory at baseline before 2 h of using the hyperinsulinemic, isoglycemic glucose clamp were lower on carvedilol. Plasma noradrenaline was lower on carvedilol at baseline and throughout the clamp (p < 0.0005). Forearm vascular resistance as measured by plethysmography during the clamp tended to be lower on carvedilol (p = 0.074). No significant difference was found between the groups in glucose disposal rate measured by clamp, maximal forearm blood flow and minimal forearm vascular resistance after 10 min of ischemia, or in ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate taken a few days later. Thus, potential benefits of carvedilol vs atenolol were seen in these post-infarction patients in a laboratory setting. These findings suggest that the inhibitory effects on the sympathetic nervous system and related blood viscosity are stronger with carvedilol than with atenolol.",E,E

It is the aim of both parts of this review to make qualified conclusions and recommendations applying a methodologic critique to assess the current literature. In the first part of this series, we review the demographics of hypertension in patients with COPD. This is followed by an extensive review of the use of specific classes of antihypertensive drug therapies in patients with pulmonary disease. The antihypertensive agents reviewed include diuretics, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and alpha-beta-blockers and other non-beta-blocker classes.

In particular, with regard to the use of radioiodine therapy, strategies vary between many European and North American pediatric endocrinology centers. After the diagnosis is made, antithyroid drug treatment with methimazole (thiamazole), carbimazole, or propylthiouracil should be performed with caution, in particular, because of severe adverse effects, such as agranulocytosis or hepatitis, that are found in up to 1% of patients. Antithyroid drug treatment should not be continued long-term, particularly since definitive remission cannot be expected in more than 30-40% of patients. In contrast, the risk of severe adverse effects is still present, and the risk of thyroid carcinoma increases with time and appears to be considerably higher than after radioiodine treatment. To a great extent, the success of surgery depends on the skills of a trained surgeon. The question of whether to perform total or subtotal thyroidectomy is yet to be resolved. Surgery should be considered in patients with a large thyroid gland (>80g), severe ophthalmopathy, and a lack of remission on antithyroid drug treatment. Success rates have increased to up to 97%, while severe adverse effects (laryngeal nerve palsy, hypoparathyroidism) occur in approximately 4% of patients. Mortality is below 0.1%. Radioiodine treatment in children >5 years of age does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of thyroid carcinoma; however, long-term data are lacking. Compared with the surgical approach, success rates are lower, particularly if low doses of radioiodine are used. In general, adverse effects are less prevalent than in patients who have undergone surgery.",5,E

The first step in the office setting is to assess the individual CHD risk. This combines the evaluation of current CHD or a ""secondary risk equivalent"" with the counting of risk factors and in many cases, the absolute risk calculation. The next steps are to consider each of the major modifiable risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking status) to set goals for each and then work to achieve those goals through lifestyle changes and medication therapy. We reviewed each of these risk factors in detail and then turned to a discussion of emerging risk factors that may help ""fine-tune"" the risk assessment in some borderline cases. We also discussed additional non-invasive testing that is available to the clinician to help refine the assessment of current burden of disease. Finally, we discuss some of the barriers that exist on both a global and local level to effective treatment of CHD risk factors.",5,E

Recent studies have suggested that treatment with spironolactone reduces pressure and flow in the portal and variceal systems. This trial was designed to assess if nadolol plus spironolactone is more effective than nadolol alone to prevent the first variceal bleeding. One hundred patients with medium and large varices who had never bled and were without ascites were included in a prospective, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The patients were randomized into 2 groups: 51 received nadolol plus placebo (N + P) and 49 received nadolol plus spironolactone 100 mg/d (N + S). Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and activity of the renin-aldosterone system (plasma renin activity/plasma aldosterone levels) were measured in 24 patients. There were no significant differences in the appearance of variceal bleeding and ascites between groups at a mean follow-up of 22 +/- 16 months. However, analyzing both complications together, the incidence was significantly higher in the N + P group than in the N + S group (39% vs. 20%; P <.04). Clinical ascites was also higher in patients in the N + P group than in the N + S group (21% vs. 6%; P <.04). Significant increases in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels were only observed in patients in the N + S group (P <.01). The cumulative probabilities of remaining free of bleeding and ascites were similar in both groups after 70 months of follow-up. In conclusion, these results suggest that nadolol plus spironolactone does not increase the efficacy of nadolol alone in the prophylaxis of the first variceal bleeding. However, when bleeding and ascites were considered together, the combined therapy effectively reduced the incidence of both portal-hypertensive complications.",3,E

In cirrhosis, an insufficient hepatic production of nitric oxide (NO) may impair the expected hepatic vasodilatory response to increased blood flow, further exaggerating the postprandial increase in portal pressure. This study was aimed at investigating whether low doses of an oral NO donor might counteract the postprandial peak in portal pressure. Twenty-three portal hypertensive cirrhotics, 8 of them under propranolol therapy, were randomized to receive orally 5-isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN; 10 mg; n = 11) or placebo (n = 12) and a standard liquid meal 15 minutes later. Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and hepatic blood flow (HBF) were measured at baseline and 15, 30, and 45 minutes after a meal. ISMN significantly attenuated the postprandial increase in portal pressure as compared with placebo (peak HVPG increase: 2.4 +/- 1.4 mm Hg vs. 5.2 +/- 2.1 mm Hg, P =.002). Percentual increases in HBF were similar in both groups. MAP decreased slightly in ISMN group (-7.5% +/-.5%; P <.01 vs. baseline). These effects were also observed in patients on chronic propranolol therapy. In conclusion, hepatic NO supplementation by low doses of ISMN effectively reduces the postprandial increase of portal pressure in cirrhosis, with only a mild effect on arterial pressure. The same was observed in patients receiving propranolol. Our results suggest that therapeutic strategies based on selective hepatic NO delivery may improve the treatment of portal hypertension.",4,E

The patients had been randomized to double-blind treatment with either the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker irbesartan or the beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocker atenolol. Genotyping was performed using a microarray based DNA polymerase assisted 'minisequencing' single nucleotide primer extension assay with fluorescence detection. The observed genotypes were related to the blood pressure reduction using stepwise multiple regression analysis. The allele frequencies of the selected SNPs were determined in the Swedish population. The established microarray-based genotyping system was validated and allowed unequivocal multiplex genotyping of the panel of 74 SNPs in every patient. Almost 7200 SNP genotypes were generated in the study. Profiles of four or five SNP-genotypes that may be useful as predictors of blood pressure reduction after antihypertensive treatment were identified.

There have been a number of significant randomized controlled trials which may influence management in each of these three categories.; For primary prevention, the recent information from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation, Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction to Hypertension, Study on Cognition and Prognosis in the Elderly and Australian National Blood Pressure Study support the view that blood pressure lowering protects against stroke regardless of baseline blood pressure level. There is some evidence that blockade of the angiotensin system may give additional protection. For secondary prevention, evidence from the Perindopril Protection against Recurrent Stroke Study shows that blood pressure lowering with perindopril based therapy reduces fatal or non-fatal stroke events, again in hypertensive or normotensive individuals. There is uncertainty about blood pressure lowering in acute stroke, although presentation of the recent Acute Candesartan Cilexetil Evaluation in Stroke Survivors trial in which there was significant protection against vascular events using candesartan suggests that further studies should be undertaken.; Blood pressure lowering for primary prevention of stroke should be undertaken using a variety of therapeutic agents. For secondary stroke prevention perindopril based therapy should be used based on current evidence. Uncertainty still exists as to whether blood pressure lowering in the acute stroke setting is safe or improves outcomes.",5,E

Travoprost-treated patients had a smaller predicted change in visual field defect score (VFDS) than latanoprost-treated patients and timolol-treated patients, and significantly fewer were expected to demonstrate visual field progression. Medical care costs would be higher for latanoprost-treated and timolol-treated patients.; Recent studies have provided algorithms linking IOP control to changes in visual fields.

We used meta-regression to investigate the association between the odds ratios of outcome (experimental vs. reference treatment) and the corresponding blood pressure differences between study groups. Thus, we correlated odds ratios with between-group differences in systolic pressure. We then compared odds ratios of benefit observed in recent trials with those predicted by meta-regression on the basis of the differences in systolic pressure between randomized groups. Among nine actively-controlled trials in hypertension, significant differences in systolic pressure (follow-up minus baseline) between randomized groups (experimental minus reference) were observed in the ALLHAT, CAPPP, MIDAS, and NORDIL trials. Furthermore, the differences in achieved systolic and/or diastolic pressure between study groups were also significant in the hypertension trials and studies in high-risk patients, which involved untreated control patients. The differences between the observed odds ratios and those predicted by meta-regression did not reach statistical significance except for NORDIL and the single-drug therapy subgroup of the PROGRESS trial. In NORDIL, the risk of stroke was lower on diltiazem than on the older drug classes despite a 3.1 mm Hg higher systolic pressure on the calcium channel blocker. In PROGRESS, perindopril alone reduced blood pressure by 5/3 mm Hg, but did not affect the incidence of all cardiovascular events or the recurrence of stroke. In conclusion, the finding that in the reviewed trials blood pressure reduction largely accounted for outcome emphasizes the desirability of tight blood pressure control. The hypothesis that blood pressure-lowering medications might influence cardiovascular prognosis over and beyond their antihypertensive effect remains to a large extent unproved.",5,E

A fourth double-blind randomised trial (with a duration of 12 months) compared brinzolamide twice a day and three times daily with timolol monotherapy. Local tolerance was compared in two dedicated studies. Rates of switching to a new medication regimen were evaluated through a US health maintenance organisation database. In case of treatment failure, the patients were treated with latanoprost. A model was developed to value direct medical costs over 3 months. The economic perspective was that of the third-party payer and the patient, and included direct medical costs (reimbursed part plus co-payment).; Patients with ocular hypertension and/or primary open-angle glaucoma who had not responded to or could not tolerate beta-blocker therapy.; The daily direct medical costs of therapy with the two drugs.; As monotherapy, brinzolamide twice daily and three times daily was found to be as efficacious as dorzolamide three times a day. Brinzolamide twice daily plus timolol was also as efficacious as a combination of dorzolamide and timolol twice a day. Stinging of the eye upon instillation with brinzolamide was experienced by fewer patients than with dorzolamide (p < 0.0001). The likelihood of patients treated with dorzolamide changing therapy was 1.28 times greater than that for those treated with brinzolamide. The size of the brinzolamide drop is 18.7% smaller than that of dorzolamide allowing seven more therapy days per bottle with brinzolamide twice daily than with dorzolamide monotherapy, and five more days when brinzolamide is used three times a day. The direct medical costs for patients treated with brinzolamide were lower in all four European countries when drop size was taken into account than for those treated with dorzolamide. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our findings.; Because brinzolamide can be prescribed twice daily in monotherapy and because fewer patients treated with brinzolamide switch therapy due to local intolerance, our model suggests that brinzolamide is a cost-saving alternative to dorzolamide.",3,E

In the primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, beta-blockers are still the mainstay of pharmacotherapy. Measurement of the hepatic portal venous pressure gradient is considered to be a reliable parameter for successful reduction of portal pressure using medical therapy. However, intolerance of propranolol requiring discontinuation of therapy has been observed in approximately 30 % of patients. Patients' compliance with medication may represent another drawback of medical therapy. The role of endoscopic band ligation in secondary prophylaxis is now indisputable, especially in comparison with sclerotherapy. In the primary prevention of variceal bleeding, band ligation is beginning to have a competitive edge over pharmacological therapy. Acute variceal bleeding is no longer a frequent morbid emergency. Most cases of bleeding can now be managed successfully with band ligation and N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate obliteration. N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate has come into increasingly widespread use in the treatment of bleeding gastric fundal varices in which surgery or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting were previously regarded as the preferred therapies.",5,E

ACEIs, through their effect on RAS, may improve cardiovascular functions, pulmonary dynamics, and body fluid homeostasis. Thus, ACEIs have become an integral part of management of patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic renal disease. ACEIs, due to differences in their chemical structure, exert different pharmacological actions and can have protective or occasional damaging effects on different organs. The anesthesiologists are commonly involved in the management of patients treated with ACEIs. Thus, the role of ACEIs and their possible interaction with anesthetic agents must be an integral part of clinical decision-making during anesthesia Hemodynamic variation during anesthesia is mainly related to specific effects of anesthetic agents on sympathetic nervous system. Those with preoperative fasting, volume depletion and extended sympathetic blockade can have reduced vascular capacitance resulting in decreased venous return, reduced cardiac output and severe arterial hypotension. Angiotensin II (ANG2) a potent vasoconstrictor may counterbalance such hypotensive effect. During ACE inhibition ANG2 cannot counterbalance this hypotension. Thus, induction of anesthesia may cause severe hypotension in hypovolemic patients specifically in those receiving diuretics as a complement to ACEIs. Recent advances in RAS and the pharmacology of ACEIs have identified some predisposing factors and risks associated with anesthesia in patients treated with ACEIs. Practitioners should be vigilant, and readily have vasopressors, necessary fluids and other resuscitative measures for treatment of unexpected hemodynamic instability during anesthesia and surgery.",5,E

Hence, with conventional dosage, plasma enalaprilat may be markedly elevated. It is unclear whether this excess of drug exposure affords an improved control of blood pressure. The aim of the present study was to evaluate short-term blood pressure response to two different plasma levels of enalaprilat.; As part of an open, randomized, controlled trial of the effect of high and low dosage of enalapril on the progression of renal failure, short-term blood pressure response was evaluated. Data were analysed in all patients completing 3 months of follow-up. The patients were allocated to two trough plasma concentrations of enalaprilat, either above 50 ng ml(-1) (high) (n = 17) or below 10 ng ml(-1) (low) (n = 18), and the daily dose of enalapril titrated accordingly.; Median (range) glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at baseline was 18 (7.9) in the high enalaprilat concentration group and 17 (7.3) ml min(-1) 1.73 m(2) in the low concentration group (NS). Nine patients in each group were on treatment with enalapril at baseline with a median daily dose of 5 mg in both the high (5-10) and low (2.5-20) concentration group. At 3 months' follow-up, the dose was 10 (2.5-30) and 1.9 (1.25-5) mg (P < 0.0001), respectively. After 3 months median trough concentrations of enalaprilat were 82.5 (22-244) ng ml(-1) and 9.1 (2.5-74.8) ng ml(-1) (P < 0.002). At baseline the median systolic blood pressures in the two groups were 140 (110-200) and 133 (110-165), in the high and low enalaprilat concentration groups, respectively, and after 3 months they were 135 (105-170) and 130 (105-170) mmHg (NS). Median diastolic blood pressure was 80 mmHg in each group both at baseline (65-100) and at follow-up (60-95) (NS).

In Australia 7.4% of people over 25 years of age have diabetes (mostly type 2) and comparable or higher prevalences have been reported in the United States and a number of Asian countries. The enormous economic and social cost of this disease makes a compelling case for prevention. Epidemiological studies have shown clearly that type 2 diabetes results from an interaction between a genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors including obesity, sedentary behaviour and both calorie excess and various dietary constituents. The natural history of type 2 diabetes includes a preceding period of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)/impaired fasting glucose (IFG) which provides an opportunity for targeted intervention within large communities. Lifestyle intervention studies have consistently shown that quite modest changes can reduce the progression from IGT to diabetes by 50-60%. It may, however, not be possible to translate these successful findings to larger cohorts or maintain the lifestyle changes longer term. This has lead to consideration of pharmacotherapy. While small studies with sulphonylureas are inconclusive, benefits have been found for metformin, acarbose and troglitazone. Big intervention studies with ramipril, rosiglitazone, valsartan and nateglinide are underway. Pharmacological intervention raises a whole range of ethical, economic and practical issues not the least of which is the problem of long term therapy of the 'otherwise well'.",5,E

Long-term control medications are recommended for all children who have asthma symptoms that occur more frequently than twice weekly or nocturnal symptoms more than twice monthly. Environmental control measures to decrease allergen exposure are important, as is attention to sinusitis and GER. The main impediment to improved asthma care is poor patient compliance. Many patients do not understand the role and importance of prophylactic medications in asthma treatment. Further, inconvenient dosing regimens, difficulties with metered-dose inhalers, and fear of potential side effects have all contributed to poor patient compliance. Increased efforts at patient education are needed to improve adherence to asthma plans.

In this study we investigated the amplitude and determinants of bisoprolol-induced ANP increase and the relationships between this increase and the antihypertensive effect of bisoprolol. Nineteen patients with mild to moderate hypertension were included in the study. In the first phase of the study (cross-over, placebo controlled, randomized phase), the effects of 10 mg bisoprolol on plasma ANP at rest and during exercise were compared to placebo. The antihypertensive action of bisoprolol was then evaluated after a 2-week period of treatment (10 mg/day) using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Bisoprolol significantly increased plasma ANP level at rest (from 30.6 +/- 20.5 to 42.8 +/- 35.6; P < 0.05) and also during exercise (from 54.7 +/- 44.3 to 119.1 +/- 159.9; pg/mL +/- SD; P < 0.05).

After the 15 days of treatment, the bisoprolol-induced daytime diastolic blood pressure reduction was significantly correlated to the initial bisoprolol-induced plasma ANP increase (r = 0.49, P = 0.035).

Cyclophosphamide in fibrosing alveolitis, intravenous prostaglandins and other vasodilators for the vascular disease, endothelin-1 inhibition in pulmonary hypertension and immunosuppressive therapy for early inflammatory disease, all appear to have benefit. Several agents used in vitro and in animal models of fibrosis also show promise including anti-transforming growth factor-beta, the statins and anti-integrins. More experience in well-designed clinical trials is needed to define the role of these agents in treating scleroderma.",5,E

Common disturbances include erectile dysfunction in men, menstrual abnormalities in women, and decreased libido and fertility in both sexes. These abnormalities are primarily organic in nature and are related to uremia as well as the other comorbid conditions that frequently occur in the chronic kidney failure patient. Fatigue and psychosocial factors related to the presence of a chronic disease are also contributory factors. Disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis can be detected before the need for dialysis but continue to worsen once dialytic therapy is initiated. Impaired gonadal function is prominent in uremic men, whereas the disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis are more subtle. By contrast, central disturbances are more prominent in uremic women. Therapy is initially directed toward optimizing the delivery of dialysis, correcting anemia with recombinant erythropoietin, and controlling the degree of secondary hyperparathyroidism with vitamin D. For many practicing nephrologists, sildenafil has become the first line therapy in the treatment of impotence. In the hypogonadal man whose only complaint is decreased libido, testosterone may be of benefit. Regular gynecologic follow-up is required in uremic women to guard against potential complications of unopposed estrogen effect. Uremic women should be advised against pregnancy while on dialysis. Successful transplantation is the most effective means of restoring normal sexual function in both men and women with chronic kidney failure.",5,E

TIPS is used for the control of acute variceal bleeding and for the prevention of vericeal rebleeding when pharmacologic therapy and endoscopic therapy have failed. Patients with refractory ascites with adequate hepatic reserve and renal function who fail to respond to large volume paracentesis may be reasonable candidates for TIPS. Promising indications for TIPS are Budd-Chiari syndrome uncontrolled by medical therapy, severe portal hypertensive gastropathy, refractory hepatic hydrothorax, and hepatorenal syndrome. TIPS cannot be recommended for preoperative portal decompression solely to facilitate liver transplantation. Special care should be taken to insure proper placement of the stent to avoid increasing the technical difficulty of the transplantation procedure. The major limiting factors for TIPS success are shunt dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy. Because shunt stenosis is the most important cause of recurrent complications of portal hypertension, a surveillance program to monitor shunt patency is mandatory. The MELD score may be useful in predicting post-TIPS survival, and also in counseling patients and their families.",5,E

As an example, both sedation and mental depression have been described in patients receiving centrally acting antihypertensive drugs and beta-adrenergic blockers, related to their antiadrenergic actions. In contrast, because of these antiadrenergic actions, agents like clonidine have been used to treat opiate, alcohol, and nicotine withdrawal, while beta blockers have been used to treat symptoms of performance anxiety, migraine, and psychocardiac disorders. Some antiarrhythmic drugs have been associated with delirium, and digitalis toxicity has been shown to cause hallucinations, mania, euphoria, and depression. The calcium-channel blocker verapamil has been used as an adjunctive treatment in patients with bipolar disorders.

We hypothesized that both treatment regimens would have comparable hour 2 IOP-lowering effects at month 3. The treatments were considered comparable if the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the treatment difference was within +/- 1.5 mmHg. Tolerability data were also collected at 1, 3, and 6 months.; The primary efficacy analysis was based on the modified intent-to-treat population.

This study was conducted to compare the efficiency of two interim analysis procedures, which could be used to allow early termination of a clinical trial.; We made a post hoc application of two interim analysis methods (Lan & DeMets with O'Brien-Flemming modification, and the triangular test according to Whitehead) by using individual patient data from four published placebo-controlled survival trials. We determined the date the trial would have been stopped had each method been used, and we estimated consequent results in terms of events and patient numbers included in the trial, the duration of the trial, and on treatment effect.; The triangular test provided the lowest number of events required to reach a conclusion of the trials while providing an accurate estimate of experimental treatment effects. The triangular test thus indicated the smallest number of patients that would have been enrolled, and the shortest trial duration. The difference between the methods was most important with a detrimental effect of experimental treatment: the number of required events was reduced by 75% and the trial duration was shortened by 48% with the triangular test compared to the Lan & DeMets method.; Stopping a trial early must depend on the clinical context. It is most important to stop a placebo-controlled trial as soon as possible when the experimental treatment can be shown deleterious. In such a situation the triangular test is more appropriate than the Lan & DeMets method. When a treatment effect is no different from, or better than, placebo the triangular test is also superior but the importance of premature termination of the trial in such cases has to be balanced against the inevitable reduction of information that the trial can provide.",5,E

Primary study authors and device manufacturers were contacted, and bibliographies of relevant papers were hand searched.; Randomized, controlled clinical trials evaluating ICDs versus usual care were selected.; Two reviewers extracted data independently.; Eight trials were included in the final analysis (4909 patients, 1154 deaths). Compared with usual care (most commonly amiodarone therapy), ICDs significantly reduced sudden cardiac death (relative risk [RR], 0.43 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.53]) and all-cause mortality (RR, 0.74 [CI, 0.67 to 0.82]). The included trials were divided a priori into two categories: secondary prevention (involving patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest or unstable ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation [ n = 1963]) and primary prevention (involving patients at increased risk for sudden cardiac death but without documented cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia [ n = 2946]).

Estimating this risk in an individual patient is difficult and complex. Although noninvasive imaging tests are often used for this purpose, a review of the literature reveals that the positive predictive value of noninvasive imaging tests is uniformly low and that they do not provide information beyond that obtained by assessing simple clinical risk variables. Moreover, no evidence exists that noninvasive imaging tests lead to a therapeutic strategy that reduces the risk for perioperative myocardial infarction or cardiac death. Since the publication of guidelines for preoperative risk stratification by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association in 1996 and the American College of Physicians in 1997, three clinical trials have shown that beta-blocker therapy reduces the risk for perioperative cardiac events. This paper focuses on the relationship between risk stratification and subsequent therapy to minimize or eliminate risk. In short, the paradigm is shifting from predicting which patient is at high risk for having a perioperative cardiac event to minimizing the likelihood of such an event with specific perioperative pharmacologic therapy.",5,E

Patients surviving a variceal bleed are at high risk of rebleeding (over 60% at 1 year). Portacaval shunts and transjugular intrahepatic portasystemic shunts (TIPS) are effective for prevention of rebleeding but carry a high risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Endoscopic techniques include band ligation (EBL) and injection sclerotherapy (EIS). Drug approaches are based on non-selective beta blocker with or without isosorbide-5-mononitrate (ISMN).; David Patch and colleagues (Gastroenterology 2002; 123: 1013-19) randomised 102 patients surviving a variceal bleeding to EBL or drug therapy with propranolol with the addition of ISMN if target reductions in portal pressure (evaluated by the hepatic venous pressure-gradient [HVPG]) were not achieved at 3 months. Overall, results of drug therapy were similar to those of EBL (44% vs 54% rebleeding at 1 year). There were no differences in survival or non-bleeding complications. Christophe Bureau and colleagues (Hepatology 2002; 36: 1361-66) treated 34 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension with propranolol and measured HVPG after a median of 4 days. Target HVPG reductions were achieved in 13 ""responders"". ISMN was added in the 21 ""non-responders"" and HVPG measured again: seven more patients achieved target HPVG reduction. Re-bleeding rates were lower in responders than in non-responders (10% vs 64%). Both studies suggest that drug therapy can be improved by adding ISMN to b blockers in those patients with an insufficient decrease in HVPG. WHERE NEXT? Long-term drug therapy is emerging as effective treatment for the prevention of variceal rebleeding. The role of HVPG monitoring as a guide to identifying patients requiring further treatment needs to be further evaluated.

This review describes some of the conceptual background for QOL measurements and looks at the effects on QOL of different antihypertensive treatments available today. The latest addition to the range of antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin II-receptor blockers, may be a significant step forward in treatment, as their ease of dosing and excellent tolerability minimise negative effects on patients while their possible benefits on factors such as sexual function may even improve QOL in hypertensive patients.",5,E

It is associated with clustering of coronary risk factors and 60-80% of cases have hypertension. The first therapeutic action is appropriate adjustment of life style. Anti-hypertensive therapies such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists have been effective in reducing cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes, though calcium antagonists may be less effective than older therapies and ACE-inhibitors in reducing the risk of heart attacks and heart failure (but possibly more effective in stroke reduction). Beta-blockers (BBs) have a poor image as a potential therapy due to apparent adverse effects on surrogate end-points such as insulin-resistance. However large, controlled trials have shown BBs to be highly effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events and death in post myocardial infarction patients with diabetes. The UKPDS study in type 2 diabetics with hypertension showed first-line beta-blockade to be at least as effective as ACE-inhibition in preventing all primary macrovascular and microvascular end-points. The active ingredient appears to be beta-1 blockade, acting not only to lower blood pressure but also to prevent sudden death and cardiovascular damage stemming from chronic beta-1 stimulation associated with raised noradrenaline activity. By contrast, in the LIFE study atenolol was less effective than the angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan in reducing cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in mainly elderly hypertensives with diabetes. Thus the best beta-blocker results in reducing hard cardiovascular end-points occur in hypertension studies (including the UKPDS study) involving younger/middle aged (say less than 60-65 years) patients, with relatively high sympathetic activity, relatively compliant/elastic arteries (narrow pulse-pressure) and normally functioning beta-1 receptors. In elderly hypertensive patients beta-blockers may be given as second-line therapy on the back of a low-dose diuretic (but possibly as first line agent in elderly hypertensives with prior myocardial infarction). Thus inappropriate attention to surrogate end-points can lead to faulty prescribing habits. Beta-blockers, currently severely underprescribed, should be considered as a first line therapeutic option for all diabetics with ischaemic heart disease or younger/middle aged diabetics with hypertension (but co-prescribed with low dose diuretic therapy in the elderly). The active ingredient for cardiovascular protection appears to be beta-1 blockade; optimal efficacy in lowering blood pressure and safety e.g. reducing risk of bronchoconstriction, is achieved by choosing an agent with high beta-1 selectivity.",5,E

A black box warning is applied when serious adverse drug reactions are uncovered for medications. We sought to examine the evidence of a causal association suggested by the black box warning to aid clinicians in their risk-benefit analyses regarding further use of droperidol.; A literature search was undertaken to determine the evidence regarding the association between droperidol and QT prolongation or torsades de pointes.

In adults it is estimated that up to 4% of the population has CDH, however, this number appears to be lower in children. The actual prevalence of CDH in children, however, has not been determined. The simplest definition of CDH is > 15 headache days per month. In the international headache society (IHS) criteria, only chronic tension-type headaches and chronic cluster headaches are recognised as CDH. Criteria for CDH have been suggested for adults that mirror the IHS criteria. In children, the majority of CDH appear to be migraine related. The next revision of the IHS criteria has been proposed to include chronic migraine as one of the CDH. Evaluation of CDH needs to include a complete history and physical examination to identify any possibility of the headache representing secondary headaches. Treatment and management involves a multi-tiered approach, which includes abortive therapy when the headache becomes more severe. With the precaution of avoiding overuse of analgesic medication, prophylactic therapy is used to help reduce the characteristics of the headache as well as the frequency and mild behavioural therapy.",5,E

Traditional cardiovascular drugs seem to have little influence on the overall cytokine network, and immunomodulatory therapy has emerged as a possible new treatment modality in CHF. Several animal studies have suggested that modulation of inflammatory cytokines may improve cardiac performance. The authors have recently demonstrated that intravenous immunoglobulin enhances the left ventricular ejection fraction in CHF patients, and that this is significantly correlated with anti-inflammatory effects of such therapy. While intravenous immunoglobulin is not necessarily the drug of choice, this study suggests a potential role for immunomodulatory therapy in CHF in addition to optimal cardiovascular treatment regimens.

If the portal vein pressure is decreased by pharmacological therapy the varices will not bleed and progressively decrease in size. The portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients develops as a consequence of two mechanisms: the increase of portal inflow and the increase of intrahepatic resistance. The aim of our study was to find out if propranolol can prevent the bleeding from esophageal varices and if it acts by reducing the portal inflow due to splanchnic vasodilatation. The study was initiated in 53 patients with portal hypertension, of whom 14 were withdrawn because of adverse effects of propranolol. Abdominal ultrasonography and Doppler of portal vein system were performed in all subjects. The ultrasonographic parameters were measured before and after a 3-year treatment with propranolol. The patients also underwent endoscopy for evaluation of esophageal varices; the endoscopy was repeated at the end-point of treatment.

The magnitude of the problem has led to numerous efforts to identify preventive and therapeutic strategies. In normoalbuminuric patients, optimal glycemic control (HbA(1c) lower than 7.5%) plays a fundamental role in the primary prevention of ESRD [weighted mean relative risk reduction (RRR) approximately 37% for metabolic control versus trivial renoprotection for intensive anti-hypertensive therapy or ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I)]. In the microalbuminuric stage, strict glycemic control probably reduces the incidence of overt nephropathy (weighted mean RRR approximately 50%), while blood pressure levels below 130/80 mmHg are recommended according to the average blood pressure levels obtained in various studies. In normotensive patients, ACE-I markedly reduce the development of overt nephropathy almost regardless of blood pressure levels; in hypertensive patients, ACE-I are less clearly active (weighted mean RRR approximately 23% versus other drugs), whereas angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) appear strikingly renoprotective. Once overt proteinuria appears, it is uncertain whether glycemic control affects the progression of nephropathy. In type 1 diabetes, various anti-hypertensive treatments, mainly ACE-I, are effective in slowing down the progression of nephropathy; in type 2 diabetes, two recent studies demonstrate that ARB are superior to conventional therapy or calcium channel blockers (CCB). In clinical practice, pharmacological tools are not always used to the best benefit of the patients. Therefore, clinicians and patients need to be educated regarding the renoprotection of drugs inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the overwhelming importance of achieving target blood pressure.",5,E

Vascular remodelling of small and large vessels provoked by arterial hypertension is the initial step in the development of atherosclerosis and lipohyalinosis. Vascular remodelling can be improved or even normalized by antihypertensive treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-I-receptor antagonists showing the most convincing effects. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-I-receptor antagonists have the lowest rate of side-effects, however, economic restraints hinder their general application. Statins are needed to treat dyslipidaemia. They also lower blood pressure and have a synergistic effect with the above two antihypertensive components in lowering blood pressure. In hypertensive patients, risk of stroke and other cardiovascular complications is determined by the blood pressure level and the presence or absence of target organ damage and the interaction with other risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes.

They are categorized according to their chemical structure into ethanolamines, alkylamines, ethylenediamines, piperazines, phenothiazines and piperidines, all of which have characteristic metabolic fates. The former four categories undergo primarily cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative N-desalkylations and deamination whereas the aromatic rings of the latter two undergo P450-mediated oxidative hydroxylation and/or epoxide formation. The common tertiary amino group is susceptible to oxidative metabolism by flavin containing monooxygenases forming N-oxides, and the alicyclic tertiary amines produce small amounts (up to 7%) of N-glucuronides in humans. Species, sex and racial differences in the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of antihistamines are known. Specific P450-isozymes implicated in the metabolism were identified in a few cases, such as CYP2D6 that contributes to the metabolism of promethazine, diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine. Low circulating plasma concentrations of antihistamines are in part explained by significant first-pass effect and tissue distribution. Antihistaminic effects last up to 6 hours though some compounds exhibit a longer duration of action due to circulating active metabolites. Importantly, diphenhydramine inhibited CYP2D6 leading to a clinically significant drug-drug interaction with metoprolol. Other classic antihistamines were shown to be potent in vitro inhibitors of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. The prescription-free access to most classic antihistamines can easily lead to their co-administration with other drugs metabolized by the same enzyme system thereby leading to drug accumulation and adverse effects. In depth knowledge of the metabolic pathways of classic antihistamines and the enzymes involved is crucial to prevent the high incidence of drug interactions in humans, which are predictable based on pre-clinical data but unexpected when such data is unavailable.",5,E

This article summarizes those indices with a focus on newer non-invasive methods and provides an overview of physiological, pathological and pharmacological influences on arterial hemodynamics. In the near future, the ability to detect and monitor subclinical arterial damage will improve cardiovascular risk stratification and act as a better guide in assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions than monitoring blood pressure alone.

Guidelines recommend neurohormonal antagonists for treatment and stress the importance of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and beta-blockade in reversing the cardiac remodeling process. beta-Blockade slows or reverses the adverse effects resulting from chronic adrenergic stimulation. Traditionally, beta-blockers were reserved for mild-to-moderate heart failure, based on evidence from large, randomized clinical trials showing their positive effects on myocardial function and clinical outcomes. More recently, clinical data reveal that the agents can be expanded to patients with severe heart failure and those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction after myocardial infarction.

Risk factors for heart failure include coronary artery disease and other atherosclerotic vascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, renal insufficiency, obesity, and family history of cardiomyopathy. Essential strategies for prevention of heart failure are modification of risk factors for heart failure development; comprehensive hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes treatment; and detection and treatment of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. The B-type natriuretic peptide assay may aid in identifying asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in patients with risk factors for heart failure. In patients with hypertension, atherosclerosis, and/or diabetes, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, beta-blocker, aspirin, and statin therapy can prevent progression to symptomatic heart failure.

These differences may also interfere with treatment and management. In this review sex differences and similarities have been analyzed focusing on epidemiology, drug therapy and psychological implications. Pathophysiological differences but also a selection bias are evident; such differences bear an influence on clinical management. Gender differences exist even in the health-related quality of life, depression and coping ability. No studies have been specifically designed to investigate gender differences and the exclusion of elderly persons (mainly women) from large trials may compromise the quality of their care.",5,E

Little is known about the influence of different therapies for cardiac failure on the remodelling seen in infants with congenital cardiac disease.; During follow-up of a prospective and randomized trial, we investigated therapeutic effects on neurohormonal activation, ventricular function, and myocardial gene expression. We compared the data from 8 infants with severe congestive heart failure due to left-to-right shunts, who received digoxin and diuretics alone, to 9 infants who received additional treatment with propranolol.; In these infants, beta-adrenergic blockade significantly reduced highly elevated levels of renin, from 284 +/- 319 microU/ml compared to 1061 +/- 769 microU/ml. Systolic ventricular function was normal in both groups, but diastolic ventricular function was improved in those receiving propranolol, indicated by significantly lower left atrial pressures, lower end-diastolic pressures, and less pronounced ventricular hypertrophy, the latter estimated by lower ratios of myocardial wall to ventricular cavity areas on average of 42%. Further hemodynamic parameters showed no significant differences between the groups, except for the lower heart rate in infants treated with propranolol. In those treated with digoxin and diuretics, there was a significant downregulation of beta2-receptor and angiotensin-2 receptor genes, and up-regulation of endothelin A receptor and connective tissue growth factor genes, that were partially prevented by additional treatment with propranolol.; Beta-blockade is a new therapeutic approach for congestive heart failure in infants with congenital cardiac disease, producing with significant benefits on neurohormonal activation, diastolic ventricular function, and cardiac remodelling.",4,E

Beta-blockers are best deployed as a form of tertiary prevention in heart failure but have a very limited role for the treatment of a heart failure crisis. Physicians and patients need to understand the time course of the effects of beta-blocker therapy. The initial effects are often neutral or adverse, though the benefits, at least of carvedilol, may be apparent within days in patients with severe heart failure. Benefits accumulate gradually over a period of weeks to months. Some patience, perseverance, and education are required in order to allow patients to reap the full benefits of beta-blocker therapy for this malignant disease. Initiation of treatment early in the course of the disease maximizes the effectiveness and acceptance of therapy. Trials are under way to determine whether the benefits of beta-blockers extend to patients over 80 years of age and to those with preserved LV systolic function. It is likely that important differences exist between beta-blockers in terms of their clinical benefit, though whether differences exist between the agents that have been reported to be effective so far awaits the outcome of a large clinical trial. It is unclear whether the target doses of beta-blockers currently recommended are optimal.",5,E

A total of 86 patients who were SUDS survivors and probable SUDS survivors were randomized to receive an ICD or propranolol (20 patients were in the pilot study and 66 were in the main trial). The primary end point was death from all causes. The secondary end point was recurrent ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VF) or cardiac arrest. During the 3-year follow-up period of the main trial, there were 4 deaths; all occurred in the beta-blocker group (P=0.02). Seven subjects in the ICD arm had recurrent VF, and all were effectively treated by the ICD. On the basis of the main trial results, the Data Safety Monitoring Board stopped the study. In total (both from the Pilot study and the main trial), there were 7 deaths (18%) in the beta-blocker group and no deaths in the ICD group, but there were a total of 12 ICD patients receiving ICD discharges due to recurrent VF.; ICD treatment provides full protection from death related to primary VF in a SUDS population and is superior to beta-blockade treatment.",4,E

Hypertension, renal anemia, and comorbid conditions such as coronary artery disease are particularly important risk factors for CHF in ESRD. Dialysis hypotension may be a marker of poor prognosis in such persons. Recent studies suggest that lipid peroxidation and L-carnitine deficiency may contribute to CHF in some patients with ESRD. All forms of renal replacement therapy are capable of ameliorating symptoms of CHF, but their effect on cardiovascular mortality has not been firmly established.

They are usually the drugs of choice to treat a migraine attack in progress. Different triptans are available in various strengths and formulations, including oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal sprays and subcutaneous injections. In Europe, sumatriptan is also available as a suppository. Specific differences among the triptans exist, as evidenced by different pharmacological profiles including half-life, time to peak plasma concentrations, peak plasma concentrations, area under the concentration-time curve, metabolism and drug-drug interaction profiles. How or whether these differences translate to clinical efficacy and tolerability advantages for one agent over another is not well differentiated. However, delivery systems may play an important role in onset of action. Given that the clinical distinctions among these agents are subtle, identification of the most appropriate triptan for an individual patient requires consideration of the specific characteristics of the patient and knowledge of patient preference, an accurate history of the efficacy of previous acute-care medications and individual features of the drug being considered. The selection of an acute antimigraine drug also depends upon the stratification of the patient's migraine attack by peak intensity, time to peak intensity, level of associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, time to associated symptoms, comorbid diseases and concomitant treatments that might cause drug-drug interactions. Individual patient response to the triptans seems to be idiosyncratic and possibly genetically determined. Therefore, a set of specific questions can be used to determine whether a currently used triptan is optimally effective, whether the dose needs to be increased or whether another triptan should be tried. The clinician has in his/her armamentarium an ever-expanding variety of triptans, available in multiple formulations and dosages, which have good safety and tolerability profiles. Continued clinical use will yield familiarity with the various triptans, and it should become possible for the interested physician to match individual patient needs with the specific characteristics of a triptan to optimise therapeutic benefit. Use of the methods outlined in this review in choosing a triptan for an individual patient is probably more likely to lead to migraine relief than making an educated guess as to which triptan is most appropriate.",5,E

We discuss the therapeutic consequences of targeting PP rather than systolic (S) or diastolic (D) blood pressure (BP) when using antihypertensive agents. With this line of evidence it is important, first, to determine what minimal PP level indicates cardiovascular risk and, second, to note that an increasing number of clinical studies indicate that PP is poorly sensitive to placebo, while SBP and DBP are conversely highly sensitive. Finally, on the basis of large-scale intervention trials, PP seems to be an appropriate tool for studies of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics in the fields of hypertension, congestive heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases.",5,E

It is the most common type of syncope. The pathophysiology of neurocardiogenic syncope is complex and not completely elucidated. Individuals susceptible to neurocardiogenic syncope are unable to maintain the adaptive neurocardiovascular responses to upright posture for prolonged periods. These patients tend to have a modest reduction in central blood volume, which is aggravated by upright posture. It is often noted in individuals receiving sympathetic blocking agents and vasodilator drugs for hypertension, elderly patients receiving tranquilizers, patients with anemia, and individuals with tran- sient reductions in blood volume such as those that occur after a brisk diuresis or blood donation. The classic syncopal episode often is preceded by a constellation of prodromal symptoms several seconds before the event that may include nausea, headache, diaphoresis, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, and paresthesia.; Head-up tilt testing has become the diagnostic study of choice for the identification of patients with neurocardiogenic syncope.

Therefore, prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy has become a prominent goal in the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus. Preventive treatment should begin no later than at the stage of microalbuminuria, and regular screening for microalbuminuria is recommended for all patients with diabetes, irrespective of age. Improved metabolic control has been demonstrated to lower urinary albumin excretion. Target glycosylated haemoglobin levels should be below 7%, or 1% above the upper limit of normal of non-diabetic subjects. The use of an intensified treatment regimen is recommended. Insulin therapy has no adverse effects on renal indexes. To preserve renal function in older diabetic patients, blood pressure should be kept at or below 130/80 mm Hg. Treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (angiotensin II receptor blockers; ARBs) is superior to other pharmacological therapy, and should be initiated as first-line treatment. Most of the calcium channel antagonists have been found to increase or to have no effect on microalbuminuria despite blood pressure reduction. Moreover, there is substantial controversy as to whether they may be associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity. Non-dihydropyridine derivatives and calcium channel antagonists, such as nitrendipine, may be nephroprotective and have favourable effects on patients outcomes. A renoprotective action of diuretics may be confined to indapamide. Although beta-adrenoreceptor blockers are effective antihypertensive agents, they may not adequately preserve kidney function in older diabetic patients. However, as add-on treatment to ACE inhibitors or ARBs, they are particularly beneficial in nephropathic patients at risk of cardiovascular disease or with arrhythmias, in whom they may prove life-saving.",5,E

After using timolol maleate 0.5% monotherapy twice a day for 2 weeks, patients (n = 146) with an early morning intraocular pressure (IOP) between 22 and 28 mm Hg, inclusively, received unoprostone isopropyl 0.15% (n = 50), brimonidine tartrate 0.2% (n = 48), or dorzolamide hydrochloride 2.0% (n = 48) twice daily as adjunctive therapy to timolol maleate 0.5% for another 12 weeks. Safety was based on comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, adverse events, and vital signs. Efficacy was based on mean change from baseline in the 8 hour diurnal IOP at week 12. Baseline was defined as values obtained after 2 weeks of timolol monotherapy.; Each drug was safe and well tolerated. Burning/stinging was the most common treatment emergent adverse event. No clinically relevant changes from baseline were observed for any ophthalmic examination or vital signs. At week 12, each adjunctive therapy produced statistically significant (p<0.001) reductions from timolol treated baseline in the mean 8 hour diurnal IOP (-2.7 mm Hg, unoprostone; -2.8 mm Hg, brimonidine; -3.1 mm Hg, dorzolamide). The extent of IOP reduction did not differ significantly between unoprostone and either brimonidine (p = 0.154) or dorzolamide (p = 0.101).; Unoprostone was safe and well tolerated and provided a clinically and statistically significant additional reduction in IOP when added to stable monotherapy with timolol. Furthermore, unoprostone was not significantly different from brimonidine and dorzolamide as adjunctive therapy to timolol.",3,E

The findings were compared with that of a previous study conducted in the same tertiary hospital 10 years earlier. A cross-sectional evaluation of blood pressure (BP) control in a hypertension clinic was undertaken among 150 Nigerian patients aged 61 +/- 12 years (55% females), with a duration of treatment on a particular drug class or combination of 9 +/- 3 months. The initial blood pressure was 176 +/- 20/108 +/- 11 mmHg and 22% of the patient had concurrent diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics (D) alone or in combination remained the most commonly prescribed drugs in 56% of all patients. There were significant increases in the prescriptions of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (51%), P < 0.0001, and ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) (24%), P < 0.0001, but a slight reduction in the use of methyldopa, and fixed drug combinations (P < 0.01) compared to the previous study. The fall in systolic blood pressure on D (r = 0.65, P < 0.001) or CCB (r = 0.48, P < 0.02) was significantly correlated with the initial systolic blood pressure, but not age. More patients achieved normotension BP < 140/90 mmHg on CCB monotherapy (71%), than D monotherapy (56%). Combination therapy with ACEIs + D or methyldopa+thiazides normalized BP in 63 and 68%, respectively. Pulse pressure, a surrogate marker for cardiovascular complications and mortality in essential hypertension, was significantly reduced (P < 0.01) equally by all treatments, with 95% confidence intervals ranging from -28 to -1 mmHg. However, hypertensive-diabetic (HT-DM) patients (n = 33) exhibited no significant change in pulse pressure in response to treatment. Adverse drug reactions that occurred in 11% were impotence or postural dizziness with D, headache and pitting oedema with CCB, and dry cough with ACEI. Pharmaco-economic comparison of the drug classes revealed that for every US dollar (dollar) spent per month, the percentage of treated patients attaining normotension was 18.6 for D, 4.73 for CCB, 3.5 for ACEI + D and 13.6 for methyldopa + thiazides. A combination of ACEI + CCB or D was the preferred treatment for hypertensive-diabetic Nigerians, but only 24% attained a BP < 130/85 mmHg. These results demonstrate a shift in trend to a more rational and efficacious treatment of hypertension over a 10 year period. This may be associated, at least in part, with the intensive and continuous education of the prescribers in rational drug use and the introduction of a hospital formulary. Methyldopa is still a highly efficacious and cost-effective drug in this population. Black HT-DM Africans still constitute a subgroup who not only require more and costlier antihypertensive drugs, but whose BP control is suboptimal, and exhibit a poor therapeutic response to other risk factors (pulse pressure) that constitute a continuing risk for cardiovascular mortality.",5,E

The main symptoms of LQTS are pre-syncopal or syncopal attacks and cardiac arrest. Anti-adrenergic therapy with beta-blockers has been the mainstay of treatment. Left cardiac sympathectomy has also been used as an alternative in those in whom beta-blockers failed. ICDs are highly effective in preventing mortality and should be the first choice of therapy for those with cardiac arrest as the first symptom or those with LQT3 genotype not responding to anti-adrenergic therapy alone. Research on new therapeutic options, specifically those targeting at defective genes or mutant ion channels, may provide more effective treatment for this rare but potentially fatal electrophysiological disorder.",5,E

Significant advances in the understanding of this syncopal disorder have occurred in the past decade, and the list of medications recommended has changed, reflecting the evolving understanding of the pathophysiology and development of agents with enhanced efficacy and fewer adverse effects. Clinicians have few randomized controlled trials available to guide their decisions about treating neurocardiogenic syncope, and even fewer when it comes to medications targeting the pediatric population. At the present time, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, fludrocortisone, and also specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors and midodrine, appear to be favored treatment options. Ideally, specific therapy would be tailored to specific pathophysiologic mechanisms. Unfortunately, at present, specific treatments based on those abnormalities have not been identified.",5,E

If necessary, hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) was added to each compound. We evaluated brachial artery flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent dilation (high-resolution ultrasound) compared with endothelium-independent response to glyceryl trinitrate (25 microg/s). Brachial artery diameter was measured by automatic computerized analysis. Forty healthy subjects were evaluated as a control group. Oxidative stress production was evaluated by measuring plasma malondialdehyde and plasma lipoperoxides; plasma antioxidant capacity was assessed as ferric-reducing antioxidant power. Hypertensive patients showed a significantly (P<0.01) lower flow-mediated dilation (5.2+/-1.9%) as compared with healthy control subjects (7.1+/-2.6%). Response to glyceryl trinitrate was similar in control subjects and patients. At baseline, blood pressure, diameter, flow-mediated dilation, and response to glyceryl trinitrate were similar in the different treatment groups. All treatments similarly reduced blood pressure, but only perindopril increased flow mediated dilation (from 5.1+/-2 to 6.4+/-2.4%; P<0.01) without modifying the response to glyceryl trinitrate. Perindopril but also telmisartan nifedipine and amlodipine reduced oxidative stress and increased plasma antioxidant capacity.

Importantly, this was despite a mean blood pressure reduction which was similar in both groups. Furthermore, the atenolol arm was associated with higher incidence of newly diagnosed diabetics. The LIFE study has firmly confirmed a place for losartan (and other angiotensin receptor blockers) in the management of hypertension. Losartan has also been shown to be effective in diabetics and in patients with atrial fibrillation, as well as in left ventricular hypertrophy regression.

Incomplete suppression of the SNS may contribute to the residual mortality during optimal ACE inhibitor therapy in CHF. Carvedilol, a mixed alpha and beta-blocker with antioxidant properties, and other pure beta-adrenoceptor blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in Caucasians with CHF. However, beta-blocker monotherapy is of poor efficacy in Blacks with essential hypertension or in the treatment of glaucoma. The efficacy of beta-blockers in the treatment of African Americans with congestive heart failure is a controversial issue with conflicting findings. The aims of the present study were to examine and compare the cardiovascular, autonomic, and clinical effects of additional alpha-1, or beta-1 blockade in ACE-inhibitor treated Black patients with moderate to severe CHF.; Twenty-eight Nigerian patients with chronic CHF stabilized on digoxin and diuretics, were randomized to 3 groups of similar demographics according to a single blind, parallel group design. The patients were aged 53 +/- 6 years, and comprised 14 men and 14 women, with a mean cardiothoracic ratio of 0.66 +/- 0.03, and ejection fraction of 0.38 +/- 0.10, 60% hypertensive etiology. Group 1 patients received 5 mg enalapril alone, group 2 received 5 mg enalapril + 1 mg prazosin, and group 3 received 5 mg enalapril + 50 mg atenolol. All medication was taken daily for 4 weeks. Blood pressure, heart rate, pressure rate product, 6-minute walk test, NYHA class, and cardiac autonomic reflexes were measured at baseline and again at 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA, and a one-way ANOVA were used in data analysis.; The 3 treatments caused significant (P<.001 ANOVA) and similar improvements for the NYHA class (-1.0 to -1.6), and increased the 6-minute distance covered (+130 m to +205 m). Although no treatment differences were observed, a trend suggesting a greater improvement with enalapril + atenolol became apparent. By the fourth week, the sympathoplegic treatments, enalapril + atenolol, and enalapril + prazosin, caused significant reductions in the pressure rate product (-3726 +/- 1885 mm Hg x beats/min; -3498 +/- 396 mm Hg beats/min, respectively), (compared to enalapril alone (-1349 +/- 894 mm Hg x beats/min) (P<.001 ANOVA). During the Valsalva maneuver, the phase IV bradycardia were significantly greater after treatment with enalapril + atenolol (944 +/- 66 msec) or with enalapril + prazosin (825 +/- 48 msec), compared to enalapril alone (760 +/- 45 msec) (P<.001 ANOVA). The phase II Valsalva tachycardia were similar between treatments. The respiratory sinus arrhythmia ratio increased significantly (P<.005 ANOVA) and equally on all treatments. However, the pressor and chronotropic responses to forearm isometric handgrip increased significantly on the enalapril + prazosin combination (P<.02), compared to the other treatments.; Our findings demonstrated not only the safety of providing additional therapy with alpha-1 or beta-1 receptor blockade concurrent with ACE inhibition in Blacks with CHF, but also the resultant improvement in exercise tolerance and NYHA class. Compared to using ACE inhibition alone, the combined therapies caused a marked reduction in the pressure rate product, an index of myocardial oxygen consumption, and a greater enhancement of cardiac parasympathetic activity. Selective beta-1 blockade caused a greater enhancement of central baroreceptor vagal activity compared to alpha-1 blockade. Conversely, the pressor and chronotropic abnormalities during forearm isometric handgrip in CHF, were normalized by alpha-1, but not beta-1, blockade. Thus, the combined reflex cardiac vagal augmentation following selective beta-1 blockade, and the hemodynamic effects of alpha-1 antagonism with concurrent ACE inhibition, may be of major therapeutic and prognostic benefit in Blacks with non-ischemic (hypertensive) CHF stabilized on digoxin and diuretics.",I,7

Most chronically depressed people are not absolutely resistant but are relatively resistant to treatment; they fail to achieve the goals of treatment because of improper diagnosis or insufficient treatment application. The literature on TRD has largely focused on medication strategies; fewer studies investigated psychosocial approaches. The best established augmentation strategies are lithium salts and triidothyronine (T3). Combination antidepressants have become clinical psychiatrists' preferred treatment, despite limited evidence.

Asthma is frequently overlooked in the geriatric population. Objective measures of pulmonary function can aid in a prompt diagnosis and lead to effective treatment and improved quality of life. Because smoking is an important risk factor for asthma-like symptoms of wheezing, cough, and sputum production, asthma is frequently confused with COPD. When airflow obstruction is found, attempts to demonstrate reversibility can uncover an asthmatic component to the disease. In patients who have asthma symptoms and no airflow obstruction, methacholine testing is helpful. When a normal methacholine challenge is present, a diagnosis of asthma can be excluded and the physician can pursue other diagnostic considerations such as heart failure, chronic aspiration syndrome, pulmonary embolic disease, and carcinoma of the lung. The onset of wheezing, shortness of breath, and cough in an elderly patient is likely to cause concern.

The arms are the most common body part affected and cause the most functional disability. The treatment of essential tremor includes medications, surgical options and other forms of therapy. Presently there is no cure for essential tremor nor are there any medications that can slow the progression of tremor. Treatment for essential tremor is recommended if the tremor causes functional disability. If the tremor is disabling only during periods of stress and anxiety, propranolol and benzodiazepines can be used during those periods when the tremor causes functional disability. The currently available medications can improve tremor in approximately 50% of the patients. If the tremor is disabling, treatment should be initiated with either primidone or propranolol. If either primidone or propranolol do not provide adequate control of the tremor, then the medications can be used in combination. If patients experience adverse effects with propranolol, occasionally other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (such as atenolol or metoprolol) can be used. If primidone and propranolol do not provide adequate control of tremor, occasionally the use of benzodiazepines (such as clonazepam) can provide benefit. Other medications that may be helpful include gabapentin or topiramate. If a patient has disabling head or voice tremor, botulinum toxin injections into the muscles may provide relief from the tremor. Botulinum toxin in the hand muscles for hand tremor can result in bothersome hand weakness and is not widely used. There are other medications that have been tried in essential tremor and have questionable efficacy. These drugs include carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. methazolamide), phenobarbital, calcium channel antagonists (e.g. nimodipine), isoniazid, clonidine, clozapine and mirtazapine. If the patient still has disabling tremor after medication trials, surgical options are usually considered. Surgical options include thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation of the thalamus. These surgical options provide adequate tremor control in approximately 90% of the patients. Surgical morbidity and mortality for these procedures is low. Deep brain stimulation and thalamotomy have been shown to have comparable efficacy but fewer complications have been reported with deep brain stimulation. In patients undergoing bilateral procedures deep brain stimulation of the thalamus is the procedure of choice to avoid adverse effects seen with bilateral ablative procedures. The use of medication and/or surgery can provide adequate tremor control in the majority of the patients.",5,E

Their neuroradiological findings (ischemic and hemorrhagic changes) and functional outcome at 3 months were evaluated.; Sixty-one percent of the patients had recovered functional independence (Barthel Index 95 to 100) at the 3-month follow-up. On the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), 37% (28/75) of patients had no or minimal symptoms (mRS 0 to 1), while 17% (13/75) remained dependent (mRS 4 to 5) and 5% (4/75) died. Cerebral parenchymal hematomas occurred in 8% (6/75) and hemorrhagic transformation in 8% (6/75) of the patients. Low initial diastolic blood pressure and administration of intravenous antihypertensive medication were associated with unfavorable outcome (mRS 3 to 6).; We conclude that our management protocol for thrombolytic therapy is safe.

Vasodilatation of the systemic and splanchnic circulations leads to a reduced total systemic vascular resistance, increased cardiac output and intense activation of neurohumoral vasoconstrictor systems including the sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin system and vasopressin. Vasoconstriction of the renal and hepatic circulations contributes to the development of renal failure and portal hypertension, respectively. Current treatments that focus on amelioration of these circulatory derangements offer much promise, however, they are often limited by side effects in these patients.",5,E

According to the ""response to injury"" hypothesis, endothelial dysfunction is the early event that allows penetration of lipids and inflammatory cells into the arterial wall, contributing to the development of the atherosclerotic lesion. Endothelial dysfunction is causally related to a variety of risk factors for atherosclerosis, including hyperlipidaemia and hypertension. Agents that restore endothelial function and NO bioavailability have beneficial anti-atherogenic activities and can improve cardiovascular outcomes; this has been observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins and certain dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers (CCBs). In the Prospective Randomised Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT), the CCB amlodipine provided significant clinical benefits compared with placebo, including a marked reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and a reduction in the progression of carotid atherosclerosis. As these beneficial effects of amlodipine have not been observed with other dihydropyridine-type CCBs, it has been proposed that this agent has distinct anti-atherosclerotic properties related to its strong lipophilicity and membrane location. Experimental support for this hypothesis has been obtained from various in vitro and in vivo models of atherosclerosis. These findings support a broader therapeutic role for third-generation dihydropyridine-type CCBs in the treatment of atherosclerosis.",5,E

Over the subsequent 25 years, over 30 large clinical trials have extended these initial observations to allow us to conclude that treatment of mild, moderate or severe hypertension, and isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly, all produce important absolute benefits. In addition, excellent specific evidence of benefit is now accumulating for certain groups of normotensive patients, including those with previous stroke, and those with established cardiovascular disease. Although the importance of vigorous antihypertensive therapy for the primary and secondary prevention of stroke is increasingly clear, a large number of unanswered questions remain. For example, while it is apparent that diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are all effective antihypertensive agents, the question remains as to which drug, or combination of drugs, is best for which patients. The results of several ongoing comparative trials of different drug regimens, including the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), may elucidate this further.",5,E
12740554,Blood pressure and lipid lowering in the prevention of stroke: a note to neurologists.,"Cooperative Behavior; Humans; Hyperlipidemias; Hypertension; Neurology; Physician's Role; Physicians, Family; Stroke","Amarenco, Pierre","Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and dependency in western society. Despite the determined efforts of basic science and clinical investigators, neuroprotective therapies for acute stroke have yet to be realised. Stroke prevention, therefore, remains the key route for reducing morbidity and mortality. Hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia are the most important modifiable risk factors for stroke. Several recent landmark studies have shown that lipid lowering with statins can reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke, as well as coronary heart disease. In addition, clinical trials evaluating the effects of blood pressure lowering have shown that antihypertensive agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists can reduce stroke risk. Accumulating evidence suggests certain antihypertensive agents such as CCBs might also prevent the formation and progression of carotid atheroma, independently of their blood-pressure-lowering effects. It follows that rigorous identification and targeting of high- risk or stroke-prone individuals for blood pressure and lipid-lowering interventions should be of practical importance to all physicians involved in the management of stroke.",5,E

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most prevalent form of glaucoma and has a particularly devastating impact in blacks. In the black American population, POAG prevalence is estimated to be six times as high in certain age groups compared to whites. POAG is more likely to result in irreversible blindness, appears approximately 10 years earlier and progresses more rapidly in blacks than in whites. Racial differences in optic disk parameters have been reported and show that blacks have larger optic disks than whites. This finding is robust and may account for the reported differences in other optic disk parameters. The existence of racial differences in intraocular pressure remains to be demonstrated, as conflicting findings are reported in the literature. Intraocular pressure may actually be underestimated in blacks, perhaps because they have thinner corneas. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension is higher in blacks than in whites, and although no causal relationship has been established between POAG and each of these systemic diseases, some reports suggest that they often occur together, perhaps through an indirect relationship with intraocular pressure. Compounding the problem, there is evidence that blacks are less responsive to both drug and surgical treatment for POAG. Finally, they often have reduced accessibility to treatment and are less aware of the risks of having POAG. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current knowledge pertaining to POAG in blacks.",5,E

Despite this, women at all ages receive less treatment, less attention and not enough information about health risks. Most risk factors, e.g. hypertension, elevated blood lipid levels, diabetes and changes in oestrogen levels, differ between women and men. As a consequence of this, secondary prevention from coronary artery disease is likely to have different effects in women to those in men.

The following are the key messages(1) In persons older than 50 years, systolic blood pressure (BP) of more than 140 mm Hg is a much more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; (2) The risk of CVD, beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, doubles with each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; individuals who are normotensive at 55 years of age have a 90% lifetime risk for developing hypertension; (3) Individuals with a systolic BP of 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of 80 to 89 mm Hg should be considered as prehypertensive and require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent CVD; (4) Thiazide-type diuretics should be used in drug treatment for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes. Certain high-risk conditions are compelling indications for the initial use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); (5) Most patients with hypertension will require 2 or more antihypertensive medications to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mm Hg, or <130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease); (6) If BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above goal BP, consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 2 agents, 1 of which usually should be a thiazide-type diuretic; and (7) The most effective therapy prescribed by the most careful clinician will control hypertension only if patients are motivated. Motivation improves when patients have positive experiences with and trust in the clinician. Empathy builds trust and is a potent motivator. Finally, in presenting these guidelines, the committee recognizes that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.",I,8

Open-angle glaucoma is an asymptomatic, progressive optic neuropathy characterized by enlarging optic disc cupping and visual field loss. Patients at increased risk for open-angle glaucoma include blacks older than 40 years, whites older than 65 years, and persons with a family history of glaucoma or a personal history of diabetes or severe myopia. Elevated intraocular pressure is a strong, modifiable risk factor for open-angle glaucoma, but it is not diagnostic. Some patients with glaucoma have normal intraocular pressure (i.e., normal-pressure glaucoma), and many patients with elevated intraocular pressure do not have glaucoma (i.e., glaucoma suspects). Routine measurement of intraocular pressure by primary care physicians to screen patients for glaucoma is not recommended. Open-angle glaucoma usually is discovered during an adult eye evaluation performed for other indications. Final diagnosis and treatment occur in collaboration with ophthalmologists and optometrists. Formal visual field testing (perimetry) is a mainstay of glaucoma diagnosis and management. Eye drops, commonly nonspecific beta-blocker or prostaglandin analog drops, generally are the first-line treatment to reduce intraocular pressure. Laser treatment and surgery usually are reserved for patients in whom medical treatment has failed. Without treatment, open-angle glaucoma can end in irreversible vision loss.",5,E

The incremental cost effectiveness of prescribing ACE inhibitor therapy to everybody was never less than $US 100,000/QALY in the sensitivity analysis.; Prescribing ACE inhibitors as antihypertensive first-line therapy in patients without cardiovascular morbidity cannot be recommended at the present time unless the acquisition costs of ACE inhibitors become substantially more attractive.",5,E

Forty-nine patients were randomized to AVJAP while 50 patients were randomized to pharmacologic control. The primary end point was cardiac function measured by echocardiography and exercise tolerance. The secondary end points were ventricular rate control, evaluated by 24-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, and quality of life. Data were collected at randomization and then at one month, six months, and 12 months post-randomization.; At 12 months follow-up there was no significant difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (AVJAP: 54 +/- 17%; MED: 61 +/- 13% [p = ns]) or exercise duration on treadmill testing (AVJAP: 4.1 +/- 2 min; MED: 4.6 +/- 2 min [p = ns]); however, the peak ventricular rate was lower in the AVJAP group during exercise (112 +/- 17 beats/min vs. 153 +/- 36 beats/min, p < 0.05) and activities of daily life (117 +/- 16 beats/min vs. 152 +/- 37 beats/min, p < 0.05).

The eye presents unique opportunities and challenges when it comes to the delivery of pharmaceuticals, and is most accessible to the application of topical medications. While absorption by this route is inefficient, there are few side effects. While it has been assumed that topically applied drugs penetrated into the intraocular environment through the cornea, this is currently being reassessed. More recent investigations have shown that the conjunctival route of entry plays an important role in the penetration of drugs into the anterior segment. Furthermore, topically applied drugs have been shown to have access to the sclera from the conjunctiva. As such, it is conceivable that such drugs could find their way to the posterior segment. Data suggest that the sclera is readily permeable to even large molecular weight compounds ( approximately 150 kD). The recent finding that topically applied nepafenac inhibited choroidal and retinal neovascularization by decreasing the production of VEGF, as well as our data showing that even a large molecular weight peptide like insulin can accumulate in the retina and optic nerve after topical application, supports the contention that topically applied drugs can not only reach the posterior segment, but that they can also be therapeutic. Finally, the implications of our findings that topically applied insulin also accumulates in the contralateral eye as well as in the central nervous system are discussed.",5,E

Clinical studies have shown that intracoronary (IC) propranolol administration before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) delays myocardial ischemia. The present study tested the hypothesis that IC propranolol treatment protects ischemic myocardium from myocardial damage and reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and short-term adverse outcomes after PCI.; Patients undergoing PCI (n=150) were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive IC propranolol (n=75) or placebo (n=75). Study drug was delivered before first balloon inflation via an intracoronary catheter with the tip distal to the coronary lesion.

IOP was measured at baseline and 2 hours after morning instillation at weeks 2, 4, and 12. The primary outcome measure was the mean IOP reduction from baseline. Secondary measures were the percentage of patients in each group who achieved specific low target pressures and the incidence of adverse events. Mean IOP at baseline was 24.8 mm Hg in each group. At follow-up visits, mean reductions from baseline ranged from 8.5 to 9.0 mm Hg with brimP/bim and from 7.5 to 7.7 mm Hg with tim/latan. More patients achieved low target pressures with brimP/bim. At week 12, 69.2% of brimP/bim patients and 27.3% of tim/latan patients had IOPs of 16 mm Hg or lower (P = .024). Both regimens were well tolerated, and adverse events were infrequent.

Treatment with isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-MN) plus propranolol achieves a greater reduction in portal pressure than propranolol alone. The present multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial evaluated whether combined drug therapy could be more effective than propranolol alone in preventing variceal bleeding. A total of 349 consecutive cirrhotic patients with gastroesophageal varices were randomized to receive propranolol + placebo (n = 174) or propranolol + IS-MN (n = 175). There were no significant differences in the 1- and 2-year actuarial probability of variceal bleeding between the 2 groups (propranolol + placebo, 8.3% and 10.6%; propranolol + IS-MN, 5% and 12.5%). The only independent predictor of variceal bleeding was a variceal size greater than 5 mm. However, among patients with varices greater than 5 mm (n = 196), there were no significant differences in the incidence of variceal bleeding between the 2 groups. Survival was also similar. Adverse effects were significantly more frequent in the propranolol + IS-MN group due to a greater incidence of headache. There were no significant differences in the incidence of new-onset or worsening ascites or in impairment of renal function. In conclusion, propranolol effectively prevents variceal bleeding. Adding IS-MN does not further decrease the low residual risk of bleeding in patients receiving propranolol. However, the long-term use of this combination drug therapy is safe and may be an alternative in clinical conditions associated with a greater risk of bleeding.",3,E

Patients were then switched to the other treatment regimen. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were measured every 2 hours between 08 : 00 and 20 : 00 hours at baseline and at the end of periods 1 and 2.; This study found that in 32 subjects the IOP diurnal curve on timolol alone (20.9 +/- 2.8 mmHg) decreased to 17.9 +/- 3.2 mmHg when patients were treated with TLFC and to 19.0 +/- 2.4 mmHg when patients were treated with brimonidine and timolol (p = 0.02). Intraocular pressures at individual time-points were statistically similar between the groups at the 08 : 00 trough and 2 and 4 hours after dosing.

The rationale for their study in hypertension follows the observation that the major consequences of hypertension are stroke and myocardial infarction. However, the etiology of these consequences in hypertension is, paradoxically, not hemorrhagic (as might be expected from the effects of high blood pressure), but occlusive, with thrombus being the culprit lesion. Mechanisms of platelet activation include high shear force, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, endothelial changes, and the presence of comorbidity, such as atrial fibrillation. The treatment of high blood pressure brings about a reversal of the changes seen in the cell. This could be in part due to the direct effect of the drug on the megakaryocyte and/or the platelets themselves, or it might simply be due to the reduction in blood pressure. Some drugs, such as calcium channel antagonists and angiotensin II receptor blockers, however, might have direct effects on platelet biochemistry other than reducing blood pressure. Finally, antiplatelet drugs are becoming an important part of the management of high-risk hypertensives, which aim to minimize vascular complications.",5,E

The remodeling process manifests as an increase in left ventricular volumes, leading to a rise in wall stress and a compensatory increase in myocardial mass. The left ventricle also gradually assumes a more spherical shape, resulting in functional mitral regurgitation leading to further haemodynamic overload, worsening myocardial function and an unfavourable clinical course. Accumulating clinical data support the hypothesis that the benefits in clinical outcome with ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers may relate to modification of the remodeling process resulting in slowing of disease progression and preservation of contractile function. The general trend from a number of clinical studies indicates that whereas ACE-inhibitors seem to prevent progressive left ventricular dilatation, the third generation beta-blocker, carvedilol, may actually reverse the remodelling process by reducing left ventricular volumes and improving systolic function. Direct comparisons indicate that carvedilol has a similar safety and tolerability profile to ACE-inhibitors and thereby support the feasibility of administering this drug as first-line therapy in selected patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure. Therefore, the decision to initiate treatment with carvedilol or an ACE-inhibitor might in future be tailored on an individual basis and followed thereafter by combination therapy at the earliest and safest opportunity. Finally, the possible development of treatment strategies addressing the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the remodeling process and the recently published benefits of device therapies herald a combined, synergistic approach to the future management of heart failure.",5,E

Pharmacokinetics of propranolol CR and sustained-release propranolol after single and multiple doses were determined in normal male volunteers in this open-label, 2-period crossover study. The drugs were dosed in the evening and serial blood samples were taken for determination of propranolol concentration the next 24 to 72 hours. After a single 160-mg dose of propranolol CR administered at 10 pm, absorption was delayed by about 4 hours, after which plasma concentration rose steadily, reaching a peak at about 10:00 am. In contrast, after dosing with sustained release propranolol, plasma levels of propranolol began to rise almost immediately, reaching a plateau between 4:00 am and 10:00 am. During multiple dosing, steady-state trough plasma concentrations were achieved after 2 days with either drug.

12797840,Exercise in hypertension. A clinical review.,Exercise Therapy; Humans; Hypertension,"Wallace, Janet P","The current exercise prescription for the treatment of hypertension is: cardiovascular mode, for 20-60 minutes, 3-5 days per week, at 40-70% of maximum oxygen uptake (VO2(max)). Cardiovascular exercise training is the most effective mode of exercise in the prevention and treatment of hypertension. Resistance exercise is not the preferred mode of exercise treatment, but can be incorporated into an exercise regime provided the diastolic blood pressure response is within safe limits. It is inconclusive whether durations longer than 30 minutes produce significantly greater reductions in blood pressure. A frequency of three exercise sessions per week has been considered to be the minimal frequency for blood pressure reduction. Higher frequencies tended to produce greater reductions, although not significantly different. Evidence still exists that high intensity exercise (>75% VO2(max)) may not be as effective as low intensity exercise (<70% VO2(max)) in reducing elevated blood pressures. Exercise can be effective without a change in bodyweight or body fat. Bodyweight or body fat loss and anti-hypertensive medications do not have an added effect on blood pressure reduction associated with exercise. beta-blockade is not the recommended anti-hypertensive medication for effective exercise performance in non-cardiac patients. Not all hypertensive patients respond to exercise treatment. Differences in genetics and pathophysiology may be responsible for the inability of some hypertensive patients to respond to exercise. Ambulatory technology may allow advances in individualising a more effective exercise prescription for low-responders and non-responders.",5,E

Retrieved and personal data were compared with respect to methodology and interpreted according to present knowledge on cortical information processing. Results are in part contradictory which appears to be method-, patient- and disease- related. Nonetheless, both evoked potential and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies demonstrate that the cerebral cortex, and possibly subcortical structures, are dysfunctioning interictally in both migraine with and without aura. These electrophysiologic abnormalities tend to normalise just before and during an attack and some of them seem to have a clear familial and predisposing character. Besides the studies of magnetophosphenes which have yielded contrasting results, chiefly because the method is not sufficiently reliable, most recent electrophysiologic investigations of cortical activities in migraine favour deficient habituation and decreased preactivation cortical excitability as the predominant interictal dysfunctions. We propose that the former is a consequence of the latter and that it could favour both interictal cognitive disturbances as well as a cerebral metabolic disequilibrium that may play a role in migraine pathogenesis. To summarize, electrophysiologic studies demonstrate in migraine between attacks a cortical, and possibly subcortical, dysfunction of which the hallmark is deficient habituation.",5,E

We examined the effect of a Y1 receptor antagonist on haemodynamic and ischaemic responses to exercise in patients with coronary artery disease.; Eighty-two evaluable male patients were included in a randomized, double blind, two-way crossover study with a low dose (6.7 microg/kg/min; n=59)and a high dose (13.3 microg/kg/min; n=23) of the Y1 receptor antagonist AR-H040922 given as infusions for 2h or placebo. Myocardial ischaemia during a symptom-limited exercise test was monitored by conventional ST-segment analysis and heart rate (HR)-adjusted ST changes including the ST/HR slope and ST/HR recovery. Administration of the high dose AR-H040922 attenuated systolic blood pressure by 6-11 mmHg (p<0.05) during and after exercise without affecting HR. None of the two doses of AR-H040922 influenced any of the ischaemic parameters or duration of exercise, however. The maximal increase in NPY was higher during AR-H040922 (p<0.05) compared with placebo.; Selective NPY Y1 receptor blockade attenuates the increase in blood pressure during exercise indicating a role for endogenous NPY in blood pressure regulation. Despite this effect, the Y1 receptor antagonist did not influence exercise-induced ischaemic parameters in patients with coronary artery disease.",3,E
12806521,The triptan formulations: a critical evaluation.,Analgesics; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Serotonin Receptor Agonists,"Bigal, Marcelo E; Bordini, Carlos A; Antoniazzi, Ana L; Speciali, Jos茅 G","The migraine-specific triptans have revolutionized the treatment of migraine and are usually the drugs of choice to treat a migraine attack in progress. Different triptans are available in different strengths and formulations including oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal sprays and subcutaneous injections. In Europe, sumatriptan is also available as a suppository. Specific differences among the triptans exist as evidenced by different pharmacological profiles including T1/2, Tmax, Cmax, AUC, metabolism, drug-drug interaction profiles, amongst other parameters. How or whether these differences translate to clinical efficacy and tolerability differences is not well differentiated. Clinical distinctions among these agents are subtle and proper choice of triptan requires attention to the specific characteristics of each individual patient, knowledge of patient preference, accurate history of the efficacy of previous acute care medications as well as individual features of the drug being considered. Delivery systems may play an important role in the onset of action of triptans. The selection of an acute antimigraine drug for a patient depends upon the stratification of the patient's migraine attack by peak intensity, time to peak intensity, level of associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, time to associated symptoms, comorbid diseases, and concomitant treatments that might cause drug-drug interactions. The clinician has in his armamentarium an ever-expanding variety of medications, available in multiple formulations and dosages, with good safety and tolerability profiles. Continued clinical use will yield familiarity with the various triptans, and it should become possible for the interested physician to match individual patient needs with the specific characteristics of a triptan to optimize therapeutic benefit.",5,E

It then discusses the differential diagnosis of the sinus tachyarrhythmias (normal sinus tachycardia, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and sinus node reentry tachycardia), elaborates on their pathophysiologic basis, and provides up-to-date evidence-based information on their optimum management.

Adrenergic vasopressor agents produce systemic vasoconstriction. This increases aortic diastolic pressure, and consequently, coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures. The pharmacologic responses to the adrenergic agents are mediated by a group of receptors that are classified as alpha (alpha), including alpha1 and alpha2, and beta (beta), including beta1 and beta2. Epinephrine, which has each of these adrenergic actions, has been the preferred adrenergic agent for the management of cardiac arrest for almost 40 years. Its primary efficacy is due to its alpha-adrenergic vasopressor effects. This contrasts with its beta-adrenergic actions, which are inotropic, chronotropic, and vasodilator. Accordingly, beta-adrenergic actions prompt increases in myocardial oxygen consumption, ectopic ventricular arrhythmias, and transient hypoxemia due to pulmonary arteriovenous shunting. This may account for the failure to demonstrate that epinephrine improves ultimate outcomes in human victims of cardiac arrest. Major interest has more recently been focused on selective alpha-adrenergic agonists. Both alpha1-agonists and alpha2-agonists are peripheral vasopressors. However, rapid desensitization of alpha1-adrenergic receptors occurs during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Moreover, alpha1-adrenergic receptors are present in the myocardium, and beta1-agonists, like beta-adrenergic agonists, increase myocardial oxygen consumption. If they cross the blood-brain barrier, alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists also have centrally acting vasodilator effects. In the absence of central nervous system access, alpha2-adrenergic agonists have selective peripheral vasoconstrictor effects. Under experimental conditions of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, selective alpha2-agonists, which do not gain entrance into the brain, produce only systemic vasoconstriction. Experimentally, these selective alpha2-agonists are as effective as epinephrine for initial cardiac resuscitation and have the additional advantage of minimizing myocardial oxygen consumption during the global myocardial ischemia of cardiac arrest. Accordingly, myocardial ischemic injury during cardiopulmonary resuscitation is minimized, and postresuscitation myocardial function is preserved with improved survival.",5,E

This dual mechanism of action could result in minimum interference with lipid metabolism compared to atenolol, a classic beta1-selective blocker. Hypertensive patients commonly exhibit lipid abnormalities and frequently require statins in combination with the anti-hypertensive therapy. We conducted this trial in order to clarify the effect on the metabolic profile of beta-blocker therapy with atenolol or nebivolol alone, or in conjunction with pravastatin. Thirty hypertensive hyperlipidemic men and women (total cholesterol >240 mg/dL [6.2 mmol/L], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >190 mg/dL [4.9 mmol/L], triglycerides <500 mg/dL [5.6 mmol/L]) were separated in two groups. One group consisted of 15 subjects on atenolol therapy (50 mg daily), and the other group included 15 subjects on nebivolol therapy (5 mg daily). After 12 weeks of beta-blocker therapy, pravastatin (40 mg daily) was added in both groups for another 12 weeks. Atenolol significantly increased triglyceride levels by 19% (P=.05), while nebivolol showed a trend to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 8% (NS) and to decrease triglyceride levels by 5% (NS). Atenolol significantly increased lipoprotein(a) by 30% (P=.028). Fibrinogen levels were equally and not significantly decreased in both groups by 9% and 7%, respectively. Furthermore, atenolol and nebivolol decreased serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels by 14% (P=.05) and 15% (P=.05), respectively. On the other hand, both atenolol and nebivolol showed a trend to increase homocysteine levels (NS) by 13% and 11%, respectively. Although uric acid levels remained the same, atenolol significantly increased the fractional excretion of uric acid by 33% (P=.03). Following nebivolol administration, glucose levels remained the same, while insulin levels were reduced by 10% and the HOMA index (fasting glucose levels multiplied by fasting insulin levels and divided by 22.5) was reduced by 20% (P=.05). There were no significant differences between the two patient groups in the measured parameters after the administration of beta-blockers, except for triglycerides (P<.05) and the HOMA index (P=.05). The addition of pravastatin to all patients (n=30) decreased total cholesterol by 21% (P<.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 28% (P<.001), apolipoprotein-B by 22% (P<.001), apolipoprotein-E by 15% (P=.014) and lipoprotein(a) levels by 12% (P=.023). Moreover, homocysteine levels and C-reactive protein were reduced by 17% (P=.05) and 43% (P=.05), respectively. We conclude that nebivolol seems to be a more appropriate therapy in hypertensive patients with hyperlipidemia and carbohydrate intolerance. Finally, the addition of pravastatin could further correct the well-established predictors of cardiovascular events.",3,E

The mean (SD) duration of follow-up was 4.8 (0.9) years. Use of lipid-lowering therapy was at the discretion of the investigator. In the present study, analyses of baseline and end-of-study mean total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and statin use were performed for the combined treatment groups. Based on generally accepted guidelines, achievement of a TC level <5.0 mmol/L (193.5 mg/dL) was used as the treatment target for the purpose of these analyses. The proportions of patients with TC levels above this cutoff were calculated at baseline and at the final visit.; A total of 8653 patients had baseline and end-of-study cholesterol measurements and were included in this analysis.

Based on available morbidity and mortality data, posttransplantation hypertension must be identified and managed appropriately. During the past decade, calcium channel blockers have been recommended by some as the antihypertensive agents of choice in this population, because it was theorized that their vasodilatory effects would counteract the vasoconstrictive effects of the calcineurin inhibitors. With increasing data becoming available, reexamining the use of traditional antihypertensive agents, including diuretics and beta-blockers, or the newer agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, may be beneficial. Transplant clinicians must choose antihypertensive agents that will provide their patients with maximum benefit, from both a renal and a cardiovascular perspective. Beta-blockers, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors have all demonstrated significant benefit on morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease. Calcium channel blockers have been shown to possess the ability to counteract cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity. When compared with beta-blockers, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors, however, the relative risk of cardiovascular events is increased with calcium channel blockers. With the long-term benefits of calcium channel blockers on the kidney unknown and a negative cardiovascular profile, these agents are best reserved as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors.",5,E

Signal-averaged ECG recordings were obtained serially prior to thrombolytic therapy, 48 h after and 10 days later. Late potentials were defined as positive if signal-averaged ECG met at least two of Gomes criteria: filtered total QRS duration >114 ms, root mean square voltage of the last 40 ms of the QRS <20 mV, or the duration of the terminal low (<40 mV) amplitude signals >38 ms. Changes observed in signal-averaged ECG recordings after thrombolysis were evaluated statistically with regard to statin usage. There were no significant differences between the clinical characteristics of the two randomized groups. There was a significant decrease in the rates of late potentials between the first and third signal-averaged ECG recordings after thrombolytic therapy in pravastatin group. Pravastatin group also had lower incidence of ventricular arrhythmias compared with control group (26 vs. 63%, P=0.021). The in-hospital cardiovascular event rates were also lower in statin group.; Early use of pravastatin reduces the incidence of late potentials following thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. Statin therapy also seems to be reducing the incidence of in-hospital ventricular arrhythmias. These beneficial effects of statins might be explained through prevention of new myocardial ischemic episodes due to early plaque stabilization or regulation of endothelial and platelet functions.",3,E

People are now intolerant of small risks as well as the physical or mental discomforts from drug side effects. Safety and tolerability are now major forces driving the development of new medicines for the treatment of chronic illnesses and the prevention of increasingly rare events. For example, over the past decades, lower and lower treatment thresholds have been recommended in hypertension. Public perception of risk strongly influences the acceptability of lifetime treatment, especially for mild hypertension. This era has also witnessed great advances in the development of antihypertensive drugs that combine efficacy with unsurpassed tolerability. However, the philosophy of Scottish teachers of Materia medica still appears to be followed-'never be the first or the last to prescribe a new drug'. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists are as safe and as efficacious as other antihypertensive medications and better tolerated. Large trials (HOT, HOPE, UKPDS and PROGRESS) point to the need for rigorous control of blood pressure particularly in high-risk individuals. Antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system will probably impact significantly on achieving optimal blood pressure levels.

More importantly, intervention at this stage is now possible with the perspective of preserving glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and ameliorating cardiovascular disease and ensuing strong end-points. INITIAL STUDIES: The concept of microalbuminuria was introduced about 20 years ago and since then there has been a multitude of studies and papers on this subject using the original definition, but not always, in the US. Before that time it was suggested, mainly from the US, that diabetic renal disease was an untreatable relentlessly progressive condition.; There is an overwhelming number of studies on genetics and diabetes and also covering the genetics of diabetic complications including nephropathy. However, so far the results are extremely disappointing. Patients at risk cannot be identified and genetic analyses are of no value as a guide to treatment. The notion that the development of complications is controlled mainly by a special genetic pattern is increasingly doubtful. In genetic studies, it is rather phenotypic well-accepted risk factors that dominate. STRUCTURAL BASIS OF MICROALBUMINURIA: Patients with microalbuminuria have significant abnormalities in the kidney, including glomeruli. This is quite clear in patients with type 1 diabetes, but is also seen in type 2 diabetes, where on the other hand, other risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia also seem to be of importance, including loss of autoregulation. Renal biopsies are generally not indicated in the management of diabetic patients. MICROALBUMINURIA AND EARLY MORTALITY: It is quite clear that microalbuminuria predicts early mortality both in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The association to other risk factors may partly explain this--but this does not account for the whole picture. Endothelial dysfunction as well as inflammatory and arteriosclerotic abnormalities in blood vessels may be a relevant hypothesis that needs to be further explored along with other possibilities. CLINICAL COURSE AND ASSOCIATED ABNORMALITIES: The risk factor for progression in normoalbuminuric patients to microalbuminuria is higher than normal albumin excretion (strongest factor), poor glycaemic control, elevated blood pressure, and to some extent smoking. The clinical course of microalbuminuria is usually progressive, but with the more effective intervention now available we encounter that the so-called natural history (without intervention) is increasingly difficult to study. Microalbuminuria is clearly associated with a number of abnormalities, almost in all organs, but GFR is generally well preserved in spite of more advanced structural lesions. Therefore, microalbuminuria is an important marker for more pronounced diabetic vascular disease in general as well as for nephropathy. Regression to normoalbuminuria only rarely occurs during standard unchanged nonintensive treatment. TREATMENT STRATEGIES: The best possible glycaemic control is important in preventing and ameliorating the course of normo- and micro-albuminuria. Another major treatment strategy, especially in microalbuminuric patients, is antihypertensive treatment including inhibition of the renal angiotensin aldosterone system. Numerous new studies are available, both in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, documenting that not only microalbuminuria but also renal and cardiovascular complications in these patient are also far better controlled by early detection and treatment. Therefore, screening for microalbuminuria should be a strategy in all diabetes management followed by effective intervention as outlined in this paper.",5,E

Mediators of the process include abnormal glomerular hemodynamics, hypoxia, proteinuria, hypertension, and several vasoactive substances (ie, cytokines and growth factors). Several predisposing host factors may also contribute to the process. Treatments to delay progression are aimed at treating the primary disease and at strictly controlling the systemic blood pressure and proteinuria. The role of antihypertensive agents, statins, and use of other maneuvers such as protein restriction and novel approaches are also discussed herein.",5,E

Diabetics with congestive heart failure should have good glycemic control, treatment of hypertension and dyslipidemia, and treatment with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta blockers as well as digoxin, if the left ventricular ejection fraction is abnormal. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may have left ventricular failure because of a coexistent cardiac disorder or right ventricular failure from pulmonary hypertension. An acute respiratory tract infection may precipitate right ventricular failure and should be treated. Alveolar hypoxia should be corrected by improving alveolar ventilation through relieving airflow obstruction with bronchodilators and by increasing inspired oxygen concentration. Loop diuretics should be used cautiously. Beta blockers may be given to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and left ventricular failure if bronchospasm is not present. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be used to treat left ventricular failure. Digitalis should not be used in patients with right ventricular failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure. There are controversial data about the negative interaction between aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with arthritis and congestive heart failure needing large doses of aspirin for pain relief may be treated instead with acetaminophen, tramadol, or Percocet if necessary for chronic severe pain.",5,E

Physicians can assess depression by using the SIG E CAPS + mood mnemonic, or any of a number of easily administered and scored self-report inventories. Cognitive-behavior therapy is the preferred psychological treatment. Cognitive-behavior therapy emphasizes the reciprocal interactions among physiology, environmental events, thoughts, and behaviors, and how these may be altered to produce changes in mood and behavior. Pharmacologically, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are recommended, whereas the tricyclic antidepressants are not recommended for depression in congestive heart failure patients.

The natural histories of carotid and coronary atherosclerosis are clearly intertwined. The optimal strategies for treatment of patients who present with carotid artery stenoses and co-existent coronary artery disease (CAD) remain controversial. Minimally invasive screening tests for CAD are often unreliable, and patients presenting with significant extracranial carotid artery stenoses should usually be assumed to harbor some degree of CAD. Numerous studies have confirmed, however, that in contrast to peripheral artery stenoses, hemodynamically significant stenoses of the coronary arteries are not necessarily the index lesions that produce myocardial infarctions (MIs). Although there are some anecdotal reports that myocardial revascularization prior to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) improves the short- and long-term cardiac outcomes of patients after CEA, no prospective, randomized, controlled studies have proven this hypothesis. Numerous adverse cardiac events can occur in the perioperative period including congestive heart failure (CHF), arrhythmias, unstable angina pectoris and both nonfatal and fatal MIs. Of these, only MIs are truly ""hard"" endpoints. The incidence of MI after CEA is much lower than after other commonly performed peripheral arterial operations such as aortic or infrainguinal procedures. The perioperative nonfatal and fatal MI rates after CEA average about 1.0% and 0.4%, respectively. The Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis (CARP) study is currently ongoing in the United States as a multicentered randomized prospective controlled trial sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs. In this study, patients with significant CAD who are undergoing operations for peripheral arterial disease are randomized to myocardial revascularization versus best medical care; however, CEA procedures are excluded from this study because cardiac morbidity is low. Based on the low incidence of adverse cardiac events in CEA patients, it is generally prudent to treat their CAD with best medical care rather than routine prophylactic myocardial revascularization.",5,E

Because the beneficial effect of antihypertensive therapy seems to be linked to the degree of blood pressure reduction, guidelines recommend reducing blood pressure below 140/90mm Hg, with a lower target in patients who are young or who have diabetes mellitus (with or without nephropathy) or non-diabetic nephropathy. Blood pressure reduction can be achieved with several classes of drugs, including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists and calcium channel antagonists. Calcium channel antagonists have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke and major cardiovascular events. However, it is still controversial whether different treatment regimens based on different drug classes can offer advantages beyond similar degrees of blood pressure control in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The International Nifedipine GITS Study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT) was a controlled clinical trial aimed at comparing the efficacy of a long-acting calcium channel antagonist, nifedipine gastrointestinal-transport-system (GITS), versus co-amilozide, a combination of the diuretics hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and amiloride, on morbidity and mortality in high-risk hypertensive patients. Nifedipine GITS and HCTZ/amiloride were equally effective at reducing blood pressure and the risk of primary outcomes (a composite of death from any cardiovascular or cerebrovascular cause, non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure). Results from other studies indicate that there may be greater benefits for stroke and smaller benefits for coronary artery disease with calcium channel antagonist-based regimens than with diuretic or beta-blocker-based regimens. However, there is at present insufficient evidence to recommend a specific drug choice based on patient risk profile. Thus, the choice of antihypertensive drug(s) should be according to efficacy and tolerability. In addition to the reductions in cardiovascular risk, two substudies of INSIGHT showed that nifedipine GITS was able to prevent the progression of intima media thickness in the common carotid artery and slow the progression of coronary calcification. The clinical significance of this effect in the prevention of cardiovascular events still remains to be established.",5,E
12834366,Rate control in atrial fibrillation: choice of treatment and assessment of efficacy.,"Animals; Anti-Arrhythmia Agents; Atrial Fibrillation; Disease Management; Heart Failure; Heart Rate; Humans; Monitoring, Physiologic","Boriani, Giuseppe; Biffi, Mauro; Diemberger, Igor; Martignani, Cristian; Branzi, Angelo","The clinical relevance and high social costs of atrial fibrillation have boosted interest in rate control as a cost-effective alternative to long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm (i.e. rhythm control). Prospective studies show that rate control (coupled with thromboembolic prophylaxis) is a valuable treatment option for all forms of atrial fibrillation. The rationale for rate control is that high ventricular rates, frequently found in atrial fibrillation, lead to haemodynamic impairment, consisting of a variable combination of loss of atrial kick, irregularity in ventricular response and inappropriately rapid ventricular rate, depending on the type of underlying heart disease. Long-term persistence of tachycardia at a high ventricular rate can lead to various degrees of ventricular dysfunction and even to tachycardiomyopathy-related heart failure. Identification of this reversible and often concealed form of left ventricular dysfunction can permit effective management by rate (or rhythm) control. Although acute rate control (to reduce ventricular rate within hours) is still often based on digoxin administration, for patients without left ventricular dysfunction, calcium channel antagonists or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) are generally more appropriate and effective. In chronic atrial fibrillation, long-term rate control (to reduce morbidity/mortality and improve quality of life) must be adapted to patients' individual characteristics to grant control during daily activities, including exercise. According to current guidelines, the clinical target of rate control should be a ventricular rate below 80-90 bpm at rest. However, in many patients, assessment of the appropriateness of different drugs should include exercise testing and 24h-Holter monitoring, for which specific guidelines are needed. In practice, rate control is considered a valid alternative to rhythm control. Recent prospective trials (e.g. the Pharmacological Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation [PIAF] and the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management [AFFIRM] trials) have shown that in selected patients, rate control provides similar benefits, more economically, in terms of quality of life and long-term mortality. The choice of a rate control medication (digoxin, beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists or possibly amiodarone) or a non-pharmacological approach (mainly atrioventricular node ablation coupled with pacing) must currently be based on clinical assessment, which includes assessing the presence of underlying heart disease and haemodynamic impairment. Definite guidelines are required for each different subset of patients. Rate control is particularly tricky in patients with heart failure, for whom non-pharmacological options can also be considered. The preferred pharmacological options are beta-blockers for stabilised heart failure and digoxin for unstabilised forms.",5,E

We enrolled 489 patients, of whom 387 were randomised. Patients were designated hibernators or non-hibernators according to the volume of hibernating myocardium.

Cardiac remodeling plays important roles in the progression of cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction, valvular heart diseases, myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy. In addition to cardiac myocytes, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix proteins and coronary vasculature are also involved in the remodeling process. Cardiac remodeling is associated with alterations of many mediators such as neurohumoral factors, cytokines, enzymes, ion channels, oxidative stress and mechanical stress. Although remodeling is initially an adaptive response to maintain normal cardiac function, it gradually becomes maladaptive and leads to progressive decompensation. Recent research has attempted to elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms of cardiac remodeling and to develop novel therapeutic strategies for heart failure.

Structural and functional abnormalities in coronary circulation as well as extravascular factors (eg, left-ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis with diastolic dysfunction) compromise the adequate ratio of coronary blood flow to oxygen demand causing angina, dyspnea, and major cardiac events. Recent studies stress the importance to functional disturbances of coronary microvasculature leading to profound morphologic changes associated with impaired coronary conductance. In patients without epicardial coronary stenosis hypertensive microvascular disease can be qualitatively assessed by noninvasive diagnostic approaches based on new Doppler echocardiography techniques and may also be monitored by widely available stress tests. For ultimate quantitative assessment, invasive procedures are still required. Beyond guidelines to control blood pressure in hypertensive individuals, restoration of functional and structural integrity of the coronary microvasculature represents the ultimate therapeutic goal in hypertensive patients with coronary insufficiency and without angiographic evidence of atherosclerosis. Concomitant factors reducing coronary conductance such as left-ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction should be reversed in parallel. Currently, therapeutic intervention in the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin-II-system using ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and low doses of aldosterone antagonists represent the most promising strategy to achieve these goals.

There are also attractions in choosing calcium antagonists because of their efficacy in controlling anginal symptoms (Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers if already on a beta-blocking agent and rate-limiting calcium channel blockers if beta blockers are contraindicated). Thiazide diuretics have proven themselves effective again in the ALLHAT study and are likely to be an integral part of treatment for the great majority of patients with coronary artery disease.",5,E

Forty-six million people in the US are experiencing heart failure and 550000 new cases are diagnosed annually. A large percentage of these patients with heart failure have a normal or nearly normal left-ventricular ejection fraction. Isolated diastolic dysfunction may be associated with an increased mortality. One of the major causes of diastolic dysfunction is hypertension. Advances in diagnosis and treatment strategies may improve the clinical outcome for patients with diastolic dysfunction.,5,E

Numerous different classes of drugs are currently used to treat hypertension. The angiotensin receptor blockers offer one of the newest approaches to the management of patients with high blood pressure. Compared with other classes of antihypertensive agents, the angiotensin receptor blockers appear overall to have a low potential for drug interactions, but variations within the class have been detected. Losartan and irbesartan have a greater affinity for cytochrome p450 (CYP) isoenzymes and, thus, are more likely to be implicated in drug interactions. There is pharmacokinetic evidence to suggest that such interactions could have a clinical impact. Candesartan cilexetil, valsartan and eprosartan have variable but generally modest affinity and telmisartan has no affinity for any of the CYP isoenzymes. In vitro studies and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic evaluation can provide evidence for some interactions, but only a relatively small number of drug combinations are usually studied in this way. The absence of any pharmacokinetic evidence of drug interaction, however, should not lead to complacency. Patients should be made aware of possible interactions, especially involving the concurrent use of over-the-counter products, and it may be prudent for all patients receiving antihypertensive treatment to be monitored for possible drug interactions at their regular check-ups. The physician can help by prescribing agents with a low potential for interaction, such as angiotensin receptor blockers.",3,E

Digoxin may be useful for maintaining clinical stability and exercise capacity in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Digoxin appears to be of most benefit in patients with severe heart failure, cardiomegaly and a third heart sound. Digoxin should be used as a second-line drug after diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers in patients with congestive heart failure who are in sinus rhythm. Digoxin should be used as a first-line drug in patients with congestive heart failure who are in atrial fibrillation. ARRHYTHMIAS: Digoxin has a limited, but useful, role, either alone or in combination with other agents such as beta-blockers, diltiazem or verapamil, in achieving satisfactory resting ventricular rate control in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation.

Trials with different drugs and other therapeutic modalities including beta-blockers, intravenous amiodarone and override suppression of automatic atrial foci by atrial pacing have shown partial success as preventive measures. However, a comparison between those three interventions has not been reported.; Thirty-six consecutive patients that underwent CABG at our institution were randomly assigned to atrial pacing (18 patients) and intravenous amiodarone (18 patients) after baseline clinical, electrocardiographic and hemodynamic assessment. All patients received concomitant oral metoprolol or atenolol right after extubation. Thirty-three patients who had CABG at our center in the previous two months and that only received beta-blockers during their perioperative period served as a control group.; The majority of baseline clinical and hemodynamic characteristics were similar in all groups. Only one patient (5.6%) developed AF in the atrial pacing group versus five (27.8%) on amiodarone and six (18.2%) who only received beta-blockers. That finding, however, did not attain statistical significance (p > 0.05). After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds of occurrence of AF was 77% lower in atrial pacing patients (OR = 0.23; 95% CI: 0.02, 2.20; p = 0.09) and 2.36 times higher in those on amiodarone (95% CI: 0.55, 10.24; P = 0.053) when compared to patients which only received beta blockers. Since only one patient on right atrial pacing developed atrial fibrillation, the analysis of the median time to onset and median duration of atrial fibrillation was restricted to those assigned to amiodarone and those who only received beta-blockers showing no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). Although no statistical significance was achieved, the median hospital stay was one-day shorter in the beta-blockers group. Most of the side effects were minor and resolved without sequelae.; This pilot study showed a trend in favor of atrial pacing versus intravenous amiodarone or beta-blockers in the prevention of postoperative AF after CABG in our center. Randomization of a larger patient sample would be required in order to ascertain the true value of the observed trend.",3,E

Individual time points for intraocular pressure were not statistically different between groups except at the 10:00 PM time point, when the mean for TDFC was 14.6 +/- 2.7 mmHg and for latanoprost was 16.6 +/- 3.1 mmHg (P < 0.006). Eighteen patients overall preferred latanoprost versus 2 patients for the fixed combination, generally because of the greater convenience of once daily dosing. Adverse events were not significantly different between groups except that a bitter taste was found more frequently with TDFC (n = 9) than with latanoprost (n = 0; P = 0.009). Despite screening to exclude intolerance to beta-blockers, a single patient had to discontinue the TDFC because of new-onset asthma.; This study indicates that the 24-hour diurnal intraocular pressure is lowered more, by a small but statistically significant amount, with TDFC compared with latanoprost in primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertensive patients.",4,E

Complementing major advances into the understanding of the local, as distinct from the systemic RAS, a number of large clinical trials have examined whether blockade of the RAS might provide protection from the long-term complications of diabetes, beyond that due to blood pressure reduction alone. While some controversy remains, these studies have, in general, suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and more recently, angiotensin receptor blockade reduce the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy, cardiovascular disease and possibly retinopathy.

From these epidemiological observations, the benefits of fatty fish consumption have been explored in cell culture and animal studies, as well as randomized controlled trials investigating the cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids. Dietary omega-3 fatty acids seem to stabilize the myocardium electrically, resulting in reduced susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias, thereby reducing the risk of sudden death. These fatty acids also have potent anti-inflammatory effects, and may also be antithrombotic and anti-atherogenic. Furthermore, the recent GISSI-Prevention study of 11 324 patients showed a marked decrease in risk of sudden cardiac death as well as a reduction in all-cause mortality in the group taking a highly purified form of omega-3 fatty acids, despite the use of other secondary prevention drugs, including beta-blockers and lipid-lowering therapy.

12882875,"Heart failure: the frequent, forgotten, and often fatal complication of diabetes.",Diabetes Complications; Heart Failure; Humans,"Bell, David S H","There is a high frequency of heart failure (HF) accompanied by an increased mortality risk for patients with diabetes. The poor prognosis of these patients has been explained by an underlying diabetic cardiomyopathy exacerbated by hypertension and ischemic heart disease. In these patients, activation of the sympathetic nervous system results in increased myocardial utilization of fatty acids and induction of fetal gene programs, decreasing myocardial function. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system results in myocardial remodeling. It is imperative for physicians to intercede early to stop the progression of HF, yet at least half of patients with left ventricular dysfunction remain undiagnosed and untreated until advanced disease causes disability. This delay is largely because of the asymptomatic nature of early HF, which necessitates more aggressive assessment of HF risk factors and early clinical signs. Utilization of beta-blockade, ACE inhibitors, or possibly angiotensin receptor blockers is essential in preventing remodeling with its associated decline in ventricular function. beta-Blockers not only prevent, but may also reverse, cardiac remodeling. Glycemic control may also play an important role in the therapy of diabetic HF. The adverse metabolic side effects that have been associated with beta-adrenergic inhibitors in the diabetic patient may be circumvented by use of a third-generation beta-blocker. Prophylactic utilization of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers to avoid, rather than await, the need to treat HF should be considered in high-risk diabetic patients.",5,E

Moreover, significantly greater increases from baseline in LVEF were seen with carvedilol than with metoprolol in a double-blind, randomised study and in a meta-analysis. Carvedilol also reversed or attenuated left ventricular remodelling in patients with CHF and in those with left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Combined analysis of studies in the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program (patients had varying severities of CHF; n = 1094) revealed that mortality was significantly lower in carvedilol than in placebo recipients. In addition, the risk of hospitalisation for any cardiovascular cause was significantly lower with carvedilol than with placebo. Mortality was significantly lower with carvedilol than with metoprolol in patients with mild to severe CHF in the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) [n = 3029]. The Carvedilol Prospective Randomised Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) trial (n = 2289) demonstrated that compared with placebo, carvedilol was associated with significant reductions in all-cause mortality and the combined endpoint of death or hospitalisation for any reason in severe CHF. All-cause mortality was reduced in patients who received carvedilol in addition to conventional therapy compared with those who received placebo plus conventional therapy in the Carvedilol Post-Infarct Survival Control in LV Dysfunction (CAPRICORN) trial (enrolling 1959 patients with left ventricular dysfunction following acute MI).

Adverse events associated with the alpha- and beta-blocking effects of the drug occurred more commonly with carvedilol than with placebo, whereas placebo recipients were more likely to experience worsening heart failure. In conclusion, carvedilol blocks beta(1)-, beta(2)- and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors and has a unique pharmacological profile. It is thought that additional properties of carvedilol (e.g. antioxidant and antiproliferative effects) contribute to its beneficial effects in CHF. Carvedilol improves ventricular function and reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with mild to severe CHF, and should be considered a standard treatment option in this setting. Administering carvedilol in addition to conventional therapy reduces mortality and attenuates myocardial remodelling in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following acute MI. Moreover, mortality was significantly lower with carvedilol than with metoprolol in patients with mild to severe CHF, suggesting that carvedilol may be the preferred beta-blocker.",5,E

As a consequence, such agents retard progressive renal dysfunction in adults with chronic proteinuria. Long-term efficacy and tolerability data in children are unavailable.; Efficacy of losartan in reducing proteinuria and in preserving renal function was prospectively assessed in 52 consecutive children under 18 years of age with chronic proteinuric renal disorders, an initial creatinine clearance > or =25 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and a minimum of two or more follow-up visits. Thirty had proteinuria (P), and 22 had proteinuria combined with hypertension (P+H). Adverse effects were also evaluated.; Proteinuria had persisted or increased during a mean interval of 8.5 months before initiation of losartan at a mean dosage of 0.8 mg/kg/d. Mean protein excretion before starting losartan was 2453 mg/m(2)/d and fell by 34% at a mean follow-up time of six weeks (visit I, P<.05), and between 64% and 67% at mean follow-up periods of 0.38, 0.71, and 2.48 years corresponding to visits II, III, and IV (all P<.001 compared with baseline). The proportion of children with protein excretion exceeding 40 mg/m(2)/h (nephrotic range proteinuria) or nephrotic syndrome (>3500 mg/1.73 m(2)/d) fell from 42% and 40% at the start, to 24% and 8%, respectively, at visit IV (P<.01). Mean creatinine clearance as well as serum potassium and total CO(2) levels remained unchanged during the time of follow-up. Reduction in proteinuria in the P subgroup alone correlated with lowering in diastolic blood pressure at visit II and with both diastolic and systolic blood pressure at visits III and IV (all P<.05); it was largely independent of reduction in blood pressure in the P+H subgroup. The concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents in 28 of the 52 children had an influence on proteinuria only at baseline and at visit I (P<.05). There was no significant change in height or body mass index Z scores. Thirteen children had adverse effects potentially ascribed to losartan; most of these either improved or resolved with dosage adjustment or resulted in its discontinuation in 9 of the 52 children (17%).; Losartan therapy was associated with a marked and sustained reduction in proteinuria and in preservation of GFR in children with chronic proteinuric disorders. The association between proteinuria and systemic blood pressure reduction was complex: it was largely limited to the first year of losartan therapy and was more pronounced in the normotensive subgroup. Losartan was generally well tolerated.",3,E

Primary stroke prevention measures applicable to the general public include a healthy diet containing fruits, vegetables, fish, and low fat; exercise; smoking cessation; limiting alcohol to moderate use; and perhaps avoidance of stress. Screening for hypertension, cholesterol, heart disease, and carotid artery stenosiscan lead to even more effective stroke prevention in high-risk patients. Specific antihypertensive drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor blockers may be especially protective against stroke. Secondary stroke prevention in patients who have already had a stroke or transient ischemic attack is even more effective in preventing more serious strokes. Measures include antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering agents, carotid endarterectomy, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation and other cardiac sources of embolic stroke, and antiplatelet therapy.

Twelve principles of migraine management were identified, covering screening, diagnosis, management and treatments: Almost all headaches are benign/primary and can be managed by all practising clinicians. Use questions/a questionnaire to assess the impact on daily living and everyday activities, for diagnostic screening and to aid management decisions. Share migraine management between the clinician and the patient. Provide individualised care for migraine and encourage patients to manage their migraine. Follow up patients, preferably with migraine calendars or diaries. Regularly re-evaluate the success of therapy using specific outcome measures and monitor the use of acute and prophylactic medications regularly. Adapt migraine management to changes that occur in the illness and its presentation over the years. Provide acute medication to all migraine patients and recommend it is taken at the appropriate time, during the attack. Provide rescue medication/symptomatic treatment for when the initial therapy fails. Offer to prescribe prophylactic medications, as well as lifestyle changes, to patients who have four or more migraine attacks per month or who are resistant to acute medications. Consider concurrent co-morbidities in the choice of appropriate prophylactic medication. Work with the patient to achieve comfort with mutually agreed upon treatment and ensure that it is practical for their lifestyle and headache presentation. Using these principles, practising clinicians can screen and diagnose their headache patients effectively and manage their migraine patients over the long-term natural history of the migraine process. In this way, the majority of migraine patients can be well treated in primary care, ensuring a structured and individualised approach to headache management, and conserving valuable healthcare resources.",5,E

12923384,New evidence on the importance of the renin-angiotensin system in the treatment of higher-risk patients with hypertension.,Antihypertensive Agents; Humans; Hypertension; Renin-Angiotensin System; Risk Factors,"Sleight, Peter; Yusuf, Salim","We reviewed the drug treatment of hypertension in the light of recent trials. beta-Blockers and diuretics clearly reduce mortality, strokes, and coronary heart disease (CHD) in hypertension. Recent trials assessed whether newer agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or calcium blockers, offer any additional advantage, or have benefits in high-risk individuals with conventionally 'normal' blood pressure. The recent ALLHAT study claimed no differences in CHD or mortality when chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril were compared. However, the decrease in blood pressure was not the same with the three agents, and a substantial proportion of patients enrolled did not have clinical disease. In contrast, the LIFE study (comparing losartan and a beta-blocker) and the ANBP-2 study [comparing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and a diuretic] reduced blood pressure similarly, yet demonstrated benefits in favour of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors. Other trials indicated similar advantages of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Among high-risk patients with initial blood pressure in the 'normal' range, ACE inhibitors significantly reduce clinical events (mortality, strokes, and myocardial infarction), despite modest decreases in blood pressure, suggesting that additional mechanisms are responsible. Recent results of the Prospective Studies Collaboration show lower risk, even in the normal blood pressure range; high-risk patients will benefit further from ACE inhibitors and ARBs (and beta-blockers after myocardial infarction). Data for other blood pressure decreasing agents are unavailable in such populations. We conclude that blood pressure decreasing per se is of clinical benefit, but drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system offer additional advantages. Drug choice is best determined by the patient's clinical condition.",5,E

Medical literature supports the use of SSRIs for the treatment of many conditions outside of the indications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. SSRIs offer a reasonable alternative to traditional therapy for generalized anxiety disorder. A side effect of SSRIs coincidentally provides therapy for premature ejaculation. SSRIs may reduce the frequency and severity of migraine headaches and are possibly effective in reducing the pain of diabetic neuropathy. When taken in combination with tricyclic antidepressants, SSRis offer more potent therapy for fibromyalgia than either agent alone. SSRIs appear to be effective in some patients with neurocardiogenic syncope that is refractory to standard therapies. Clinical experience supported by ongoing research continues to expand on the broad array of therapeutic applications for this class of medication.",5,E

Fourteen were treated with sotalol; 13 converted to sinus rhythm, of whom 2 relapsed. There was one intrauterine death. Four patients were treated with sotalol and digoxin, of whom two were treated successfully. Mean birth weight was 3,266 g. The daily maternal sotalol dose was linearly related to the maternal plasma concentration. The mean fetal/maternal sotalol plasma concentration was 1.1 (range 0.67 to 2.87, SD 0.63), and the mean amniotic fluid/fetal blood ratio of sotalol was 3.2 (range 1.28 to 5.8, SD 1.4). The effectiveness of sotalol therapy could not be extrapolated from maternal blood levels.; Sotalol is a potent antiarrhythmic agent in the treatment of fetal tachycardia. The placental transfer is excellent. Sotalol accumulates in amniotic fluid but not in the fetus itself. Therefore it seems that renal excretion in the fetus is efficient and greater than the oral absorption by fetal swallowing. The maternal blood level is not a reliable predictor of the chances of success of therapy. Sotalol is not associated with fetal growth restriction.",5,E

Data were combined using a fixed-effect model and expressed as Peto odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and as numbers-needed-to-treat/harm (NNT/H). Twenty-one trials involving 3646 patients were included: 11 trials using beta-blockers (6 drugs; 866 patients), 6 clonidine or mivazerol (614 patients), 3 diltiazem or verapamil (121 patients), and 1 nitroglycerin (45 patients). All trials had an inactive control; there were no direct comparisons. beta-blockers decreased ischemic episodes during surgery (7.6% versus 20.2% with placebo; OR 0.32 [95% CI, 0.17-0.58]; NNT 8) and after surgery (15.2% versus 27.9% with control; OR 0.46 [95% CI, 0.26-0.81]; NNT 8). alpha(2)-agonists decreased ischemia during surgery only (19.4% versus 32.8%; OR 0.47 [95% CI, 0.33-0.68]; NNT 7). beta-blockers reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (0.9% versus 5.2%; OR 0.19 [95% CI, 0.08-0.48]; NNT 23) but only when 2 trials with high-risk patients were included. The effect of alpha(2)-agonists on myocardial infarction was not significant (6.1% versus 7.3%; OR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62-1.14]). beta-blockers significantly decreased the risk of cardiac death from 3.9% to 0.8% (OR 0.25 [95% CI, 0.09-0.73], NNT 32). alpha(2)-agonists significantly decreased the risk of cardiac death from 2.3% to 1.1% (OR 0.50 [95% CI, 0.28-0.91], NNT 83).

There were no significant differences in blood pressure after either therapy. The change from earlier antihypertensive therapy, moxonidine produced significant subjective amelioration of sexual dysfunction in 9/11 of the men (< or = 0.001), whereas 9/11 returned to impaired dysfunction after crossover to metoprolol treatment.

Long-acting calcium antagonists seem to be as effective as thiazide diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in preventing all-cause mortality and stroke in patients with hypertension, but are probably inferior to ACE inhibitors in preventing coronary artery disease. In patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease, calcium antagonists are generally as effective as beta-blockers in relieving angina and improving exercise time-to-onset of angina or ischaemia. Unstable angina or myocardial infarction require treatment with a beta-blocker, with an ACE inhibitor added when necessary for blood pressure control or if there is significant left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. If beta-blockers are contraindicated and if there is no LV dysfunction, a non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist can be substituted.",5,E

Multivariate analysis indicates determinants of blood pressure normalisation after 4 weeks with B2.5 mg/HCTZ 6.25 mg as female gender, initial BP < 175/105 mmHg, previously untreated hypertension, age < 50 years. In conclusion, when the initial therapy with bisoprolol 2.5 mg/HCTZ 6.25 mg is not sufficient to control blood pressure, continuation with the same dosage 4 weeks longer increases the rate of blood pressure control.

In vitro studies have shown that nicardipine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. Since the combination of metoprolol and nicardipine is likely to be used for the treatment of hypertension, we examined the interaction between these two drugs at steady-state. 2 Fourteen healthy volunteers, seven extensive and seven poor metabolisers of dextromethorphan were studied in a double-blind, randomised cross-over four-period protocol. Subjects received nicardipine 50 mg every 12 h, metoprolol 100 mg every 12 h, a combination of both drugs and placebo during 5.5 days. Steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine and metoprolol were analyzed. Beta-adrenoceptor blockade was assessed as the reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia. 3 During treatment with metoprolol, alone or in combination with nicardipine, its steady-state plasma concentrations were higher in subjects of the poor metaboliser phenotype than in extensive metabolisers. Beta-adrenoceptor blockade was also more pronounced in poor metabolisers than in extensive metabolisers of dextromethorphan during treatment with metoprolol alone or in combination with nicardipine (24.0 +/- 2.4% vs 17.1 +/- 3.5% and 24.1 +/- 2.5% vs 15.4 +/- 2.7% reduction in exercise trachycardia, respectively, P < 0.01 in each case). 4 Nicardipine produced a small increase in plasma metoprolol concentration in extensive metabolisers from 35.9 +/- 16.6 to 45.8 +/- 15.4 ng ml(-1) (P < 0.02), but had no significant effect in poor metabolisers. However, nicardipine did not alter the R/S metoprolol ratio in plasma 3 h after dosing, the plasma concentration of S-(-)-metoprolol 3 h after dosing or the beta-adrenoceptor blockade produced by metoprolol in subjects of both phenotypes. The partial metabolic clearance of metoprolol to alpha-hydroxy-metoprolol was not altered significantly in extensive metabolisers. Plasma nicardipine concentration and beta-adrenoceptor blocking effects did not differ between the phenotypes and were not influenced by metoprolol. We conclude that beta-adrenoceptor blockade during repeated dosing with metoprolol is more pronounced in poor than in extensive metaboliser subjects, that nicardipine decreases a CYP2D6-independent route of metoprolol elimination but does not increase beta-adrenoceptor blockade during repeated dosing with metoprolol.",E,E

The greater reduction in cardiac stroke work on amlodipine compared with atenolol warrants further investigation during longer-term studies.",E,E
12964914,Lowering blood pressure in 2003.,Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Hypertension,"Chalmers, John P; Arnolda, Leonard F","The foundation of treatment for patients with hypertension is ongoing use of lifestyle measures such as physical exercise, weight reduction, and salt restriction. There should be emphasis on reduction of total cardiovascular risk, including smoking cessation and achievement of goal blood pressures. There are now five classes of first-line blood-pressure-lowering drugs - diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium antagonists. In most patients, the choice of drug will be guided by the clinical situation in the individual patient, including the presence of target organ damage, diabetes, established vascular or kidney disease, or other comorbidities. In the absence of such clinical indications, start drug therapy with a low-dose diuretic. Combination therapy will be needed in around two-thirds of patients, and a diuretic will normally form one element of most combinations, with the second or third drug coming from among the remaining four. Consider the use of fixed-dose combinations to improve adherence to therapy. Use long-acting, once-daily preparations.",5,E

Fifty were randomized to atenolol 50 mg and 50 to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg+amiloride 5 mg (co-amiloride) once daily. The doses were doubled at 3 or 6 months if diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remained > or = 95 mmHg. If DBP was > or = 95 mmHg even at 6 or 9 months, patients were classified as non-responders, and nifedipine 20 mg b.i.d. was added. After one year 31/50 randomized to atenolol and 17/50 randomized to co-amiloride had responded to monotherapy (p < 0.05). Neither clinical findings nor haemodynamic measurements by Doppler at baseline could distinguish between co-amiloride responders and non-responders. Conversely, non-responders to atenolol as compared with atenolol responders had higher body weight (p = 0.02), higher systolic BP (p = 0.03), higher DBP (p = 0.009), stroke volume (p = 0.04), and cardiac output (p = 0.0002) combined with lower total systemic vascular resistance (p = 0.02). This suggests that some were apparent non-responders due to too low dosing of atenolol rather than true non-responders.

Subjects were classified according to Swedish standard criteria. Ambulatory blood pressure (amb-BP) was recorded in a random sample of normotensives and borderline hypertensives as well as in all the untreated hypertensives identified at screening and willing to participate. A subgroup of borderline hypertensives also carried out self-measurements of blood pressure (self-BP) both at work and at home. The blood pressure lowering efficacy of atenolol 50 mg o.d. and enalapril 20 mg o.d. was compared in hypertensives at rest, during 24 hours, and during dynamic and isometric exercise. The efficacy of enalapril and lisinopril (two ACE inhibitors with different durations of action) were also compared, with special focus on the early morning hours.; Men and women classified as normotensives clearly differed from those with hypertension, also when blood pressure was recorded with ambulatory technique. The number of correctly classified subjects did not differ between self-BP and office-BP; combining the two added little. Atenolol reduced blood pressure better during dynamic exercise than did enalapril, while there was no significant difference in effect between enalapril and lisinopril, not even 18-24 hours post-dose.; More comprehensive blood pressure measurements should be considered in the evaluation of hypertension treatment. Office BP, however, seems a reasonably good tool for diagnosing hypertension.",E,E

Each active treatment period was 6 months long. A euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp test was done to measure insulin sensitivity, and i.v. glucose tolerance was investigated with insulin determinations. Lipoprotein concentrations were quantified and lipoprotein lipase activities were determined in muscle and adipose tissue and in plasma after heparin injection. The blood pressure was significantly reduced by both regimes. The insulin sensitivity index was decreased by 34% during propranolol treatment and by 17% during pindolol treatment. The insulin concentrations in plasma were elevated at the end of the i.v. glucose tolerance test but were not high enough to compensate for the insulin resistance, so HbA1c and glucose concentrations were increased. A significant reduction of lipoprotein lipase activity in skeletal muscle during propranolol treatment probably explains the pronounced increase in serum triglyceride concentration during propranolol treatment despite lower free fatty acids and higher lipoprotein lipase activity in adipose tissue. These changes of lipoprotein lipase activity were not correlated to the changes in insulin sensitivity. In summary, the metabolic effects were significantly less pronounced with pindolol than with propranolol, which probably can be ascribed to the agonistic effect of pindolol on beta 2 adrenoceptors.",E,E

The enzyme seems to be particularly abundant in the heart. Recently, the Arg528-encoding allele of the ALAP gene was shown to be associated with essential hypertension.; We evaluated the influence of this polymorphism on the change in left ventricular mass index in 90 patients with essential hypertension and echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy, randomised in a double-blind study to receive treatment with either the angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist irbesartan or the beta1-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol for 48 weeks. Genyotyping was performed using minisequencing.; After adjustment for potential covariates (blood pressure and left ventricular mass index at baseline, blood pressure change, age, sex, dose and added antihypertensive treatment), there was a marked difference between the Arg/Arg and Lys/Arg genotypes in patients treated with irbesartan; those with the Arg/Arg genotype responded on average with an almost two-fold greater regression of left ventricular mass index than patients with the Lys/Arg genotype (-30.1 g/m2 [3.6] vs -16.7 [4.5], p = 0.03).; The ALAP genotype seems to determine the degree of regression of left ventricular hypertrophy during antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist irbesartan in patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.

We report the initial US experience with cyanoacrylate in this prospective trial and evaluate its safety, efficacy, and relative costs.; Patients with active or recent gastric variceal bleeding were eligible. Cyanoacrylate therapy was performed until variceal occlusion was achieved. Rebleeding was assessed at 72 h (acute phase), 6 wk (subacute phase), and 1 yr (chronic phase). Survival was assessed at 3 months and 1 yr. Cost analysis was performed comparing the first 17 patients to historical control patients not treated with cyanoacrylate.; A total of 44 patients were enrolled, 37 with cirrhosis and seven with noncirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH). In cirrhotic patients, rebleeding was seen in two of 37 (5%) at 72 h, one of 30 (3%) at 6 wk, and five of 28 (18%) at 1 yr. Survival without shunt at 3 months was 30 of 34 (88%) and at 1 yr was 24 of 31 (77%). In NCPH patients, rebleeding was seen in two of seven (29%) at 72 h. These patients received definitive therapy for NCPH after diagnosis. Mortality and costs were substantially higher in the non-cyanoacrylate group. The odds of death were greater by 7-fold in the non-cyanoacrylate group than within the cyanoacrylate group (95% CI = 1.18-41.36, p = 0.0318). At 3 months, there was a 3.18-fold difference (95% CI = 1.05-9.64, p = 0.0411) in accrued costs; at 1 yr, the difference was 2.55-fold (95% CI = 0.96-6.94, p = 0.0585). The cost-effective ratio was estimated as 108,237 US dollars/death averted, reflecting marked cost reduction with improved survival in the cyanoacrylate-treated group.

This review is aimed to (1) summarize indications for OAC in patients with AF, (2) give an overview of the current knowledge of risk factors for bleeding complications of OAC and (3) give practical recommendations for an optimal OAC therapy in the neurological setting. Indications for OAC are increased age (>75 years), arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, previous thromboembolism, heart failure and, probably, coronary heart disease. Risk factors for bleeding complications are overanticoagulation with international normalized ratios (INRs) >3.0, increased age, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, previous thromboembolism, polypharmacy, the early phase of OAC therapy and a lack of patients' education. Before initiation of OAC, the patient should be screened for potential bleeding sites. Careful monitoring of OAC comprises fixed appointments for the INR value determination, tracking for the patient, if he does not attend, advices about pain therapy, information about the influence of diet on the INR value and drug interaction, unscheduled INR determination in case of acute disorders and regular assessment if OAC is still indicated. Monitoring of OAC needs an effort, which has to be adequately estimated by the health care system.",5,E

These drugs have traditionally been considered contraindicated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of this study was to assess the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers on respiratory function of patients with COPD. Comprehensive searches were performed of the EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases from 1966 to May 2001, and identified articles and related reviews were scanned. Randomised, blinded, controlled trials that studied the effects of cardioselective beta-blockers on the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) or symptoms in patients with COPD were included in the analysis. Interventions studied were the administration of beta-blocker, given either as a single dose or for longer duration, and the use of beta2-agonist given after the study drug. Outcomes measured were the change in FEV1 from baseline and the number of patients with respiratory symptoms. Eleven studies of single-dose treatment and 8 of continued treatment were included. Cardioselective beta-blockers produced no significant change in FEV1 or respiratory symptoms compared to placebo, given as a single dose (-2.05% [95% CI, -6.05% to 1.96%]) or for longer duration (-2.55% [CI, -5.94% to 0.84]), and did not significantly affect the FEV1 treatment response to beta2-agonists. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant change in results for those participants with severe chronic airways obstruction or for those with a reversible obstructive component. In conclusion, cardioselective beta-blockers given to patients with COPD do not produce a significant reduction in airway function or increase the incidence of COPD exacerbations. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and hypertension, cardioselective beta-blockers should be considered for patients with COPD.",4,E

Although ACE inhibitors remain first-line drugs in the treatment of heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction, clinical evidence suggests that a newer class of agents--angiotensin II receptor blockers--may provide additional benefit by blocking the adverse effects of angiotensin II more completely. An improved adverse-effect profile also makes angiotensin II receptor blockers appropriate in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. Clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers on the combined endpoints of morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. Aldosterone antagonism with spironolactone has additive benefits in patients receiving an ACE inhibitor. The most recent treatment guidelines for heart failure recommend the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers and spironolactone in selected patients.",5,E

Major advances in the treatment of MI have since occurred. However, patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) were excluded from those trials. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of beta-blockers in post-MI patients with CHF receiving contemporary management.; This was a prespecified subgroup analysis of a double-blind, randomized trial: the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure (MERIT-HF). Patients with CHF in New York Heart Association class II to IV with an ejection fraction (EF) < or =0.40 and a history of being hospitalized for an acute MI (n = 1926) were randomized to metoprolol succinate controlled release/extended release (CR/XL) versus placebo. Mean EF was 0.28, and the mean follow-up was 1 year.; Metoprolol CR/XL reduced total mortality by 40% (95% CI 0.20-0.55, P =.0004), and sudden death by 50% (95% CI 0.26-0.66, P =.0004).

Both open-label and double-blind placebo-controlled studies using fixed-site, ""follow the pain."" or a combination approach have demonstrated significant reduction in migraine frequency, severity, and duration, as well as decreased use of acute medications. The most prominent reductions have been noted in those with reportedly the most severe migraine headaches.

It is common for CV disease to be either the primary or secondary problem for elderly patients receiving critical care. The therapeutic options for CV problems experienced in the critical care setting range from medical management with the goal of symptom relief and comfort care to invasive therapies such as PCI, intraaortic balloon pump therapy, invasive monitoring, and cardiac surgery. Age alone is not a contraindication for any of the invasive therapies. Instead, a careful risk-benefit analysis should be performed for each individual patient, taking into consideration physiologic age, comorbid conditions, other disabilities, and an assessment of quality of life. Additionally, the goals (symptom relief, improvement of quality of life, survival benefit) of any therapy should be clearly established for individual patients. End-of-life issues, cardiovascular surgery, and the disabling of ICDs deserve special consideration in the elderly, as these are often challenging issues that will likely be more frequently encountered in critical care settings as science and technology advance.",5,E

Cardiomyocytes express all three beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes-beta1, beta2, and, at least in some species, beta3. The beta1 subtype is the most prominent one and is mainly responsible for positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of catecholamines. The beta2 subtype also increases cardiac function, but its ability to activate nonclassical signaling pathways suggests a function distinct from the beta1 subtype. In heart failure, the sympathetic system is activated, cardiac beta-receptor number and function are decreased, and downstream mechanisms are altered. However, in spite of a wealth of data, we still do not know whether and to what extent these alterations are adaptive/protective or detrimental, or both. Clinically, beta-adrenergic antagonists represent the most important advance in heart failure therapy, but it is still debated whether they act by blocking or by resensitizing the beta-adrenergic receptor system. Newer experimental therapeutic strategies aim at the receptor desensitization machinery and at downstream signaling steps.",5,E

Interventions in staff-model health maintenance organizations were more effective than those conducted in group-model health maintenance organizations.; High-quality studies of interventions to improve drug use in MCOs are increasing in frequency.

The cerebroprotective effect does not seem to be shared by other drug classes, such as the beta-blockers or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in patients without manifest cardiovascular disease.

Trandolapril was also recommended for patients with heart failure, diabetes, or renal impairment.; Primary: first occurrence of death (all cause), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke; other: cardiovascular death, angina, adverse experiences, hospitalizations, and blood pressure control at 24 months.; At 24 months, in the CAS group, 6391 patients (81.5%) were taking verapamil sustained release; 4934 (62.9%) were taking trandolapril; and 3430 (43.7%) were taking hydrochlorothiazide. In the NCAS group, 6083 patients (77.5%) were taking atenolol; 4733 (60.3%) were taking hydrochlorothiazide; and 4113 (52.4%) were taking trandolapril. After a follow-up of 61 835 patient-years (mean, 2.7 years per patient), 2269 patients had a primary outcome event with no statistically significant difference between treatment strategies (9.93% in CAS and 10.17% in NCAS; relative risk [RR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-1.06). Two-year blood pressure control was similar between groups. The JNC VI blood pressure goals were achieved by 65.0% (systolic) and 88.5% (diastolic) of CAS and 64.0% (systolic) and 88.1% (diastolic) of NCAS patients. A total of 71.7% of CAS and 70.7% of NCAS patients achieved a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg.; The verapamil-trandolapril-based strategy was as clinically effective as the atenolol-hydrochlorothiazide-based strategy in hypertensive CAD patients.",3,E

The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.",5,E

Strength of evidence was assessed.; Recent clinical trial results showed that most patients with atrial fibrillation have similar outcomes with strategies for controlling ventricular rate compared with strategies for restoring sinus rhythm. For efficacy of primary stroke prevention, compared with placebo, evidence was strong for warfarin and suggestive for aspirin. The evidence for an increased risk for major bleeding was suggestive for warfarin and inconclusive for aspirin. For ventricular rate control, verapamil, diltiazem, atenolol, and metoprolol were qualitatively superior to digoxin and placebo, particularly during exercise. For efficacy of acute conversion, compared with placebo, evidence was strong for ibutilide, flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, amiodarone, and quinidine. For efficacy of maintenance of sinus rhythm after conversion from atrial fibrillation, evidence was strong for amiodarone, propafenone, disopyramide, and sotalol. Echocardiography was found to be useful in estimating risk for thromboembolism and potentially useful in estimating likelihood of successful cardioversion and maintenance.; For several key questions in the pharmacologic management of atrial fibrillation, strong evidence exists to support 1 or more treatment options.",5,E

Repeated-measures analysis of covariance showed that level of baseline DBP (p < 0.0001), time of follow-up (p < 0.0001), and propranolol use (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with a decrease in DBP at 12 months.

The subjects assigned to take propranolol more frequently reported fatigue during ordinary activities, sleep disturbance, decrease in sexual activity, and depressed feelings, when compared with the subjects taking placebo, but the numbers of study withdrawals did not differ by drug assignment. No significant difference in total cholesterol and glucose levels was observed by group assignment. Triglycerides increased significantly in the subjects assigned to propranolol (mean difference = +20 mg/dL; 95% CI of difference +1.5, +39). There was no difference in the responses to 21 quality of life items between the subjects assigned to propranolol and those assigned to placebo.; This multicomponent lifestyle modification intervention was unable to promote persistent behavior changes and thus was inferior to propranolol therapy for the treatment for mild diastolic hypertension.

Insulin sensitivity was assessed by a modified insulin suppression test. Blood pressure (BP), insulin sensitivity, and serum lipoprotein concentrations were compared before and after each treatment and between the two treated groups. BP decreased significantly and comparably during enalapril and atenolol treatment (p < or = 0.01). The sensitivity to insulin improved by 15% (p = 0.03) in the enalapril group and worsened by 17% (p < or = 0.01) in the atenolol group. Serum lipoprotein concentrations were not modified by any treatment. The improvement in insulin sensitivity caused by enalapril treatment appears to be an advantage as compared with atenolol treatment in hypertensive obese and dyslipidemic patients, whereas the BP-lowering efficacy of the two drugs is similar.

In studies using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, lacidipine 2 to 8mg administered once daily in the morning reduced blood pressure over 24 hours, with the reductions being greater during the day than at night in some studies. 77 to 87% of patients with mild to moderate hypertension had their blood pressure controlled by treatment with lacidipine 2 to 8 mg/day for 1 to 4 months in dose-finding studies. When administered once daily, lacidipine 4 to 6 mg was equivalent in antihypertensive efficacy to hydrochlorothiazide 25 to 50 mg/day, atenolol 50 to 100 mg/day, and the prototype calcium channel blocker nifedipine 20 to 40 mg twice daily (sustained-release formulation). The adverse effects of lacidipine are those common to other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and include headache, flushing, ankle oedema, dizziness and palpitations. The long term effects of lacidipine on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and possible additional clinical benefits in terms of its antiatherosclerotic effects, are under investigation; the outcome of these studies will be important in defining the future role of this agent in the treatment of hypertension. Thus, available evidence suggests lacidipine provides a further alternative to the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers currently available for the treatment of essential hypertension.",E,E

A guide to selection.,"Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Animals; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Heart Failure; Humans; Hypertension; Myocardial Infarction; Receptors, Adrenergic","Hampton, J R","beta-Blockers have been in clinical use for 30 years, and have an accepted role in (among others) the treatment of high blood pressure, the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction and the treatment of arrhythmias. Their place in the treatment of heart failure is currently under investigation. The drugs available in the 1970s and early 1980s were subjected to intense investigation. A new generation of beta-blockers, including some such as carvedilol and bucindolol, with vasodilating properties, is now appearing. As yet these later agents have not been the subject of large clinical trials. Clinical practice involves the treatment of individual patients with defined dosages of particular drugs. It is, therefore, not acceptable to base practice on theories derived from the clinical pharmacology of a particular drug, on the results of small trials or on a meta-analysis of results from a number of trials that were individually inadequate. Clinical practice must follow the results of large-scale trials in defined populations. The major trials in hypertension, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias and heart failure provide the best evidence for the use of individual beta-blockers in each of these clinical situations. In patients with high blood pressure, beta-blockers do not seem to have any particular advantage over other hypotensive agents. In myocardial infarction, relatively late use of a beta-blocker undoubtedly reduces fatality, though the value of early treatment is less clear. beta-Blockers are not powerful antiarrhythmics, but they do appear to prevent sudden death. Their possible role in heart failure is perhaps the most interesting current field of beta-blocker research. There are very few comparative studies of beta-blockers, and it is difficult to make precise recommendations. None of the new generation of beta-blockers has yet been used in a trial that is large enough trial for any of them to be accepted for routine use in preference to older drugs. The use of individual beta-blockers, as with any drug, should follow the results of clinical trials. Propranolol and atenolol have been studied most intensely in hypertension. For secondary prevention of myocardial infarction, the evidence is best for timolol. Sotalol is probably the best antiarrhythmic among the beta-blockers. Whether any individual beta-blocker is best for heart failure remains to be seen.",E,E

In most instances, the presence of these arrhythmias is associated with an increased risk of future arrhythmic events. Electrophysiologic studies are helpful in risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease but can be misleading in the setting of dilated cardiomyopathy and often produce nonspecific results in patients with HCM. The need for an invasive electrophysiologic study is crucial in the diagnosis of certain ventricular arrhythmias that are amenable to cure with radiofrequency catheter ablation, such as idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and BBR-VT. The correct approach for patients with SVT not amenable to catheter ablation remains to be determined. In deciding whether to use a device or drug therapy, however, one should take into consideration the degree of left ventricular dysfunction and the overall health status of the patient. For example, device implantation clearly reduces sudden death in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction but may not change total mortality because these same patients may die of congestive heart failure. Device therapy might be more cost-effective for patients with less severe depression of left ventricular function.",E,E

Eighteen patients taking metoprolol and 22 taking xamoterol withdrew from the study during one year, with a low mortality, reinfarction rate, and progress of heart failure in both treatment groups. Mean dose from baseline to 3 months was 135 mg metoprolol and 347 mg xamoterol.; beta 1 Receptor antagonists with or without partial agonist activity are safe to use in mild to moderate heart failure after a myocardial infarction. Exercise tolerance, quality of life, and clinical signs and functional class of heart failure improve, and few patients show deterioration in their condition. Exercise tolerance is no better with xamoterol than metoprolol.",I,E

A second objective was to compare the tolerability and the safety of these treatments. Timolol in Gelrite is a new topical formulation of timolol in an anionic heteropolysaccharide gellan gum. A total of 156 patients entered the study after an appropriate wash-out. The medication schedule included one drop of test drug in each eye at 9 a.m. (active drug for both groups) and 9 p.m. (placebo for the TG group, active drug for the TS group). At trough, the mean decrease from baseline intraocular pressure (after appropriate wash-out) ranged from 5.7 to 6.3 mmHg for the TG group and from 5.9 to 6.2 mmHg for the TS group. The difference between the treatment group means ranged from -0.4 to 0.4 mmHg. At peak, the mean decrease from baseline IOP ranged from 5.3 to 6.2 mmHg for TG group and from 5.1 to 6.1 mmHg for the TS group. The difference between the treatment group means ranged from -0.7 to 0.4 mmHg. The results of this study support the hypothesis of a comparable hypotensive effect at peak and trough of 0.25% timolol in Gelrite q.d. to 0.25% timolol solution b.i.d. Furthermore, timolol in Gelrite has an acceptable tolerability profile. The incidence of blurred vision was higher in the Gelrite group, but this different was not statistically significant.

Its role in preventing very early rebleeding (within days) following sclerotherapy needs to be established. The best candidates for such a role are somatostatin and octreotide, but glypressin and vasopressin and nitroglycerin combinations have therapeutic effects in the short-term. Propranolol is the drug for long-term prevention of rebleeding and prevention of the first variceal bleed. For primary prophylaxis it significantly reduces the rate of bleeding, and there is a trend towards reducing mortality. It should be used in cirrhotic patients with large varices. For secondary prophylaxis, propranolol significantly reduces rebleeding but does not improve survival. The reduction in rebleeding is similar to long-term sclerotherapy when compared in randomized studies. There is no value in adding beta-blockers to sclerotherapy compared with sclerotherapy alone, but few studies have evaluated the effects after the eradication of varices. beta-Blockers can be used as the first-line therapy to prevent variceal rebleeding. They also have been shown to reduce the frequency of rebleeding from congestive gastropathy. Many patients do not have a portal pressure reduction with propranolol. The addition of isosorbide mononitrate converts many nonresponders to responders. Current clinical trials are evaluating if therapeutic efficacy is improved by these drug combinations.",I,E

One group received propofol/alfentanil (Group Prop; n = 14) and the other isoflurane/alfentanil (Group Iso; n = 13). Periods of haemodynamic instability were correlated to episodes of myocardial ischaemia as assessed by Holter monitoring (begun the evening before surgery and ceasing the morning of the first postoperative day). In Group Prop, anaesthesia was induced with alfentanil 30 micrograms.kg-1 i.v., propofol up to 1.5 mg.kg-1 and vecuronium 0.15 mg.kg-1, and maintained with infusions of propofol at 3-12 mg.kg-1.hr-1 and alfentanil at 30 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1. In Group Iso, anaesthesia was induced with alfentanil and vecuronium as above, thiopentone up to 4 mg.kg-1 and maintained with isoflurane and alfentanil infusion. Phenylephrine was infused to support MAP at 110 +/- 10% of ward values during cross-clamp of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in both groups. Emergence hypertension and/or tachycardia was treated with labetalol, diazoxide or propranolol. Myocardial ischaemia was defined as ST-segment depression of > or = 1 mm (60 msec past the J-point) persisting for > or = one minute. For the entire anaesthetic course (induction to post-emergence), there was no difference between groups for either duration or magnitude outside the < 80 or > 120% range for HR or MAP. However, when the period of emergence from anaesthesia (reversal of neuromuscular blockade to post-extubation) was assessed, more patients were hypertensive (P = 0.004) and required vasodilator therapy in Group Iso (10/13 vs 5/14; P = 0.038 Fisher's Exact Test). The mean dose of labetalol was greater in Group Iso (P = 0.035). No patient demonstrated myocardial ischaemia during ICA cross-clamp. On emergence, 6/13 patients in Group Iso demonstrated myocardial ischaemia compared with 1/14 in Group Prop (P = 0.029). Therefore, supporting the blood pressure with phenylephrine, during the period of ICA cross-clamping, appears to be safe as we did not observe any myocardial ischaemia at this time. During emergence from anaesthesia, haemodynamic instability was associated with myocardial ischaemia. Under these specific experimental conditions, with emergence, hypertension and myocardial ischaemia were more prevalent with more frequent pharmacological interventions in patients receiving isoflurane.",E,E

All patients had a history of unstable angina combined with typical ECG changes and without evidence of a previous, recent, or ongoing myocardial infarction. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the relationship between the patency of the culprit artery and the behavior of the ischemia-related regional left ventricular (LV) wall motion.; On entry to the study, all patients received conventional drug therapy: i.v. nitroglycerin therapy, an oral beta-blocking agent, and a calcium antagonist. Baseline angiography was carried out within 3 h after randomization, a mean of 4.2 +/- 3.0 h (range, 1 to 17 h) after the last attack of chest pain. Treatment with trial medication was withheld in 33 cases. Sixty-five patients with coronary artery disease received anistreplase (30 U/5 min)/heparin and 61 patients heparin-only therapy. Angiography was repeated 20.6 +/- 4.6 h (mean +/- SD; range, 12 to 39 h) after the baseline angiographic study. To assess changes in regional myocardial wall motion, the LV wall was divided into seven segments. The ischemia-related coronary artery stenosis was calculated quantitatively and related to the quantitatively assessed mean regional left ventricular ejection fraction (RLVEF) of the ischemia-related segments. In 118 of 126 patients who received trial medication, we found that anistreplase/heparin therapy leads to a significantly (p < 0.01) greater reduction in coronary artery diameter stenosis than heparin-only therapy (n = 63, mean +/- SD, 11 +/- 22, vs n = 55, mean +/- SD, 3 +/- 11%). Anistreplase/heparin therapy was related to a larger significant improvement of the ischemia-related RLVEF than heparin-only therapy, although the latter association was not statistically significant (n = 63, mean +/- SD, 7 +/- 15, vs n = 55, mean +/- SD, 5 +/- 14%). The effects of change of coronary artery stenosis on regional LV wall motion were also determined. A paradoxical finding was that a persistently occluded vessel or a vessel showing an increase in coronary artery stenosis was associated with a greater improvement of the ischemia-related RLVEF than a reopened vessel or a vessel with a reduction in coronary artery stenosis (n = 15, mean +/- SD, 7 +/- 11, vs n = 41, mean +/- SD, 8 +/- 13, vs n = 15, mean +/- SD, 1 +/- 12, vs n = 47, mean +/- SD, 5 +/- 16%, NS). One day after the last attack of chest pain, the regional LV wall motion was still abnormal in about 20% of patients.; In these patients with unstable angina, the LV wall motion improved both in the treated and the control group at follow-up angiography 1 day later. Improved coronary arterial anatomy was associated with a lesser improvement of the LV contractile function than when worsening of the coronary angiographic appearance occurred. There is no rational explanation of these results. This is a beginning of an effort to elucidate the clinical significance of the stunned and hibernating myocardium in humans.",E,E

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of continuous blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors with prazosin on hemodynamics, liver function, and renal function and whether the association of propranolol or furosemide enhances the portal pressure lowering effect of prazosin.; Cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension were studied at baseline and after a 3-month course of prazosin (n = 18) or placebo (n = 10).; No changes were observed in the placebo group. Prazosin decreased the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) while increasing hepatic blood flow. Liver function improved as shown by an increase in hepatic and intrinsic hepatic clearances of indocyanine green and galactose elimination capacity. A significant reduction in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance was associated with increases in plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate. The plasma volume increased significantly, and 6 patients developed edema. The association of propranolol (n = 8) but not furosemide (n = 7) to prazosin increased the reduction in HVPG and attenuated the increase in plasma renin activity.; In cirrhotic patients, continuous prazosin administration reduces portal pressure and improves liver perfusion and function but favors sodium and water retention.

T/P ratios were calculated by three different methods: directly from the curves that averaged all individual 24 h profiles (A); averaging all individual T/P ratios after ABPM data were averaged for each patient over either 1 h intervals (B) or 3 h intervals (C). Methods B and C produced different values of T/P which, for each drug, were significantly higher with method C. With method A, nifedipine appeared to have the higher T/P. With methods B and C (which in contrast to method A, permitted statistical comparisons), differences between nifedipine and the other drugs were not significant. Meanwhile, method B appears to adhere most closely to FDA guidelines by taking more into account the interindividual variability of BP profile. Thus, we suggest that precise guidelines for measuring T/P on the basis of ABPM are needed, whereas for the comparison between drugs, both the mean value of the T/P and its variance must be determined.",E,E

At baseline, the total duration of myocardial ischemia was 11.4 +/- 13.9 minutes (mean +/- SD per 24 hours), and the total number of episodes was 2.2 +/- 2.3. Metoprolol significantly reduced the total duration of ischemia by -8.7 minutes (95% CI -14.5 to -2.8) and the total number of episodes by -1.9 (-2.9 to -0.8) in patients with a low SD of normal-to-normal intervals at baseline (SDNN), using the median value of 50 ms as a cut-off value. In contrast, significant treatment effects were not observed in patients with a high SDNN at baseline. Similar results were obtained using baseline total power or low-frequency power, but not when using baseline heart rate. Diltiazem reduced the total duration of ischemia by -4.9 minutes (-9.7 to -0.1), but not the number of episodes. Moreover, in contrast to metoprolol, efficacy of diltiazem was not related to baseline HR variability.

Stroke survivors, categorized by residual deficit and disability, assessed their quality of life with a time trade-off technique. Multivariable regression identified patient characteristics associated with intracranial hemorrhage. Over-all, 1.4% of the patients had a stroke (93% anatomic documentation). The risk ranged from 1.19% with streptokinase/subcutaneous heparin therapy to 1.64% with combination thrombolytic therapy (P = .007). Primary intracranial hemorrhage rates ranged from 0.46% with streptokinase/subcutaneous heparin to 0.88% with combination therapy (P < .001).

Angiotensin II, noradrenaline and ANP were elevated in the early phase but tended to normalize during the first week in patients without signs of heart failure. In patients with heart failure angiotensin II and noradrenaline remained elevated for 1 month and ANP for 4-6 months. During head-up tilt, angiotensin II and noradrenaline increased most in patients with heart failure. In patients with a first myocardial infarction there was a positive correlation between sustained neurohormonal activity and infarct size. Almost complete suppression of plasma ACE activity was achieved within 30 min in 48 patients treated with intravenous enalaprilat, initiated within 24 h from the onset of infarction. The drug was tolerated in dosages of 1.0-1.2 mg given over 1-2h. Patients with systolic blood pressure between 100 and 110 mmHg incurred a greater risk of hypotension than those with higher blood pressure at baseline. Tolerance was not worse among patients treated with intravenous diuretics, metoprolol or nitroglycerin.

In patients with diabetic nephropathy, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to be more effective in this regard than conventional antihypertensive therapy. Whether this applies to the much larger population of patients with essential hypertension is not yet known. In the present study, the effects of two different antihypertensive therapies on the loss of GFR with time, determined with Cr51-EDTA clearance after 6, 12 and 24 months of treatment, were assessed in a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial in 257 patients with essential hypertension. All had normal renal function and none had diabetes mellitus or glucosuria. Proteinuria (dipstick positive or trace) was detected in 7 patients initially. The two therapeutic modalities were the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent atenolol. Both therapies were equally effective in lowering systolic blood pressure (e.g. from 168 mmHg to 152 mmHg with cilazapril and from 170 mmHg to 155 mmHg with atenolol after 6 months, p < 0.001 for both). However, atenolol was slightly but significantly more effective in lowering the diastolic blood pressure at 6, 12 and 24 months. The decline in GFR with time was significantly smaller with cilazapril than with atenolol. After 6 months the reduction in GFR was 1.0 vs. 4.0 ml/min x 1.73 m2, p = 0.008 (cilazapril vs. atenolol) and after 12 months the corresponding changes were 2.0 vs. 4.5 ml/min x 1.73 m2, p = 0.04 and after 24 months 3.0 vs. 4.0 ml/min x 1.73 m2, respectively (n.s.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

After a 2- to 3-week run-in phase on open-label low-dose carvedilol, patients were randomized to continued treatment with carvedilol (up to 25 mg BID) or to matching placebo. After 6 months, left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide ventriculography had increased by 5.2% (2P < .0001) in the carvedilol group compared with the placebo group, and left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions measured by two-dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiography had decreased by 2.6 mm (2P = .0005) and 1.3 mm (2P = .05), respectively. There were no significant changes in either treadmill exercise duration or 6-minute walk distance between carvedilol and placebo groups (both 2P > .1); in the carvedilol group, exercise performance was therefore maintained with a 23% lower rate-pressure product. Symptoms assessed by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) scale and the Specific Activity Scale (SAS) were unchanged in two thirds of patients in both groups, but there was a small excess of patients whose symptoms worsened and a deficit of patients whose symptoms improved among those assigned carvedilol (NYHA, 2P = .05; SAS, 2P = .02).; In patients with heart failure of ischemic etiology, 6-month treatment with carvedilol improved left ventricular function and maintained exercise performance at a lower rate-pressure product, but symptoms assessed by functional class were slightly worsened.

A preliminary review of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of hypertension.,Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Enalapril; Humans; Hypertension,"Noble, S; Sorkin, E M","Spirapril is a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prodrug which is converted to the active metabolite spiraprilat following oral administration, and which has been evaluated primarily for the treatment of hypertension. In dose-finding studies of patients with mild to severe hypertension, spirapril > or = 6 mg once daily produced reductions in blood pressure of approximately 10 to 18 mm Hg (systolic) and 7 to 13 mm Hg (diastolic) [24-hour postdose trough readings at the end of the treatment period]. Blood pressure normalisation (trough diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) had occurred in 29 to 50% of patients at the end of these investigations. The dose-response curve for spirapril appears to be flat for doses of 6 to 24 mg once daily. Comparisons with other ACE inhibitors are limited in number, and further studies are required before the relative antihypertensive efficacy of spirapril can be fully evaluated. However, in single, well controlled clinical trials, spirapril produced similar reductions in blood pressure to those seen with enalapril or captopril. When given as monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, spirapril may offer potential advantages over the calcium antagonist nitrendipine. Spirapril is generally well tolerated and produces an adverse event profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Data from small studies suggest that spirapril can be used without dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment, as a consequence of its dual renal and hepatic clearance mechanisms. This is in contrast to most ACE inhibitors, which are eliminated by a predominantly renal mechanism that results in accumulation of the active metabolite when renal function is impaired. However, the utility of spirapril in this patient group has yet to be fully determined because of conflicting data regarding its effects on renal function. Thus, spirapril is an effective antihypertensive agent which is well tolerated. Further comparative trials are needed to fully determine its efficacy with respect to other ACE inhibitors, and a better understanding of its effects on renal function will clarify its role in hypertensive patients with renal failure.",E,E

Total peripheral resistance was unchanged with metoprolol (-1.7%) but decreased with celiprolol (-11.2%), a significant difference between the two treatments (P = 0.01). Left ventricular mass index was reduced by 5.7% in those patients receiving metoprolol and by 11.8% in those receiving celiprolol (P < 0.001). Cardiac index fell significantly with metoprolol and marginally with celiprolol (-13.9% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.003). Left ventricular diastolic function-as shown by the transmitral early to late peak filling velocity ratio-was not altered with metoprolol, but a significant increase (17%, P = 0.2) was seen with celiprolol. Both metoprolol and celiprolol increased aortic root distensibility, with celiprolol having a significantly greater effect (80% vs. 30%, P < 0.01). We conclude that, in comparison to metoprolol, long term antihypertensive therapy with celiprolol improves left ventricular diastolic and aortic root function, whilst reducing total peripheral resistance and left ventricular hypertrophy.",E,E

We have recently compared the effects of the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril and of the beta blocker atenolol on the structure and the function of subcutaneous resistance arteries of essential hypertensive patients. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either cilazapril or atenolol for a period of 2 years. The blood pressure was normalized for the duration of the trial by both drugs. The media-to-lumen ratio of resistance arteries, which was significantly increased in all hypertensive patients before starting treatment, was normalized by the 2-year treatment with cilazapril, whereas treatment with atenolol did not result in any change in this vascular parameter. Treatment with cilazapril also returned to normal the contractile responses to several vasoconstrictors, particularly endothelin 1. Endothelium-dependent relaxation responses of blood vessels to acetylcholine were abnormal in hypertensive patients and improved in the cilazapril-treated patients, but remained unchanged in the atenolol-treated ones. We conclude that treatment with the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril corrects in part the vascular remodeling and the functional abnormalities of resistance arteries of hypertensive patients, whereas treatment with the beta blocker atenolol does not. These results may indicate that treatment with cilazapril and perhaps with other angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitors as well may improve the clinical outcome in hypertension by inducing a regression of abnormal resistance vessel structure and function.",E,E

This has been most extensively studied in patients with diabetic nephropathy and, to some extent, with other forms of renal disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to be more effective in this regard than conventional antihypertensive therapy. This important aspect of antihypertensive treatment has not been studied previously in patients with essential hypertension. Preliminary results regarding the effects of two different antihypertensive therapies on the loss of GFR with time, determined with 51Cr-EDTA clearance after 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment, are presented here. The GFR was assessed in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial in 257 patients with essential hypertension. All had a normal renal function, and none had diabetes mellitus or glucosuria. The two therapeutic modalities were the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent atenolol. Both therapies were equally effective in lowering the systolic blood pressure. However, atenolol was slightly but significantly more effective in lowering the diastolic blood pressure after 6, 12, and 24 months. The decline in GFR with time was significantly smaller with cilazapril than with atenolol. After 6 months, the reduction in GFR was 1.0 (cilazapril) vs. 4.0 (atenolol) ml/min x 1.73 m2 (p < 0.01). After 12 months the corresponding changes were 2.0 vs. 4.5 ml/min x 1.73 m2 (p < 0.05) and after 24 months 3.0 vs. 4.0 ml/min x 1.73 m2 (n.s.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

After a control period, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA; propranolol, metoprolol or arotinolol) was administered for three months. Thereafter, the patients were randomised to receive a beta-adrenoceptor blocker with ISA (pindolol or carteolol) for three months or a beta-adrenoceptor blocker without ISA for a further three months. This pattern was continued until all beta-adrenoceptor blockers had been given. At the end of each period, CPK and CPK-MB levels were measured.

No complaints were made by subjects treated with propranolol and arotinolol, but muscle cramps were reported in 2 treated with metoprolol. While muscle cramps were caused both by pindolol and carteolol in 16 subjects, they were caused by either of these drugs in the remainder of the subjects. Muscle cramp occurred mainly in the calves when the patients were in bed at night.

Based on different statistical analysis procedures (including time series analysis) a responder and nonresponder evaluation for cyclandelate and propranolol was performed. In addition, an attempt was made to identify the dose relationship of the various drugs on headache parameters. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study 84 patients were treated in a placebo run-in phase (4 weeks). The patients were then randomized by the statistical criterion of placebo responder and nonresponder to either the cyclandelate or the propranolol group. The total treatment period included a low-dosage phase (8 weeks) and high-dosage phase (8 weeks). All patients kept a headache diary before, during and after treatment. The data were assessed by time series analysis (ARIMA), as well as by analysis of variance and nonparametric statistics. Based on ARIMA statistics, 39.3% of the patients showed a significant improvement of migraine during treatment with cyclandelate compared with 29.4% placed on propranolol. Higher doses of cyclandelate and propranolol were more effective. Using the qualitative response-criterion of a 50% reduction in migraine symptoms, cyclandelate showed a response in 67.9% and propranolol in 41.2% of all cases.

Short-term studies were done during cardiac catheterization in young normotensive subjects (mean age, 33 years; range, 19 to 40) and several different age-matched (range, 25 to 53 years) groups of patients with essential hypertension. Aortic impedance, resistance, wave reflections, and compliance were calculated from high-fidelity recordings of ascending aortic pressure and flow signals during baseline and after nitroprusside, propranolol followed by phentolamine, phentolamine, captopril, and nifedipine, respectively, at doses sufficient to normalize blood pressure in each hypertensive group. Propranolol exacerbated all the hemodynamic parameters; these effects were only partially overcome by phentolamine. Among the other agents only phentolamine did not completely normalize compliance, and only captopril did not completely normalize wave reflections. The long-term study was a randomized, double-blind comparison of fosinopril and atenolol in 79 normotensive subjects and 79 essential hypertensive patients. Baseline 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures and carotid artery tonometry to index wave reflections were performed in all subjects and in hypertensive patients after 8 weeks of therapy. Both fosinopril and atenolol normalized blood pressure and lowered the elevated augmentation index, but fosinopril had a significantly larger effect than atenolol. Both short- and long-term beta-blockade did not have as beneficial an effect as the other agents. Thus, the differing hemodynamic effects of the various classes of antihypertensive agents might be a consideration in the choice of therapy.",E,E

Of 410 men in whom initial treatment failed, 352 qualified for randomization to the alternate drug.; Of the 352 patients, 173 (49.1%) achieved their goal diastolic blood pressure, in 133 (37.8%) the alternate drug failed, and 46 (13.1%) left the study for various reasons. Overall response rates were as follows: diltiazem, 63%; clonidine, 59%; prazosin, 47%; hydrochlorothiazide, 46%; atenolol, 41%; and captopril, 37%. The best response rate for patients in whom hydrochlorothiazide failed was achieved with diltiazem (70%); after atenolol failure, clonidine (86%); after captopril failure, prazosin (54%); after clonidine failure, diltiazem (100%); after diltiazem failure, captopril (67%); and after prazosin failure, clonidine (53%). The combined response rate for patients initially randomized to an active treatment was 76.0%, which is similar to that achieved by the combination of two drugs in previous studies.; We conclude that sequential single-drug therapy is a rational approach for treatment of hypertension in patients in whom initial drug therapy has failed.",E,E

Thirty-nine untreated essential hypertensive patients and 28 normotensive control subjects were studied in basal conditions. Hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: bisoprolol (10 mg/day, n = 15), enalapril (20 mg/day, n = 12), and verapamil SR (240 mg/day, n = 12), and were studied before and after 1 month of treatment. Plasma catecholamines were determined by a radioenzymatic assay. Surface beta 2-adrenoceptors were measured in intact lymphocytes by radioligand binding assay using the hydrophilic ligand [3H]-CGP12177. beta 2-adrenoceptor density was increased in hypertensive patients (P < .01). After treatment, mean blood pressure decreased similarly in the three groups, while plasma catecholamines showed no significant changes in any group. beta 2-adrenoceptor number decreased only in bisoprolol-treated patients (P < .05). Mean blood pressure decreases correlated with beta 2-adrenoceptor decrements only in bisoprolol-treated patients (r = 0.65, P < .05). beta 2-adrenoceptor density correlated with plasma epinephrine levels in the control group (r = -0.50, P < .01), but not in hypertensive patients before treatment. This correlation was also observed in hypertensive patients treated with bisoprolol (r = -0.52, P < .05), but not in those treated with verapamil or enalapril.

In the present report 53 patients with angiographic coronary artery disease but uncompromised left ventricular function and with electrocardiographically documented recurrent angina pectoris in spite of bed rest, aspirin, and repeated sublingual administration of nitroglycerin were studied. They were randomized for treatment with equipotent doses of either the nonselective beta blocker propranolol (80 mg/day) or the selective beta blocker with beta-2-agonistic property, celiprolol (200 mg/day) during one week. Angina frequency was higher in the propranolol group (P < 0.01), whereas myocardial oxygen demand as estimated by the double product (DP = SBP x HR, systolic blood pressure x heart rate) was equally reduced by the two beta blockers. Forearm blood flow was essentially higher in the celiprolol group (P < 0.001). A stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the beneficial effects of the beta blockers were largely dependent on their effect on peripheral flow, in addition to reduction of the double product. The authors conclude that (1) Both celiprolol and propranolol largely reduce angina pectoris frequency in unstable angina pectoris. (2) Celiprolol contributes to nearly complete relief in three times as many patients as propranolol; after adjustment for double product or for systolic blood pressure plus heart rate it performs even eight times better. (3) The similar effects of the two compounds on the double product and the essentially different effects on peripheral flow support the conclusion that celiprolol exerts its beneficial effect to a large extent through its vasodilator property.",I,E

Subcutaneous small arteries obtained from gluteal fat biopsies were studied on a wire myograph before treatment and at 1 and 2 years of treatment. Blood pressure was mildly elevated in both groups of patients (mean, 150/100 mm Hg) and was well controlled throughout the 2 years of treatment (mean, 130/85 mm Hg). We previously reported, in arteries from patients treated with cilazapril, an improvement at 1 year of treatment of the vasoconstrictor effect of endothelin-1, which had been significantly attenuated in the untreated hypertensive patients compared with normotensive subjects. After 2 years of treatment, this normalization of endothelin-1 response was still present in small arteries of patients treated with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, whereas in patients treated with atenolol, responses were still unchanged after 2 years of treatment. Endothelial function was tested by examining the response of norepinephrine-precontracted arteries to acetylcholine. Untreated hypertensive patients exhibited a slightly but significantly blunted vasorelaxation in response to 10 mumol/L acetylcholine compared with normotensive subjects. After 1 and 2 years of effective antihypertensive treatment, cilazapril-treated patients exhibited responses to acetylcholine that were not different from those of normotensive subjects, whereas atenolol-treated patients still had impaired responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

We performed a clinical trial comparing the efficacy of the longacting beta-blocker bisoprolol once daily and the short acting nitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, three times daily in the reduction of anginal complaints in daily life and under stress. Thirty patients were enrolled in a double-blind randomised cross-over study. Both bisoprolol and isosorbide dinitrate were effective in reducing anginal attacks and nitroglycerin consumption significantly, but bisoprolol was significantly more effective than isosorbide dinitrate. Bisoprolol improved the workload during bicycle exercise testing significantly, but the improvement with isosorbide dinitrate was not significant. Despite the reduction in maximal rate pressure product, bisoprolol was significantly (P < 0.05) more effective at improving total workload and reducing the time to onset of angina than isosorbide dinitrate. The rate pressure product did not change significantly with isosorbide dinitrate. In this study, bisoprolol 10 mg once daily was more effective and caused less side effects than isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg three times a day. It seems questionable if monotherapy of isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg t.i.d is an adequate drug regime for stable angina pectoris.",I,E

However, it is not known whether these dosages are used in current clinical practice.; In a retrospective analysis of clinical data from 606 consecutive survivors of myocardial infarction at four university hospitals in three countries, we assessed the number of infarct survivors receiving prospectively defined ""effective dosages"" of beta-blockers. We defined these dosages as those that demonstrated improved survival rates of infarct survivors who received active drug in large, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.; Only 58% of infarct survivors with no contraindications to beta-blockers received these drugs at the time of hospital discharge, and only 11% received dosages equivalent to > 50% of the effective dosages. Independent predictors of failure to prescribe beta-blockers to infarct survivors without contraindications to these drugs were the use of diuretic agents, transient heart failure, impaired left ventricular function and increased patient age. Among patients receiving beta-blockers, only the use of propranolol predicted prescription of a low beta-blocker dosage.; Failure to prescribe beta-blockers after myocardial infarction is common but in most cases is not due to clear contraindications. Many patients not receiving beta-blockers belong to subgroups that would derive the greatest benefit from such treatment. Finally, even when beta-blockers are prescribed, the dosages used are considerably lower than those proved to be effective in preventing death after myocardial infarction.",E,E

Buflomedil induced an increase of the same order of magnitude in plasma levels of adenosine and adenine nucleotides. Maximal adenosine increase (84%) was observed at the end of the infusion period, whereas peak plasma levels of ATP and ADP (69 and 55%, respectively) and of AMP (61%) were detected 10 and 5 min after discontinuation of infusion, respectively. Although the exact mode of action of buflomedil at the molecular level remains unclear, some indirect findings suggest that the increase in adenosine may be due to enhanced release rather than to inhibition of cell uptake. Because such activity of buflomedil consists of enhancement of physiologic mechanisms of vasodilation and tissue protection occurring in the course of ischemic events, new pharmacologic perspectives for the drug may arise.",I,8

Those initially receiving isradipine then received atenolol and vice versa. After each therapy regimen, blood was drawn at rest and 1 h after exercise during a maximum exercise test. Platelet activity in vivo was estimated as release of B-TG and PF-4. Fibrinolytic activity was estimated as the fast-acting inhibitor against tissue plasminogen activator usually termed PAI-1. During atenolol and isradipine therapy, blood pressure (BP) was equally reduced (p < 0.05). Heart rate (HR) decreased during atenolol treatment but was not changed by isradipine. Platelet activity in vivo estimated as B-TG and PF-4 decreased irrespective of therapy (p < 0.02). During atenolol, as during placebo therapy, exercise resulted in a significant increase in platelet activity, as shown by an increase in B-TG (p < 0.02) and in PF-4 (p < 0.01). Such increase was not observed during isradipine treatment. Both treatments tended to improve fibrinolysis, as shown by a decrease in PAI, 1 h after exercise.

Heparin has an important adjunctive role in enhancing early vessel patency in patients who receive tissue-type plasminogen activator and in decreasing the frequency of reocclusion of an infarct-related artery during any thrombolytic therapy. Heparin must also be administered to all patients who undergo primary angioplasty. Intravenously administered nitroglycerin and orally administered nitrates are probably most effective in patients with symptomatic ischemia. Calcium channel blockers and prophylactic antiarrhythmic agents are not indicated for most patients with acute myocardial infarction. Currently, insufficient evidence is available to recommend the widespread use of intravenously administered magnesium sulfate in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. In patients with ischemic pain, judicious intravenous administration of morphine can provide relief. Use of warfarin sodium should be reserved for patients at risk for left ventricular mural thrombus.

If blood pressure was controlled, the drug was continued for another 2 weeks. A washout period of at least 2 weeks was allowed between drugs. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced significantly with all of the six drugs. In 18 of the 19 patients, blood pressure was controlled with at least one of six drugs, frequently with the lowest dose.

The patients (35-69 years of age) were included if they were without antihypertensive drugs and after six months of nonpharmacological treatment had supine DBPs between 90 and 104 mmHg; 220 patients were randomised to enalapril (20 or 40 mg/day) and 218 to atenolol (50 or 100 mg/day). After 12 months of treatment, atenolol significantly increased the glucose concentrations at 60, 90 and 120 minutes after an oral intake of 75 g glucose (P < 0.01), while enalapril did not. Atenolol significantly increased fasting blood glucose and insulin concentration 120 minutes after glucose intake, while enalapril did not. Plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides increased significantly in patients having atenolol but not in those having enalapril. HDL cholesterol decreased significantly in the atenolol group but not in the enalapril group. The proportions of patients with clinical adverse experiences were similar in both treatment groups. These results indicate that enalapril does not influence either glucose tolerance or lipoprotein metabolism while atenolol does. These findings are consistent over the 12 month treatment period and confirm earlier short-term study results.",E,E

Patients were randomized to receive either cilazapril 2.5-5 mg or atenolol 25-100 mg per day per day. Blood pressure before treatment was 147/99 and 148/99 mmHg in both groups respectively. At 1 year of treatment blood pressure was 132/86 and 131/85 mmHg in both groups of patients respectively. Treatment for one year with cilazapril resulted in a reduction in the media/lumen ratio of resistance arteries (150-400 microns lumen diameter) dissected from subcutaneous gluteal biopsies from 7.5 +/- 0.3% before treatment to 6.3 +/- 0.2% 1 year later (p < 0.05), still slightly but significantly larger (p < 0.05) than the media/lumen ratio of resistance arteries of normotensive controls (5.1 +/- 0.3%). In arteries from patients treated with atenolol there was no significant change with treatment (8.0 +/- 0.6% before and 8.1 +/- 0.5% after 1 year of treatment). Active wall tension responses to endothelin-1 were blunted in hypertensive patients and normalized in the cilazapril-treated patients, but were unchanged in those taking atenolol. Relaxation in response to acetylcholine of norepinephrine pre-contracted arteries was still significantly reduced after one year (< 0.05) in comparison to those of normotensive patients in the patients treated with atenolol, whereas they were not in those who had received cilazapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1,E

Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents.,"Adult; Age Factors; Antihypertensive Agents; Blood Pressure; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; United States; Veterans","Materson, B J; Reda, D J; Cushman, W C","The antihypertensive efficacy of six drugs and placebo was compared in 1292 men with untreated diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 109 mm Hg. The primary end point ""success"" was defined as the patient having achieved a diastolic blood pressure of < 90 mm Hg at the end of the drug titration period and having maintained a diastolic blood pressure of < 95 mm Hg for 1 year without drug intolerance. The original published success rate data (N Engl J Med 1993;328:914-921) were discovered to be in error due to a computer programming code omission (N Engl J Med 1994;330:1689). This paper presents corrected graphic figures. The corrected success rates were generally higher than originally published. Overall, diltiazem (72%) was significantly higher than hydrochlorothiazide (55%), prazosin (54%), captopril (50%), and placebo (31%); clonidine (62%) and atenolol (60%) were intermediate. There were some changes in the hierarchy of drug response, but important differences in success rates according to age by race subgroups remained. Whites responded well to all drug classes, except for lower efficacy of hydrochlorothiazide in younger whites. Blacks responded better to diltiazem than other agents. In addition, we have analyzed the data using a definition of success based on < 90 mm Hg for 1 year. Use of the <90 mm Hg criterion reduced the rate of success, but had only a minor effect on the drug success rate hierarchy. We conclude that single-drug antihypertensive therapy is effective in a majority of stage 1 to 2 diastolic hypertensive patients, although there are important age-by-race differences in success rates among various drug classes.",E,E

However, little information is available on how this first evaluation may be used to select the best pharmacologic approach in individual patients.; In this prospective multicenter study, 280 patients with stable angina pectoris were enrolled in 25 European centers. After baseline evaluation, consisting of an exercise test and a questionnaire investigating patients' anginal symptoms, the patients were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment for 6 weeks with either metoprolol (Controlled Release, 200 mg once daily) or nifedipine (Retard, 20 mg twice daily) according to a parallel group design. At the end of this period, exercise tests were repeated 1 to 4 h after drug intake.; Both metoprolol and nifedipine prolonged exercise tolerance over baseline levels; the improvement was greater in the patients receiving metoprolol (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that low exercise tolerance was the only variable associated with a more favorable effect within each treatment group. Metoprolol was more effective than nifedipine in patients with a lower exercise tolerance or with a higher rate-pressure product at rest and at ischemic threshold. None of the characteristics of anginal symptoms or exercise test results predicted a greater efficacy of nifedipine over metoprolol.; The results of a baseline exercise test, but not the characteristics of anginal symptoms, may offer useful information for selecting medical treatment in stable angina pectoris.",I,E

An updated review of its therapeutic use in essential hypertension and heart failure.,"Aging; Diabetes Complications; Female; Heart Failure; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypertension; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; Kallikrein-Kinin System; Kidney; Male; Myocardial Infarction; Ramipril; Vascular Resistance","Frampton, J E; Peters, D H","Ramipril is a second generation angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Like enalapril, it is a prodrug and is hydrolysed in vivo to release the active metabolite, ramiprilat, which has a long elimination half-life, permitting once-daily administration. The antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril has been confirmed in large-scale noncomparative studies conducted in general practice as well as in more rigorously controlled clinical trials. In the former, approximately 85% of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension have responded successfully to treatment with ramipril 2.5 or 5 mg/day, while comparative trials indicate that the antihypertensive efficacy of the drug is equivalent to that of other established ACE inhibitors and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol. As expected, the response rate to ramipril monotherapy is lower in patients with severe hypertension (around 40%), although the blood pressure lowering effect can be enhanced with the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide or piretanide. The antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril is maintained in patients with diabetes mellitus and preliminary data indicate that the drug has the beneficial effect of decreasing urinary albumin excretion in diabetic patients with nephropathy. Ramipril is superior to atenolol in causing regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, although the clinical significance of this effect per se remains to be established. The large-scale Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) study demonstrated that ramipril 5 or 10 mg/day significantly decreased the risk of all-cause mortality by 27% in patients with clinical evidence of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction, even if transient. The beneficial effect of ramipril was apparent by 30 days of treatment and appeared to be greatest in patients with more severe ventricular damage after infarction. Ramipril is well tolerated in general practice, with 5% or fewer patients discontinuing therapy because of drug intolerance. The data available suggest that ramipril shares a similar tolerability profile to that of other established ACE inhibitors. Thus, clinical data confirm ramipril as a useful alternative ACE inhibitor for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension, and indicate a beneficial effect of the drug in patients with clinical evidence of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. It is also reasonable to assume that ramipril will be of value in the treatment of patients with more established heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.",E,E

The control group received nifedipine only. Repeated assessments of serum enzyme levels and 12-lead-ECG together with a 3-channel Holter monitoring over 48h were used to classify perioperative myocardial ischemia and supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. The two groups did not differ with respect to their demographic data, extracorporeal circulation, aortic cross-clamping time, or number of distal anastomosis. No perioperative myocardial infarction in either group was detected. However, a significantly lower incidence of transient ischemic event was observed in the NM group as compared transient ischemic events was observed in the NM group as compared to the N group. In addition, there was a tendency towards lower CK-MB-level and peak-values of CK- and CK-MB-enzymes in the NM group. With regard to perioperative dysrhythmias, there was a significantly lower incidence of sinus tachycardia and atrial flutter/fibrillation in the NM group as compared to the N group. In addition, postoperative heart rate was lower in the NM group starting from the 6th hour after opening the aortic cross-clamp. In conclusion, the combined perioperative infusion of nifedipine and metoprolol is superior in preventing perioperative myocardial ischemia and decreasing the incidence of supraventricular arrhythmias as compared to a single-drug regimen with nifedipine.",E,E

To date there have been few attempts to quantitate the impact of such differences. Twenty five unmedicated patients with primary hypertension were randomised to initial therapy with either the calcium antagonist, felodipine, or a diuretic and doses titrated to achieve similar levels of blood pressure (BP). Second drugs were added if needed (metoprolol and prazosin, respectively). The aim was to determine over 1 year whether similar anti-hypertensive effects were associated with differences in a multivariate index of overall cardiovascular risk. The target supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (85 mm Hg) required the second agent in four of 13 evaluable patients in the felodipine group and six of 10 in the diuretic group. There was a significant rise in serum cholesterol and a fall in serum potassium in the diuretic group, but not in the felodipine group. Cardiovascular risk scores were ranked in percentiles in relation to the age-matched general population. This score fell to a greater degree in felodipine patients particularly over the first 6 months, but remaining lower at 12 months. Left ventricular hypertrophy assessed by echocardiography, another measure of cardiovascular risk, was generally unchanged by either regimen. At equivalent blood pressure levels, the calcium antagonist-based regimen had a greater benefit on cardiovascular risk, particularly in the first 6 months of therapy. This method may be widely applicable in the assessment of anti-hypertensive therapy.",E,E

Degree of improvement in systolic function (22 patients) was defined by the change in left ventricular ejection fraction after 3 months of therapy. Degree of improvement in diastolic function (15 patients) was defined as the change in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and change in the slope of the isovolumetric relaxation rate-end-systolic pressure relation.; Both systolic blood pressure at baseline (r = 0.54, p = 0.009) and the maximal positive value of the first derivative of left ventricular pressure with respect to time (peak +dP/dt) at baseline (r = 0.39, p = 0.07) correlated with improvement in ejection fraction after metoprolol treatment. Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that only peak systolic pressure was an independent predictor of systolic improvement. Baseline heart rate, ventricular volumes, ejection fraction and adrenergic activation, as reflected by coronary sinus norepinephrine, did not predict response. Patients with the most diastolic impairment at baseline had the most favorable diastolic improvement. Those with the lowest myocardial respiratory quotient (most fatty acid utilization) at baseline also had the most marked reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.; These data suggest that those patients with the highest peak systolic pressure, highest left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and most prolonged isovolumetric relaxation at baseline will respond best to therapy with metoprolol.

Placebo administration had no effects. Propranolol caused significant reductions (P < .0001) in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG; from 19.1 +/- 4.1 to 16.2 +/- 4.2 mm Hg), azygos blood flow (from 563 +/- 204 to 387 +/- 176 mL/min), cardiac index (CI; from 4.4 +/- 1.0 to 3.3 +/- 0.8 L/m2/min), and FBF (from 237 +/- 79 to 176 +/- 58 mL/m2/min). In 17 patients HVPG decreased below 12 mm Hg and/or more than 20% of the baseline value (good response; mean change, -26 +/- 8%); in the remaining 27 patients (poor response) the mean change in HVPG was less: -9 +/- 6%. Patients with a good response had bled less often from varices, had significantly higher FBF (272 +/- 73 vs. 215 +/- 76 mL/m2/min) and lower baseline HVPG (16.8 +/- 3.9 vs. 20.6 +/- 3.6 mm Hg) than those with poor response in HVPG.

A (patho)physiological relevance for beta 2-receptor-mediated responses has so far not been demonstrated, in part because beta 1-receptor-mediated responses to cardiac neuronally released norepinephrine can mask beta 2-receptor-mediated responses.; In the present study, we evaluated the blood pressure and heart rate responses to bicycle exercise in cardiac transplant patients (n = 7) compared with patients with essential hypertension (n = 8) on placebo and two doses of the beta 1-selective beta-blocker atenolol (25 and 50 mg/d) and the nonselective beta-blocker nadolol (20 and 40 mg/d), each dose for 1 week using a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Exercise was performed 3 hours after dosing, using a stepwise increase in load until exhaustion. Exercise performance was less in the transplant patients and significantly further (25%) decreased by nadolol. Exercise caused equivalent increases in plasma norepinephrine in the two groups, but more marked increases in plasma epinephrine in the transplant patients despite less exercise. In the essential hypertension patients, systolic blood pressure increased by 80 mm Hg on placebo and 60 mm Hg on either blocker. The increase in heart rate (by about 75 beats per minute) was inhibited by 10% and 20% by the lower and higher doses, respectively, similar for the two blockers. In contrast, in the transplant patients, systolic blood pressure increased by 60 mm Hg on placebo, but this increase was totally blocked by either blocker. The heart rate increase (by 50 beats per minute on placebo) was blunted (dose related) by either blocker but 50% more by nadolol versus atenolol.; The present study shows that cardiac beta 2-receptors contribute to a clear extent to the heart rate responses to endogenous circulating catecholamines in the absence of cardiac neuronally released norepinephrine. Nonselective beta-blockade probably is less well tolerated in cardiac transplant patients compared with beta 1-selective blockade.",E,E

To identify factors that could contribute to this curious finding, we analyzed data from the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI-4) trial, in which 382 patients with acute myocardial infarction were randomized to tissue plasminogen activator, anistreplase, or both. Coronary angiography was performed 90 minutes and 18 to 36 hours after randomization, a myocardial perfusion scan was performed at 18 to 36 hours and before discharge, and a radionuclide ventriculogram was obtained before discharge. Angiographic and clinical outcome variables were determined in current smokers, ex-smokers, and nonsmokers, and regression analysis was used to correct for differences in baseline characteristics. The in-hospital mortality of current smokers was lower than that of ex-smokers and nonsmokers: 2.3% versus 5.2% versus 7.0%, respectively (p = 0.04 by paired comparison, current vs nonsmokers). Ninety minutes after randomization, the incidence of TIMI grade 3 flow was significantly higher in smokers than in ex-smokers and nonsmokers (55% vs 43% and 45%, p = 0.02); this difference was no longer observed at the second angiogram, nor did smokers differ from nonsmokers with respect to residual stenosis, thrombus grade, infarct size, ejection fraction, or recurrent ischemia. Because a strong inverse relation exists between TIMI grade 3 flow at 90 minutes and mortality, our findings suggest that the lower mortality of current smokers after thrombolytic therapy may be related to a higher incidence of early, complete reperfusion.",E,E

Subjects performed a maximal treadmill test and a timed 2-mile run before and after each drug treatment. Cardiac output was determined by acetylene rebreathing at rest and at 30%, 50%, and 75% of maximal oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption was determined at the above-mentioned workloads and at maximal effort. Both drugs were titrated to produce similar reductions in blood pressure and the final doses of atenolol and doxazosin were 43 +/- 22 and 6 +/- 6 mg, respectively. Atenolol reduced cardiac output (p < 0.05) and heart rate (p < 0.001) at rest and at all exercise intensities compared with the prior placebo phase, whereas doxazosin increased cardiac output at rest and at 50% effort (p < 0.05). Consequently, cardiac output was higher (p < 0.01) with doxazosin than with atenolol at rest and at 30% and 50% effort. Heart rate was higher with doxazosin (p < 0.01) during all exercise workloads. Despite these changes in cardiovascular function, there were no significant differences between the effect of the 2 study drugs on maximal oxygen consumption or 2-mile run times. We conclude that atenolol decreases rest and exercise heart rate and cardiac output compared with doxazosin, but that at modest doses neither drug adversely affects exercise performance in male hypertensive runners.",E,E

Beta-blocking drugs increase spontaneous heart rate variability in healthy subjects and in patients with coronary heart disease, but little is known about their effects on baroreflex sensitivity and heart-rate based tests of autonomic integrity. In a randomly allocated double-blind crossover study with three 2-week treatment periods, metoprolol CR 200 mg once a day, or atenolol 100 mg once a day, or placebo once a day, were administered to 18 male patients with stable coronary artery disease. Baroreflex sensitivity was determined from the natural baroreflex challenge of Valsalva strain. Heart rate reactions to standard stimuli were measured. No significant differences were found between the effects of atenolol and metoprolol. Beta-blockade did not significantly affect the baroreflex sensitivity, but it diminished the Valsalva ratio significantly (P < 0.001). The difference between maximum and minimum heart rate during hyperventilation was also significantly lower during beta-blockade. The heart rate response to standing up and the ratio of maximum to minimum heart rate during deep breathing were not influenced by beta-blockade. Discontinuation of beta-blockade seems to be unnecessary for reliable determination of baroreflex sensitivity in patients with coronary artery disease, when the natural pressure challenge of Valsalva strain is sued.

As a consequence of this methodological limitation, no data exist on the effects of long-term antihypertensive therapy on global arterial impedance properties and indexes of myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). Using recently validated noninvasive techniques, we compared in hypertensive patients the effects of chronic oral treatment with ramipril, nifedipine, and atenolol on arterial impedance and mechanical power dissipation as well as indexes of MVO2.; Sixteen African-American subjects with systemic hypertension were studied with a randomized, double-blind, crossover protocol. Instantaneous central aortic pressure and flow, from which arterial load characteristics can be derived, were estimated from calibrated subclavian pulse tracings (SPTs) and continuous-wave aortic Doppler velocity in conjunction with two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic measurements of the aortic annulus, respectively. To derive ventricular wall stress and indexes of MVO2, left ventricular short- (M-mode) and long-axis (2D echo) images were acquired simultaneously with SPTs. Data were collected at the end of a 2-week washout period (predrug control) and after 6 weeks of treatment with each agent. Although all three agents reduced diastolic blood pressure to the same extent, different effects on mean and systolic pressures and vascular impedance properties were noted. Nifedipine reduced total peripheral resistance (TPR; 1744 +/- 398 versus 1290 +/- 215 dyne-s/cm5) and increased arterial compliance (ACL; 1.234 +/- 0.253 versus 1.776 +/- 0.415 mL/mm Hg). This improvement in arterial compliance was not entirely accounted for by the reduction in distending pressure. Ramipril also decreased TPR (1740 +/- 292 versus 1437 +/- 290 dyne-s/cm5) and increased ACL (1.214 +/- 0.190 versus 1.569 +/- 0.424 mL/mm Hg), but with this agent, the change in arterial compliance was explained solely on the basis of a reduction in distending pressure. Atenolol, in contrast, did not affect either TPR or ACL. In agreement with the compliance results, nifedipine and ramipril significantly lowered the first two harmonics of the impedance spectrum, but atenolol did not. None of these agents resulted in a significant change in characteristic impedance or in the relative amplitude of the reflected pressure wave. Total vascular mechanical power and percent of oscillatory power remained unaltered with all antihypertensive treatments. Only ramipril and nifedipine reduced the integral of both meridional and circumferential systolic wall stresses, indicating that MVO2 per beat was reduced with these agents. Stress-time index, a measure of MVO2 per unit time, decreased significantly with ramipril but not with nifedipine because of an increase in heart rate noted in 10 of 16 patients (mean increase, 10 beats per minute). Thus, a reduction in MVO2 coupled with unchanged total vascular mechanical power suggests improved efficiency of ventriculoarterial coupling with ramipril and with nifedipine in the subset of patients in whom heart rate remained unchanged. In contrast, there was no evidence of a reduction in wall stress, stress integral, or stress-time index with atenolol.; The noninvasive methodology used in this study constitutes a new tool for serial and simultaneous evaluation of arterial hemodynamics and left ventricular energetics in systemic hypertension. In this study, we demonstrate the differential effects of chronic antihypertensive therapies on systemic arterial circulation and indexes of MVO2 in African-American subjects. Consideration of drug-induced differential responses of arterial load and indexes of MVO2 with each drug may provide a more physiological approach to the treatment of systemic hypertension in indivi",E,E

We report the efficacy, side-effects of treatment, biochemical responses and incidence of hypoglycaemia in 755 patients (mean age 57 years, blood pressure 150/94 mmHg) followed for 2 years.

Blood pressure reduction, adherence to therapy, incidence of side-effects and of hypoglycaemia were similar on captopril and on atenolol. Patients on atenolol had a greater increase in body weight (+2.3 vs +0.7 kg, p < 0.01) and a non-significant trend to a greater increase in triglyceride than patients on captopril. A large blood pressure difference between the tight control and less tight control groups was obtained, with captopril and atenolol having similar hypotensive effects.

Age did not predict the blood pressure response to any agent.; The low level of the correlation between the blood pressure changes with the three drugs suggests that different mechanisms may be involved in the aetiology of essential hypertension. Plasma renin concentration and the initial level of systolic blood pressure contribute only weakly to the identification of responders to the three drugs.",E,E

In 30 male patients with heart failure, we retrospectively analyzed hemodynamic data from 2 protocols examining the effects of a nonselective beta antagonist bucindolol (n = 15), and a highly selective beta 1 antagonist metoprolol (n = 15). Both studies were conducted in a similar fashion with patients undergoing cardiac catheterization before and after receiving 3 months of beta blockade. Both groups were matched at baseline in terms of ventricular function. beta blockade resulted in similar reductions in heart rate and similar improvements in ejection fraction, ventricular volumes, stroke and minute work, peak +dP/dt, and isovolumic relaxation in both groups. Only patients taking bucindolol had a significant within-group decrease in resting left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The metoprolol group had a greater decrease in coronary sinus blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption. Bucindolol increased cardiac index more than metoprolol, but did not increase stroke volume index more than metoprolol. The bucindolol group had an increase in systolic elastance, whereas the metoprolol group had a parallel left shift in this relation. Thus, metoprolol reduces coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption more than bucindolol, whereas bucindolol produces slightly more favorable improvements in resting cardiac index and end-diastolic pressure. Otherwise, these 2 agents produced similar hemodynamic changes.",E,E
7856622,Venlafaxine: a heterocyclic antidepressant.,"Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation; Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic; Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic; Cyclohexanols; Depression; Drug Interactions; Humans; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors; Venlafaxine Hydrochloride","Ellingrod, V L; Perry, P J","The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride, a new antidepressant, are described. Venlafaxine inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. In animal models, it does not significantly inhibit muscarinic, histaminic, or adrenergic receptor activity and does not inhibit monoamine oxidase. Venlafaxine is rapidly absorbed and metabolized in the liver to its active metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV). Time to peak concentration is one to two hours for the parent compound and four to five hours for ODV. The pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine might be dose-dependent, although pharmacokinetic studies have had conflicting results. The major route of elimination is renal; thus, patients with renal dysfunction may require lower doses. In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of venlafaxine for maintenance therapy, venlafaxine has shown effective antidepressant activity in severely ill patients with major depression. Antidepressant effectiveness may be apparent within two weeks; this finding needs to be replicated. The dosage is 75-375 mg/day administered in two or three divided doses. The strength of the antidepressant response may be correlated with increasing dosage. Nausea is the most commonly reported adverse drug reaction (ADR). Others include somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, and sweating. All ADRs have commonly occurred at the beginning of therapy and decreased with time. Overall, venlafaxine is well tolerated. Venlafaxine is as effective as other available antidepressants. It may cause fewer anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and antiadrenergic ADRs and may have a quicker onset of therapeutic action than existing antidepressants.",E,E

It is well known that the synthesis of melatonin is under the control of pineal beta 1-adrenoreceptors. In this study the effect of ten weeks treatment with the beta-adrenoreceptor (beta-AR) blockers propranolol and ridazolol on melatonin synthesis and on sleep quality was examined in 42 patients suffering from essential hypertension. Before and after 6 and 10 weeks of beta-AR-blocker administration urinary sulfatoxymelatonin excretion rates were measured and sleep factors were evaluated by using a standardized sleep inventory consisting of self-rating sleepiness scales. After 6 and 10 weeks of treatment, a significant about 50 percent reduction of sulfatoxymelatonin was measured. No relationship between these reductions and changes in sleep factors was found. The results indicate that a reduced nightly amplitude of melatonin has minor significance for the organization of physiological sleep. Furthermore, it is suggested that pineal mechanisms beside the beta 1-adrenergic receptor transduction system serve to maintain the melatonin signal to a considerable extent during a chronic beta 1-AR blockade.",I,E

Thirty patients undergoing limb procedures with general anesthesia (N2O/narcotic technique) and a pneumatic tourniquet were randomized to receive either preoperative enalaprilat (1.25 mg intravenously [i.v.] 20 min prior to induction) or intraoperative enalaprilat (0.625 mg i.v. at the onset of tourniquet-associated hypertension), with appropriate placebo controls. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate increased significantly in response to intubation in the placebo group. Although there were no significant differences in catecholamine levels, plasma renin activity was significantly increased at postincision in the preoperative-enalaprilat group versus the placebo group. This suggests that activation of the renin-angiotensin system may play a key role in mediation of intraoperative hemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation. With respect to tourniquet hypertension, preoperative or intraoperative treatment with enalaprilat reduced neither the pressor response to tourniquet inflation nor the amount of enflurane subsequently required to control arterial blood pressure. These findings suggest that this response is mediated by pain pathways, and may be treated more effectively with anesthesia/analgesia.",E,E

In the case of acute MI, coronary care units, as presently used, are rather expensive but could be made much more efficient with more effective triage and resource utilization; reperfusion via thrombolysis is cost-effective, as are beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors post-MI in appropriate patients. Cost-effectiveness of CAD screening tests depends strongly on the prevalence of disease in the population studied. Cost-effectiveness of CABG surgery depends on targeting; eg, it is highly effective for such conditions as left-main and three-vessel disease but not for lesser disease. PTCA appears to be cost-effective in situations where there is clinical consensus for its use, eg, severe ischemia and one-vessel disease, but requires further analysis based on randomized data; coronary stents also appear to be cost-effective. In preliminary analysis, ACE inhibition for CHF dominates, ie, saves both money and lives. Cardiac transplant appears to be cost-effective but requires further study. For arrhythmias, implantable cardioverter defibrillators are cost-effective, especially the transvenous device, in life-threatening situations; radiofrequency ablation is also cost-effective in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome apart from asymptomatic individuals; and pacemakers have not been analyzed except in the case of biofascicular block, where results were variable depending on the situation and preceding tests.",E,E

To evaluate whether alteplase or c7E3 could influence the incidence of complications, we randomized 36 and 60 patients, respectively to alteplase or placebo, or c7E3 or placebo. All patients exhibited dynamic ECG changes and recurrent pain attacks, despite maximal tolerated medical therapy. Patients were randomized in both studies after initial angiography had demonstrated a culprit lesion amenable for angioplasty. After study drug infusion quantitative angiography was repeated and angioplasty performed. Recurrent ischemia during study drug infusion occurred in 5, 6, 9 and 16 patients from the alteplase, placebo, c7E3 and placebo group, respectively. Major events defined as death, myocardial infarction or urgent intervention occurred in 7, 3, 1 and 7 patients, respectively.

During all three treatment periods, distinct circadian variation of heart rate was documented by autocorrelation and Fourier analysis. Ischemia did not exhibit clear periodicity as indexed by autocorrelation in any period; however, it was coupled to heart rate in all treatment periods as reflected in cross-correlation analysis. Although diltiazem did not quantitatively alter the circadian characteristics of heart rate or ischemia, atenolol produced a shift in the coupling between remaining ischemia and heart rate in time.

Its renal vasodilating properties have been demonstrated both in animals and in man. The beta-blocking activity of tertatolol was assessed on the reduction of heart rate at submaximal exercise. The oral dose of 5 mg was optimal, leading to a significant reduction of diastolic blood pressure throughout 24 h. The efficacy was confirmed in mid- and long-term studies. In mid-term, randomized controlled studies, versus beta-blockers, the antihypertensive efficacy of tertatolol 5 mg was comparable to that of acebutolol 400 mg but of earlier onset, and comparable to that of atenolol 100 mg. Its efficacy was confirmed in 3 long-term studies. In the first study, tertatolol 5 mg alone or combined with a diuretic and, if necessary, dihydralazine, controlled 93.6% of patients (supine DBP < 90 mm Hg). 72.7% of patients were controlled with tertatolol alone, 16.4% with tertatolol plus diuretic, and 4.5% with tertatolol plus diuretic and dihydralazine. In a second study, 88.5% of patients were controlled, 56.3% with tertatolol alone and 32.2% with tertatolol plus diuretic. In the third study, 88.8% of patients were controlled after 1 year treatment, 66.1% with tertatolol alone and 22.7% with tertatolol plus diuretic. The overall clinical safety was excellent: only 6.6% of the 2,706 patients treated for 1 year withdrew from the study because of side effects. In patients followed for 1 year, side effects were rare, transient and mostly of mild severity. Biochemical surveillance did not show any adverse metabolic effects of tertatolol. Conversely, in two long-term studies, creatinine and cholesterol levels decreased significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

In a first study [Paillard et al., 1986], tertatolol (T) 5 mg and propranolol (Pr) 160 mg (SR) were given orally for 15 days to 2 groups of 9 patients with essential hypertension. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), measured by inulin clearance and renal plasma flow (RPF) measured by PAH clearance increased in T group (+8.9%, p = 0.038 and + 13.0%, p = 0.007, respectively) and decreased in Pr group (-2.8%, NS and -13.4%, p < 0.001, respectively). Two clinical pharmacology studies [Leeman et al., 1986; Nitenberg et al., 1990] have shown specific and selective effects of tertatolol on the renal vasculature. In 8 hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure, the effects of tertatolol 5 mg were evaluated before and after 3 months of treatment on GFR using inulin clearance, and RPF, using PAH clearance [Hannedouche et al., 1991]. After 3 months of treatment, GFR and effective RPF increased significantly by 10 and 13%, respectively, whereas RVR decreased by 16% and the filtration fraction was unchanged. In summary, tertatolol 5 mg, contrasting with other beta-blockers, possesses a selective effect on the renal circulation beneficial to hypertensive patients. The mechanisms of this renal vasodilatation are not fully understood but might involve renal 5-HT1A receptor stimulation.",E,E

The aim of this study was to compare the safety and antihypertensive efficacy of 25 to 50 mg carvedilol once daily with 50 to 100 mg atenolol once daily in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. This was a multicenter study conducted in Europe. After a single-blind placebo run-in phase, 325 eligible patients with stable hypertension were randomized to receive 25 mg carvedilol once daily (161 patients) or 50 mg atenolol (164 patients) in a double-blind 8-week treatment phase. After 4 weeks, the dosage was doubled if there was inadequate response. The primary index of efficacy (response) was the reduction of mean sitting diastolic blood pressure to 90 mg Hg or less (normalized) or by at least 10 mm Hg from baseline. At each of three to six run-in phase visits and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of treatment, sitting blood pressure and heart rate at trough were measured in triplicate, and body weight, adverse experiences, compliance, and use of concomitant medications were assessed. Laboratory tests, including fasting serum lipids, and electrocardiograms were also monitored during the trial.

The study was performed in 24 patients with documented coronary artery disease and stable angina pectoris according to a double-blind randomized study, designed using conventional symptom-limited exercise testing. Exercise testing 3 h after the first dose showed a more marked ST-segment reduction by atenolol than by nebivolol (59% vs. 18%). ST-segment depression measured 24 h after administration of the penultimate dose was statistically significantly reduced by nebivolol (from 0.19 +/- 0.07 to 0.13 +/- 0.07 mV; P = 0.0059) but not by atenolol (from 0.17 +/- 0.06 to 0.14 +/- 0.10 mV; P = 0.0703). Approximately 3 h after the last dose, the reduction was comparable (45% and 38% by nebivolol and atenolol, respectively). Exercise duration, exercise time necessary to produce ST-segment depression by 0.1 mV and exercise time to the onset of angina were also prolonged following administration of both drugs. Thus, at steady-state single daily doses of 100 mg atenolol and 5 mg nebivolol were about equieffective when measured at time of maximal effect (i.e. 3 h after drug administration). However, duration of action with respect to the ST-segment depression seems to be slightly longer for nebivolol.",E,E

A clinical study was performed in 30 patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease and systemic hypertension to compare the effects of single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg celiprolol (n = 16) (third generation beta-blocking agent) and metoprolol (n = 14) (second generation) on left ventricular diastolic function. Parameters derived from pressure, volume, flow, time intervals and their combination were used to characterise diastolic function. After celiprolol administration, parameters of diastolic myocardial function improve (dp/dtip-; relaxation time constant T1, peak filling rate PFR; first-third filling rate FF1/3 or diastolic wall stress-time integral Sigdiasc) or remain unchanged. In contrast, after metoprolol administration parameters of diastolic function seem to be deteriorated (dp/dtip-, T1; Sigdiasc). This indicates an improvement in myocardial relaxation and filling under the influence of celiprolol but not under metoprolol. The left shift of the pressure-volume loops after celiprolol (n = 13), in contrast to metoprolol, supports this interpretation. Celiprolol did not show any deterioration of diastolic function in patients with coronary heart disease and arterial hypertension under these acute conditions.",E,E

Beta blockers, mainly metoprolol, were prescribed for 66% of all survivors at discharge. They were more frequently prescribed for younger patients and for those with a previous history of AMI and hypertension, but less frequently for those with a history of congestive heart failure and diabetes mellitus. Patients for whom beta blockers were not prescribed haa a 1-year mortality of 27% versus 11% for the rest (p < 0.001). Independent predictors of 1-year mortality after discharge were age (p < 0.001), history of hypertension (p < 0.001), prescription of beta blockers at discharge (p < 0.001), congestive heart failure during hospitalization (p < 0.001), and a history of AMI (p < 0.01). P values were corrected for baseline differences. Beta blockers were not prescribed at discharge for one-third of survivors after AMI. This group had a very high mortality during the first year.

The mean fall in DBP at end point was -5.6 mm Hg in the benazepril group and -3.7 mm Hg in the placebo group. Because six patients in the benazepril group experienced an increase of blood pressure that offset the fall observed in the responders, the difference in DBP response between the benazepril group and the placebo group was not statistically significant.

After a 4-week placebo run-in period, each beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker was administered at a dosage of 100 mg once daily for 6 weeks. Quality of life was assessed regularly during the active treatment phases by use of two standardized self-administered questionnaires, the minor symptom evaluation (MSE) profile, and the psychologic general well-being (PGWB) index. Both questionnaires have previously been shown to be effective in detecting CNS symptoms and changes in well being produced by beta-blockers. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored to assess the antihypertensive efficacy of the two drugs. Metoprolol CR and atenolol produced equivalent, clinically effective reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures measured 24 hours after administration. The drugs were found to exert similar effects on general well being, as assessed by the PGWB index, and there were no significant differences between the two treatments with regard to the three dimensions of the MSE profile, contentment, vitality, and sleep. Thus, at equivalent antihypertensive dosages, metoprolol CR and atenolol are clinically comparable with regard to the degree of CNS-related symptoms produced and effects on general well being. Because these agents differ markedly in lipophilicity, other factors, such as beta 1-selectivity/nonselectivity, may be more important determinants of whether these subjective symptoms occur during therapy with beta-blockers.",I,E

Thus, we undertook an extensive hemodynamic evaluation of this mechanism. In addition, because animal models have shown that catecholamine exposure may increase relative fatty acid utilization, we hypothesized that antagonism of sympathetic stimulation may result in increased carbohydrate utilization.; This was a randomized, double-blind, prospective trial in which 24 men with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy underwent cardiac catheterization before and after 3 months of therapy with metoprolol (n = 15) or placebo (n = 9) in addition to standard therapy. Pressure-volume relations were examined using a micromanometer catheter and digital ventriculography.; At baseline, the placebo-treated patients had somewhat more advanced left ventricular dysfunction. Ejection fraction and left ventricular performance improved only in the metoprolol-treated patients. Stroke and minute work increased without an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption, suggesting increased myocardial efficiency. Further increases in ejection fraction were seen between 3 and 6 months in the metoprolol group. The placebo group had a significant increase in ejection fraction only after crossover to metoprolol. A significant relation between the change in coronary sinus norepinephrine and myocardial respiratory quotient was seen, suggesting a possible effect of adrenergic deactivation on substrate utilization.; These data demonstrate that in patients with cardiomyopathy, metoprolol treatment improves myocardial performance and energetics, and favorably alters substrate utilization. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as metoprolol, are hemodynamically and energetically beneficial in the treatment of myocardial failure.",E,E

Low-risk patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation may not need to be hospitalized. Beta blockers may be the most effective drugs for controlling the heart rate. When a patient does not respond to drug therapy, it is still appropriate to search for the cause of the arrhythmia and to use direct-current cardioversion. Clear evidence now exists that patients with chronic atrial fibrillation should be given anticoagulant drugs to reduce the risk of stroke. Antiarrhythmic drugs should be used cautiously, because they may cause life-threatening arrhythmias.",I,E

Particular concern has existed that lowering systolic blood pressure in older persons might have adverse consequences on cognition, mood, or leisure activities.; A multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted over an average of 5 years' followup involving 16 academic clinical trial clinics. Participants consisted of 4736 persons (1.06%) selected from 447,921 screenees aged 60 years and older. Systolic blood pressure at baseline ranged from 160 to 219 mm Hg, while diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg. Participants were randomized to active antihypertensive drug therapy or matching placebo. Active treatment consisted of 12.5 to 25 mg of chlorthalidone for step 1, while step 2 consisted of 25 to 50 mg of atenolol. If atenolol was contraindicated, 0.05 to 0.10 mg of reserpine could be used for the second-step drug. The impact of drug treatment on measures of cognitive, emotional, and physical function and leisure activities was assessed.; Our analyses demonstrate that active treatment of isolated systolic hypertension in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program cohort had no measured negative effects and, for some measures, a slight positive effect on cognitive, physical, and leisure function. The positive findings in favor of the treatment group were small. There was no effect on measures related to emotional state. Measures of cognitive and emotional function were stable in both groups for the duration of the study. Both treatment groups showed a modest trend toward deterioration of some measures of physical and leisure function over the study period.; The overall study cohort exhibited decline over time in activities of daily living, particularly the more strenuous ones, and some decline in certain leisure activities. However, mood, cognitive function, basic self-care, and moderate leisure activity were remarkably stable for both the active and the placebo groups throughout the entire study. Results of this study support the inference that medical treatment of isolated systolic hypertension does not cause deterioration in measures of cognition, emotional state, physical function, or leisure activities.",I,E

Prior to these 16 weeks there was a placebo wash-out period of 2-6 weeks. Blood pressure measurements, euglycaemic, hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamps, and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) were performed at baseline and after 4 and 16 weeks. Blood lipid status was evaluated at baseline and 16 weeks. The insulin sensitivity index (M/I) increased by 12% during the prolonged placebo period, and subsequently decreased by 12% during treatment with atenolol in that group. A post-hoc analysis of covariance indicated that the increase in insulin sensitivity during the initial 4 weeks may have been due to carry-over effects from previous antihypertensive treatment. Fosinopril increased glucose disappearance during IVGTT at 4 and 16 weeks (k values 1.46 and 1.33 vs 1.10 at baseline) but had no effect on insulin sensitivity. The change in insulin sensitivity and serum triglycerides during treatment with fosinopril was related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in serum. In conclusion, carry-over effects from previous antihypertensive medication were indicated in this study, probably because of an insufficient wash-out period in many patients. Therefore, 4 weeks of placebo wash-out in all patients is advisable in this kind of investigation.",E,E

Felodipine, 5 mg once daily, significantly improved both time to ischemic threshold and pain threshold (p = 0.02 and p = 0.003, respectively, vs placebo), and tended to increase total exercise time (p = 0.06 vs placebo). In contrast, ISMN, 20 mg twice daily, did not significantly affect these parameters. Comparison of the 2 active treatment arms showed that, overall, felodipine was more effective than ISMN, with a statistically significant difference for time to ischemic threshold (p = 0.02). With regard to safety, felodipine was also better tolerated than ISMN, which led to more patients discontinuing study medication with ISMN (p < 0.05 between ISMN and felodipine).

For all outcomes except cardiac mortality, two to four times as many of the younger subjects as the older subjects needed to be treated for 5 years to prevent morbid and mortal events. No significant effect on cardiac mortality was seen among younger subjects, while 78 older subjects (95% CI, 50 to 180) needed to be treated to prevent a fatal cardiac event.; Randomized trials demonstrate that treating healthy older persons with hypertension is highly efficacious. Five-year morbidity and mortality benefits derived from trials are greater for older than younger subjects. Extrapolating benefits from trials to individual patients is difficult, but should take into account multiple issues including the patient's risk factors, preexisting cardiovascular disease, and competing comorbid illnesses.",I,8

Diuretics caused relative increases in cholesterol levels (regression coefficient = 0.13 mmol/L; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.18 mmol/L) that were greater with higher doses (additional effect of high dose, 0.12 mmol/L; CI, 0.04 to 0.20 mmol/L) and were worse in blacks than in nonblacks (additional effect in blacks, 0.13 mmol/L; CI, 0.01 to 0.26 mmol/L). Beta-blockers caused increases in triglyceride levels (0.35 mmol/L; CI, 0.31 to 0.39 mmol/L) that were substantially smaller for agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (amelioration of beta-blocker increase, -0.21 mmol/L; CI, -0.27 to -0.16 mmol/L). When combined with cardioselectivity, beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity favorably affected lipids and reduced both total (-0.14 mmol/L; CI, -0.24 to -0.04 mmol/L) and LDL cholesterol levels (-0.17 mmol/L; CI, -0.28 to -0.07 mmol/L). alpha-Blockers beneficially affected total cholesterol (-0.23 mmol/L; CI, -0.28 to -0.18 mmol/L), LDL cholesterol (-0.20 mmol/L; CI, -0.25 to 0.15 mmol/L), triglycerides (-0.07 mmol/L; CI, -0.11 to -0.03 mmol/L), and, in younger persons, HDL cholesterol (0.02 mmol/L; 0.01 to 0.04 mmol/L).

However, it is unknown whether aspirin can modify blood pressure values either in treated or untreated hypertensive patients, as described for other non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Thus 30 patients. 10 with mild uncomplicated and untreated essential hypertension, 10 with essential hypertension under chronic treatment with captopril, 50 mg bid, and 10 with essential hypertension under chronic treatment with atenolol, 100 mg oid, received aspirin, 100 mg oid, and the corresponding placebo for one month, according to a double blind randomized cross-over design. At the end of each treatment, blood pressure, heart rate, generated serum thromboxane B2 and urinary excretion of thromboxane B2 and 6 keto prostaglandin F1 alpha and plasma renin activity were measured. Both in treated and untreated essential hypertensive patients, aspirin administration did not affect blood pressure, heart rate and urinary 6 keto prostaglandin F1 alpha, while it significantly reduced serum and urinary excretion of thromboxane B2 and plasma renin activity. In conclusion, while the present data confirm that low doses of aspirin selectively inhibit thromboxane B2 synthesis, they indicate that aspirin at 100 mg oid can be administered to treated and untreated essential hypertensive patients without any harmful effect on blood pressure values.",E,E

However, most cardiac ischemia is asymptomatic, and although therapeutic strategies ranging from no medication to revascularization are being used to treat ischemia, no prospective study evaluating different treatment strategies has been reported.; Patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease and ischemia on exercise and ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) in 11 clinical units were randomized to receive angina-guided medical therapy, angina-guided plus ambulatory ECG ischemia-guided medical therapy or revascularization (coronary angioplasty or bypass surgery). Patients were also randomized to receive either diltiazem plus isosorbide dinitrate or atenolol plus nifedipine when possible. After anti-ischemic medication adjustment to control angina, blinded medication was adjusted in the medical therapy groups to eliminate ischemia in the ischemia-guided group. The primary outcome was the absence of ischemia at 12 weeks. Follow-up was scheduled for 1 year.; A total of 1,959 patients were screened by ambulatory ECG monitoring; 982 (49%) had asymptomatic ischemia, and 618 (65%) were enrolled in the study.

The study was designed to examine the effects of medical treatment to control angina compared with treatment strategies guided by ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) ischemia or coronary anatomy.; Treatments to suppress ischemia (asymptomatic and symptomatic) have not been evaluated in a large prospective, randomized trial. Before undertaking such a trial, issues about recruitment and treatment strategies must be addressed.; The 618 enrolled patients had coronary artery disease suitable for revascularization, ischemia on stress test and asymptomatic ischemia on ambulatory ECG. Patients were assigned randomly to one of three treatment strategies: 1) angina-guided medical strategy with titration of anti-ischemic medication to relieve angina (angina-guided strategy); 2) angina-guided plus ambulatory ECG ischemia-guided medical strategy with titration of anti-ischemic medication to eliminate both angina and ambulatory ECG ischemia (ischemia-guided strategy); and 3) revascularization by angioplasty or bypass surgery (revascularization strategy).; Ambulatory ECG ischemia was no longer present at the week 12 visit in 39% of patients assigned to the angina-guided strategy, 41% of patients assigned to the ischemia-guided strategy and 55% of patients assigned to the revascularization strategy. All strategies reduced the median number of episodes and total duration of ST segment depression during follow-up ambulatory ECG monitoring. Revascularization was the most effective strategy. Treadmill test results were concordant with those of ambulatory ECG monitoring. For most patients in the two medical strategies, angina was controlled with low to moderate doses of anti-ischemic medication, and the majority of patients (65%) in the revascularization strategy did not require medication for angina.; This pilot study demonstrated that cardiac ischemia can be suppressed in 40% to 55% of patients with either low or moderate doses of medication or revascularization and that a large trial is feasible.",E,E

Insulin sensitivity was measured with the euglycemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp. Blood glucose and plasma insulin were analysed in the fasting state and during an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). Lipoprotein fractions were analysed in serum. After three months, SBP and DBP in the standing position decreased to the same extent after the two drugs whereas the decrease in supine SBP did not reach statistical significance in the doxazosin group.

Twenty-six patients referred for evaluation of chest pain were studied twice, on and off metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. (in random order sequence) with a wash-out period of at least 48 h. Dobutamine stress echocardiography was performed using up to 40 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, followed, if necessary, by the addition of atropine to achieve 85% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate, unless symptoms or markers of ischaemia appeared. Atropine was given to patients on beta-blockers more often [(22/26) vs (6/26)] than to those off beta-blockers (P < 0.001). Heart rate at every stage of the test was lower on beta-blockers. Chest pain occurred in patients on beta-blockers significantly less than in those off beta-blockers (8% vs 46%), and the addition of atropine made no significant difference (31% vs 46%).

The addition of hydrochlorothiazide (or bisoprolol) to therapy with bisoprolol (or hydrochlorothiazide) produced an incremental reduction in blood pressure. Dosages of hydrochlorothiazide as low as 6.25 mg/d contributed a significant antihypertensive effect. A hydrochlorothiazide dosage of 6.25 mg/d produced significantly less hypokalemia and less of an increase in uric acid levels than a dosage of 25 mg/d. The low-dose combination of bisoprolol, 2.5 mg/d, and hydrochlorothiazide, 6.25 mg/d, reduced diastolic blood pressure to lower than 90 mm Hg in 61% of patients and demonstrated a safety profile that compared favorably with that of placebo.; The utility of factorial design trials to characterize dose-response relationships and to test the potential interactions between various antihypertensive agents has been demonstrated.

The treatment arms included front-loaded recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), anistreplase (APSAC), or both, in conjunction with an intravenous bolus of 5000 U of heparin, followed by 1000 U/h. To facilitate anticoagulation, a heparin nomogram was developed to maintain the therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time at 1 1/2 to 2 times the control value.; A poll revealed that nine centers made use of the recommended heparin nomogram and six did not, adjusting the heparin dosage according to local practice. Anticoagulation parameters, major hemorrhagic events, and the frequency of heparin interruption were compared between centers that used and did not use the nomogram.; Subtherapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time values were noted in 4%, 14%, 29%, 46%, 37%, and 34% of patients 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours, respectively, after heparin treatment was begun. Patients with subtherapeutic values at 24 hours were younger (mean +/- SD, 55.2 +/- 10.6 vs 59.6 +/- 10.6 years, P = .02) and weighed more (86.4 +/- 13.5 vs 78.9 +/- 15.7 kg, P = .007) than patients with therapeutic values. Centers that used the nomogram had significantly fewer subtherapeutic values at 48 and 96 hours. In addition, heparin therapy was interrupted less frequently at centers that used the nomogram (38.1% vs 68.7%, P < .001). Major spontaneous hemorrhage, reinfarction, and reocclusion rates were low and were about the same in the two groups.; The use of a heparin nomogram provided improved anticoagulation in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy for myocardial infarction. Weight- and age-adjusted heparin dosing may provide further improvement in anticoagulation with heparin therapy. Our findings support the need for frequent monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time and for a standardized approach to adjusting the heparin dosage.",E,E

Results indicated a lack of consistent drug effects on measures of sexual response, although more frequent sexual and nonsexual side effects were observed with methyldopa and propranolol. As in our previous studies, age was negatively correlated with both hormonal and NPT measures, whereas changes in blood pressure were not significantly related to sexual function scores.

Measurements were performed pre-induction of anaesthesia.; In the hypertensive subjects, cuff systolic BP (SBP) was lower than I-BP by an average of 8 mmHg (placebo-) and 7 mmHg (metoprolol-treated), whereas diastolic A-BP (A-DBP) was 3 and 7 mmHg higher, respectively. In the normotensive subjects, mean A-SBP and I-SBP agreed closely, whereas A-DBP was 11 mmHg higher. Thus, SBP differences (i.e. indirect-direct BP) were significantly less and DBP differences significantly greater in the normotensive than in the hypertensive subjects (P < 0.05). Plasma renin activity and adrenalin showed better correlations with A-MBP than with I-MBP.; The drift of cuff systolic readings fell progressively below the intrabrachial values when BP increased, whilst diastolic cuff values approached the direct pressures.

Significant alterations in rheological parameters such as plasma and whole blood viscosity, fibrinogen level and red cell deformability were not found. Higher cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were observed after propranolol treatment but not in verapamil treatment. Side-effects were mild, tolerated and no patient had to be withdrawn from the study.

Metoprolol is known to attenuate the postoperative hypertensive response after hypotensive anaesthesia and this study was carried out to evaluate the effect of metoprolol on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) before extubation and cerebral arteriovenous oxygen content difference (AVDO2), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), PaO2 and PaCO2 in a 180-min period after extubation. Twenty patients anaesthetized with thiopentone, fentanyl, nitrous oxide 67%, and halothane 0.5% were randomized to receive intravenous metoprolol or placebo at the end of the peroperative period. There were no significant differences in CBF- and CMRO2 values between the two groups. In the period between closure of the dura and 5 min after extubation, an increase in MABP was observed in the control group (P < 0.05), but not in the metoprolol group. During the same period a decrease in AVDO2 was observed in both groups (P < 0.05); during the next 10 min an increase was observed, but with no difference in AVDO2 values between the groups. A higher level of PaO2 in the metoprolol group was observed in the postoperative period. These findings suggest that peroperative treatment with metoprolol reduces postoperative MABP but does not influence the cerebral blood flow and metabolism.",E,E

We carried out a multicenter, randomized double-blind clinical trial with 309 hypertensive women aged 60 to 80 years to assess effects of atenolol, enalapril, and isradipine on measures of quality of life over a 22-week period. The patients had mild to moderate hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide was added to treatment if monotherapy was inadequate in lowering blood pressure. At the conclusion of the trial the three drug groups did not differ in degree of reduction of diastolic blood pressure or in supplementation with hydrochlorothiazide. Over the 22-week trial, linear trend analysis showed no differences between the treatment groups in change from baseline on quality of life measures of well-being, physical status, emotional status, cognitive functioning, and social role participation. Regarding each of 33 physical side effects over the 22 weeks, we found no general difference between atenolol, enalapril, and isradipine groups on measures of change in distress over symptoms except for enalapril patients who worsened in distress over cough (P = .001) and atenolol patients who worsened in distress over dry mouth (P = .014). Centering on three medications that are relatively new additions to the armamentarium for blood pressure control, the findings underline the increasing opportunities for the physician to select drugs that can control blood pressure while maintaining the quality of life of elderly hypertensive women.",I,E

The physiological effects of the acute administration of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were assessed by performing post-exercise Doppler-echocardiography study. Eleven patients and six control subjects were studied. According to a double-blind randomized protocol, 5 mg of metoprolol or placebo was administered before cycloergometer exercise. 2. In patients, after metoprolol, a significant decrease in heart rate and systolic blood pressure, as well as in peak aortic acceleration and cardiac output, was observed 2 min after exercise. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter did not change from baseline values either after placebo or metoprolol. In normal subjects, as compared with placebo, a decrease in heart rate and peak aortic acceleration was observed after metoprolol, whereas systolic blood pressure did not change. A similar increase in cardiac output occurred after metoprolol, as compared with placebo, associated with an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and stroke volume. 3. Post-exercise Doppler echocardiography is a means of assessing haemodynamic changes occurring during exercise in patients with congestive heart failure. Although acute metoprolol administration does not provide beneficial haemodynamic effects, a decrease in the energy requirements of the heart and a faster recovery after exercise may participate in the long-term beneficial action of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.",E,E

Meta-analyses of these variables were done for all randomized, controlled trials; for all randomized, uncontrolled trials; and for several subgroups.; When pooled, NSAIDs elevated supine mean blood pressure by 5.0 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.2 to 8.7 mm Hg) but had no effect on variables other than blood pressure. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs antagonized the antihypertensive effect of beta-blockers (blood pressure elevation, 6.2 mm Hg; CI, 1.1 to 11.4 mm Hg) more than did vasodilators and diuretics. Among NSAIDs, piroxicam produced the most marked elevation in blood pressure (6.2 mm Hg; CI, 0.8 to 11.5 mm Hg), whereas sulindac and aspirin had the least hypertensive effect.; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may elevate blood pressure and antagonize the blood pressure-lowering effect of antihypertensive medication to an extent that may potentially increase hypertension-related morbidity. Although certain NSAIDs and antihypertensive agents could be more likely to produce these effects, the underlying mechanisms require further study.",E,E

Blood pressure and fasting blood lipids were determined at baseline and 4, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment. At entry, plasma lipids and lipoproteins were similar in those patients randomized to doxazosin or atenolol. After 24 weeks of treatment with atenolol, there were significant (P < .05) decreases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and increases in triglycerides and very-low-density triglycerides (VLDL-T). In contrast, doxazosin was associated with significant (P < .05) increases in HDL-C and decreases in triglycerides and VLDL-T. There were no significant differences in HDL apolipoprotein (apo) A-I or low-density lipoprotein apoB between the drugs, but atenolol decreased the ratio of HDL-C to apoA-I, and doxazosin increased this ratio, differences that were statistically significant (P < .002). Neither apoA-I nor apoB concentration at baseline nor apoE phenotype was predictive of the lipid responses during antihypertensive treatment with either drug. Thus, there are significant favorable changes in HDL-C, total triglycerides, and VLDL-T between patients with mild to moderate hypertension and normal plasma lipids when treated with the alpha-blocker doxazosin compared with the beta-blocker atenolol.

Since the introduction of sclerotherapy for the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices, the number of surgical procedures has sharply decreased. Until the early 1980s, however, the treatment of choice of bleeding esophageal varices was based on different variations of two main types of open surgery: devacularization and transection operations and portosystemic shunts. The experience with nonshunt procedures is limited in the pediatric population. Literature reports from the last 25 years have emphasized a number of restrictions related to portosystemic shunts in small subjects. However, portosystemic shunts, selective or not, can be performed even in very young subjects with high rates of success. From 1974 to 1984 the distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS) was the procedure of choice for the treatment of children with variceal bleeding in our institution. Forty-two children underwent DSRS during this period. Since 1985, when endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS) replaced DSRS as the first therapeutic option in our service, this shunt has been performed in only 8 children in whom EVS has failed, none of them during the last 2 years. In this cohort of 50 cases of DSRS, the shunt patency has increased from 71% in the first 7 patients to 95% thereafter. There has been no perioperative mortality. From 1985 to April 1993, 107 children were submitted to EVS sessions for the treatment of esophageal varices bleeding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",E,E

Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to determine if treatment reduces adverse outcome in patients with daily life ischemia.; A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic outpatients with daily life silent ischemia due to coronary artery disease was conducted. The primary outcome measure was event-free survival at 1 year by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Events were death, resuscitated ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, aggravation of angina, or revascularization. The secondary outcome was ischemia during ambulatory ECG monitoring at 4 weeks. Three hundred six outpatients with mild or no angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class I or II), abnormal exercise tests, and ischemia on ambulatory monitoring were randomized to receive either atenolol (100 mg/d) or placebo. After 4 weeks of treatment, the number (mean +/- SD, 3.6 +/- 4.2 versus 1.7 +/- 4.6 episodes, P < .001) and average duration (30 +/- 3.3 versus 16.4 +/- 6.7 minutes, P < .001) of ischemic episodes per 48 hours of ambulatory monitoring decreased in atenolol- compared with placebo-assigned patients (4.4 +/- 4.6 to 3.1 +/- 6.0 episodes and 36.6 +/- 4.1 to 30 +/- 5.5 minutes). Event-free survival improved in atenolol-treated patients (P < .0066), who had an increased time to onset of first adverse event (120 versus 79 days) and fewer total first events compared with placebo (relative risk, 0.44; 95% confidence intervals, 0.26 to 0.75; P = .001).

The most powerful univariate and multivariate correlate of event-free survival was absence of ischemia on ambulatory monitoring at 4 weeks. Side effects were mild and generally similar comparing atenolol- and placebo-treated patients, although bradycardia was more frequent with atenolol.; Atenolol treatment reduced daily life ischemia and was associated with reduced risk for adverse outcome in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients compared with placebo.",I,I

We measured ambulatory blood pressure by cuff monitor in relation to 24-h urinary excretion of E and NE at sea level and during 3 wk of residence at 4,300 m (Pikes Peak, CO) in 11 healthy men. In five subjects taking placebo, arterial pressure progressively increased at 4,300 m from 82 +/- 1 (SE) mmHg at sea level to 88 +/- 3 on day 2, 91 +/- 3 on day 8, and 97 +/- 6 on day 17.

Mean office blood pressure (sitting) of the 91 patients who completed the study according to the protocol was reduced from 161/100 to 147/91 mm Hg after 4 weeks of treatment carvedilol 25 mg OD. Continuation of carvedilol 25 mg produced no further reduction in blood pressure. Increasing carvedilol to 50 mg OD or addition of diuretics further reduced blood pressure. Ambulatory blood pressure measurements showed a significant reduction in both SBP and DBP after 3 months treatment in the three groups, as well as with respect to the circadian profile of blood pressure and heart rate. Large differences between ambulatory and office blood pressure were observed: 37% of the patients diagnosed as mild to moderate hypertensives according to office blood pressure before treatment had mean daytime DBP < 90 mm Hg and 39% mean daytime SBP < 140 mm Hg. Twenty-eight percent of the patients experienced adverse events; they occurred mainly at the beginning of treatment; less than 5% of participants withdrew due to adverse events.

Of 496 patients, 431 had both baseline and ""1-year"" mood scores. Patients, stratified by obesity, were randomized to one of three groups: continue the HDFP medication; discontinue medication with no dietary intervention, or with sodium restriction and potassium increase; or, for those overweight, to a weight reduction intervention. Depression was assessed using the CES-D scale (Center for Epidemiological Studies--Depressed Mood), administered at baseline and again approximately 1 year after randomization. Of the seven treatment groups, only those who continued their HDFP medication showed significant improvement in mood from baseline. The overweight continue-medication group showed significantly greater improvement compared to the no-drugs, no-diet intervention groups, and to the overweight sodium-restriction group. Patients who had their blood pressure successfully controlled with weight reduction had a significant improvement in mood from 11.0 scale points to 8.0, P = .006. Comparisons between those withdrawn from diuretic alone and those withdrawn from both diuretic plus reserpine were inconclusive.

Hirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has been shown in experimental models to enhance thrombolysis and reduce reocclusion.; The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 5 trial was a randomized, dose-ranging, pilot trial of hirudin versus heparin, given with front-loaded tissue-type plasminogen activator and aspirin to 246 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Patients received either intravenous heparin or hirudin at one of four ascending doses for 5 days. Patients underwent coronary angiography at 90 min and at 18 to 36 h, unless rescue angioplasty was performed.; The primary end point, TIMI grade 3 flow in the infarct-related artery at 90 min and 18 to 36 h without death or reinfarction before the 18- to 36-h catheterization was achieved in 97 (61.8%) of 157 evaluable hirudin-treated patients compared with 39 (49.4%) of 79 evaluable heparin-treated patients (p = 0.07).

There appears to be a higher rate of sexual dysfunction in untreated hypertensive men compared with normotensive men. Sexual dysfunction increases with age and is associated with physical and emotional symptoms. There are few studies assessing sexual dysfunction with female and African-American hypertensive patients. Sexual dysfunction is associated with impairment of quality of life and noncompliance. Since group data may hide individual drug effects, baseline data should be collected on all patients before initiating therapy with any antihypertensive agent. Although questionnaires may not provide objective information on sexual dysfunction, the response rate to direct questioning may be less than the response rate on a questionnaire and may be affected by the gender or race of the interviewer. Research protocols using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design should assess sexual dysfunction in men and women in a standardized fashion.",E,E

To date, heparin and thrombolytic therapy has not provided complete or consistent benefit. We hypothesized that recombinant hirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, would prevent accumulation of coronary artery thrombus in a manner superior to heparin.; Patients with rest ischemic pain, abnormal ECG, and baseline angiogram indicating a > or = 60% stenosis of a culprit coronary artery or saphenous vein graft with visual appearance of thrombus were randomized to one of two different doses of heparin (either a target activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] of 65 to 90 or 90 to 110 seconds) or one of four doses of hirudin (0.05, 0.10, 0.20, or 0.30 mg.kg-1.h-1 infusion) in a dose-escalating protocol. After 72 to 120 hours of study drug, a repeat coronary angiogram was obtained, and the paired studies underwent quantitative analysis. The primary end point was change in the average cross-sectional area of the culprit lesion. Other efficacy end points also involved changes in culprit lesion dimensions and TIMI flow grade. Recombinant hirudin led to a dose-dependent elevation of aPTT that appeared to plateau at the 0.2-mg/kg dose. A higher proportion of hirudin-treated patients had their aPTT within a 40-second range (16% heparin versus 71% hirudin, P < .001). Overall, the 116 patients treated with hirudin tended to show more improvement than the 50 patients receiving heparin relative to the primary efficacy variable--the average cross-sectional area (P = .08)--as well as minimal cross-sectional area (P = .028), minimal luminal diameter (P = .029), and percent diameter stenosis (P = .07).; Recombinant hirudin appears to be a promising antithrombotic intervention compared with heparin for inhibition of coronary artery thrombus.

The study was a randomized, open-label, parallel comparison of 50 weeks' duration. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio (amlodipine n = 92: HCTZ n = 47). Atenolol was added at week 12 if monotherapy was inadequate. At week 12, the mean reductions for supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure values with amlodipine were found to be -15.2/-12.3 mmHg and -14.0/-11.6 mmHg respectively, as compared to -15.5/-11.1 mmHg and -16.1/-10.1 mmHg after treatment with HCTZ. The percentage of patients responding to treatment at week 12 was 74% on amlodipine and 70% on HCTZ. The addition of atenolol in those patients not adequately controlled on monotherapy produced additional mean reductions in supine and standing systolic and diastolic pressures in both the amlodipine-atenolol group and in the HCTZ-atenolol group. The incidence of adverse effects was 47% with amlodipine and 26% with HCTZ at 12 weeks. Overall, six patients were discontinued because of side effects while receiving amlodipine monotherapy and one from the HCTZ monotherapy group; none were discontinued because of side effects on combination therapy.

The glucose uptake was not particularly decreased in these subjects.; The study shows that metformin has some favourable effects on metabolism and that metoprolol CR is fairly neutral in this regard. The lack of effect of metformin on glucose disposal rate and blood pressure can be explained by the fact that the individuals studied were neither insulin resistant nor hypertensive. The data does not preclude an antihypertensive effect by treating a concomitant insulin resistance.",E,E

In order to investigate for differences in the effects of antihypertensive drugs on circadian changes we utilised a recently described modified cumulative sums technique to quantify circadian alteration magnitude (CAM). CAM is simply calculated as the difference between crest and trough blood pressures, the mean blood pressures of the 6-h periods of highest and lowest sustained pressures respectively. The records from all 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring performed over a 7 year period on subjects either on no medication (1208), or on treatment with a single first-line antihypertensive agent (578), were examined retrospectively. A sample (n = 40) stratified for trough diastolic blood pressure, age and sex was randomly selected from each of the following 5 groups: subjects on no medication, and subjects being treated with bendrofluazide, atenolol, class 2 calcium-channel blockers or captopril alone.

A calculation model was used that allowed to determine the drug-specific effects on arterial diameter and compliance under isobaric conditions. Isradipine increased measured and isobaric diameter during short-term (p < 0.05) and long-term administration (p < 0.05) whereas metoprolol did not change it.

Drug-specific effects on compliance were different during short-term and long-term administration (p < 0.01); the diameter was influenced differently only during short-term administration (p < 0.05). These opposite drug effects on the A. brachialis are probably due to a vasoselective relaxation of smooth muscle in large arteries by isradipine and-in the case of metoprolol-arterial constriction.

The drug's electrophysiologic and clinical profile is different from that of conventional beta-receptor antagonists. As compared with other antiarrhythmic agents, sotalol prevents recurrences of arrhythmia in a higher proportion of patients, particularly among those presenting with ventricular tachycardia and aborted sudden cardiac death. The net hemodynamic effect of sotalol is the result of a balance between the depressant effects due to beta-receptor blockade and an action that tends to increase contractility. Although initially marketed in the United States for treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, sotalol also has demonstrated efficacy in many patients with supraventricular arrhythmias.

Emphasis has been placed on the effects of antihypertensive treatment on renal hemodynamics and preservation of renal function. It has been suggested that some classes of antihypertensive agents may confer a greater renoprotective effect, especially agents that lower glomerular capillary pressure. Conversely, by virtue of their ability to preferentially dilate the afferent arteriole calcium antagonists theoretically could favor an increase in glomerular capillary pressure thereby accelerating the decline of renal function. In this review we survey the literature critically and conclude that in patients with essential hypertension and in patients with chronic renal insufficiency, calcium antagonists effectively reduce systemic blood pressure while maintaining glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow. Preliminary results from a few long-term studies suggest that calcium antagonists may even attenuate the decline in renal function of patients with chronic renal failure. The majority of studies in humans, however, have been nonrandomized, of too short duration, or confounded by investigative difficulties precluding definite conclusions whether calcium antagonists have renoprotective effects. Although the possibility that calcium antagonists may retard progression of renal disease remains to be ascertained, the available evidence indicates that calcium antagonists may be used in patients with renal functional impairment without further exacerbating renal function.",E,E

Hypertension was treated with oral labetolol in combination with guanfacine if necessary. Antihypertensive medication was prescribed significantly more often (16 vs 7 patients; p < 0.05) in the placebo group. Standing systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the isradipine group. The standing diastolic and both systolic and diastolic sitting blood pressures were similar in both groups. After 3 months, patients' mean serum creatinine was significantly lower with isradipine than with placebo (142.0 +/- 11.9 vs 164.0 +/- 10.8 mumol/l; p < 0.05). With isradipine, a significantly higher dose of CyA was needed to achieve adequate plasma levels (8.0 +/- 0.5 vs 6.2 +/- 0.5 mg/kg/day; p < 0.01). It can be concluded that isradipine is an effective antihypertensive agent after kidney transplantation and may have an influence on CyA metabolism. Furthermore, isradipine appears to ameliorate CyA-induced nephropathy.",E,E

Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was reduced to 60-65 mmHg in all patients using a continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) 0.01%. Propofol produced a significant (17%) reduction in the MAP before institution of SNP infusion. This was related to a 24% reduction in the systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI). In the halothane group SVRI was significantly reduced during SNP infusion. Halothane anaesthesia was associated with significant reflex tachycardia in response to SNP induced hypotension. Eight patients in the halothane group (66%) required propranolol 0.5-3 mg to control tachycardia. Propofol anaesthesia attenuated significantly the reflex tachycardia in response to SNP induced hypotension.

Drugs were administered at the same time of day following a randomized, double-blind protocol. Mean resting blood pressure (+/- SE) was 135 +/- 3 mm Hg with placebo administration, 118 +/- 4 with captopril, 110 +/- 4 with nifedipine, and 115 +/- 5 with propranolol and increased with exercise to 163 +/- 4, 146 +/- 3, 136 +/- 4, 136 +/- 4, respectively. Oxygen consumption at peak exercise and at ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) was 25.2 +/- 1.1 and 18.1 +/- 1.0 ml/min/kg with placebo. Only propranolol (-2.3 ml/min/kg) decreased peak exercise oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption at VAT was reduced by nifedipine and propranolol but unaffected by captopril. The effects on exercise capacity of blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients are dependent on the drug utilized and are not related to the amount of blood pressure reduction. The lowered oxygen consumption at VAT observed with nifedipine and propranolol, and not with captopril, might be due to an excessive downward shift of the muscle perfusion pressure--oxygen consumption relationship which might take place during exercise.",E,E

Bisoprolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker, was used in a dose of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg. HCTZ was used at a dose of 6.25 mg. This low-dose compound was developed to minimize dose-related adverse effects. The addition of HCTZ to each of the doses of bisoprolol was compared with monotherapy and placebo. Results of both studies demonstrated that this once-a-day, low-dose option effectively reduced sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure measured at the end of the 24-hour dosing period. Drug-related adverse effects, including those generally associated with traditional beta-blocker therapy, were infrequent in individuals who received the low-dose bisoprolol/HCTZ regimen. Dose-related side effects were minimized because of the low doses of the two agents used together. There were no significant changes in mean total cholesterol, triglycerides, or serum glucose with bisoprolol/HCTZ 6.25 mg therapy versus placebo (analysis of variance statistical methods). The incidence of treatment-induced hypokalemia with bisoprolol/HCTZ 6.25 mg was not significant; uric acid elevations were minimized, and the incidence of hyperuricemia was significantly (P < 0.01) less with bisoprolol/HCTZ 6.25 mg than with 25 mg of HCTZ.

This study compared the antianginal efficacy of nifedipine GITS with a once-a-day beta-receptor blocker, atenolol. Seventeen patients with documented coronary artery disease and stable stress-induced angina pectoris were studied during a 2-week, single-blind, placebo baseline phase and a 12-week randomized, double-blind, active drug crossover efficacy phase, using the bicycle exercise test and ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings. Patients exercised significantly longer with nifedipine GITS (883 +/- 47 seconds) and atenolol (908 +/- 44 seconds) than with placebo (794 +/- 41 seconds). Nifedipine GITS reduced systolic blood pressure at all stages of exercise compared with placebo but, because heart rate tended to increase more during nifedipine therapy, there was no difference in rate-pressure products between the placebo and nifedipine GITS periods. In contrast, atenolol reduced heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product during exercise compared with placebo. Whereas left ventricular ejection fractions (by radionuclide angiocardiography) increased with exercise, the maximal increase was smaller with atenolol than with placebo and nifedipine. The net increase in left ventricular ejection fraction at the end of exercise was greater with nifedipine than with placebo or atenolol. Ambulatory electrocardiograms showed only a small number of ischemic events. Neither nifedipine GITS nor atenolol reduced the number of ischemic events or total duration of ST-segment deviations significantly. It is concluded that nifedipine GITS is as effective an antianginal agent as atenolol, but the hemodynamic effects of the 2 agents differ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",I,E

Nine were women and 5 were men (mean age 33 +/- 13 years). The resting electrocardiogram showed ventricular preexcitation in 8 patients and normal PR interval in 6. Anterograde and retrograde mapping studies revealed that the accessory pathway was para-Hisian in 11 patients and paranodal in 3. The accessory pathway was successfully ablated in 10 patients (9 para-Hisian and 1 paranodal) and damaged in 1 (para-Hisian). Treatment of 3 patients was complicated by transient atrioventricular (AV) block, of 1 by intermittent second-degree AV block, and of another by permanent complete AV block requiring implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Six patients underwent a follow-up electrophysiologic study 84 +/- 55 days after ablation; none had induction of tachycardia even after isoproterenol infusion. It is concluded that radiofrequency ablation therapy for intermediate septal accessory pathway is feasible.

Among 239 patients admitted for acute variceal bleeding, 85 with cirrhosis were randomized to receive sclerotherapy either alone (40) or in combination with propranolol (45). Sclerotherapy was carried out with an intravariceal injection of 5% ethanolamine oleate through a fiberoptic endoscope. The procedure was performed every week, until the esophageal varices at the gastroesophageal junction were too small for any further injections. Varices were reinjected if they recurred. Propranolol was given orally twice a day until heart rate was reduced by 25% in the resting position. The mean follow-up period was 23.2 and 24.2 months for sclerotherapy and the sclerotherapy plus propranolol groups, respectively. During this period a significant (P = 0.001) reduction in the recurrence of esophageal varices was observed in patients treated with the combination of sclerotherapy plus propranolol compared with those treated with sclerotherapy alone. However, the time of rebleeding from any source or from esophageal varices did not differ significantly between the two groups. In the sclerotherapy group 21 patients rebled (35 bleeding episodes) compared with 14 (22 episodes) in the combination therapy group. Patients in the sclerotherapy group were more prone to bleed from gastric varices and congestive gastropathy than patients treated with the combination of sclerotherapy plus propranolol (P = 0.012). Twenty-five patients in the endoscopic sclerotherapy group developed complications attributed to sclerotherapy compared with 23 patients in the sclerotherapy plus propranolol group. Complications directly attributable to propranolol were observed in 11 patients. Three of these patients stopped taking the drug due to heart failure (1) and flapping tremor (2). Eight patients (17.8%) died in the latter group while the corresponding figure in the sclerotherapy group was nine (22.5%).

Ten patients on placebo and 1 receiving the active drug died. Life table analysis showed a significantly better survival in the group of patients treated with propranolol. It is concluded that propranolol decreases the recurrence of variceal bleeding and improves survival in patients with hepatic cirrhosis.",1,E

White women between 60 and 80 years old with sitting diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) from 95 through 114 mm Hg treated with placebo were evaluated by history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and quality-of-life interview. After double-blind randomization with low-dose atenolol, enalapril, or isradipine, the dose was increased stepwise and hydrochlorothiazide added as needed to achieve goal DBP (less than 90 mm Hg and greater than 10 mm Hg below baseline). During maintenance, patients not at goal were ""stepped up,"" and patients with uncontrolled DBP at maximum dosage were removed from the study. The pretreatment (baseline) blood pressure of the 315 randomized participants averaged 161/100 mm Hg; 92% had been treated previously for hypertension, 15% had diabetes mellitus, 11% smoked, and 38% consumed alcohol.; For 245 patients completing the trial, the average decrease in blood pressure during treatment was 18.2/15.6 mm Hg. Antihypertensive efficacy was similar for the monotherapy drug regimens, with 84%, 71%, and 80% of patients receiving atenolol, enalapril, and isradipine, respectively, achieving DBP goal. Of the 70 patients who did not complete the trial, 42 left because of symptoms and 19 because of uncontrolled DBP. No important, unexpected drug-induced changes in symptoms or blood chemistries were noted. Symptom frequency differed little among the three dosage levels, becoming maximal by the second visit at the same dosage level.; All three drugs lowered DBP comparably, and none produced alarming effects.

At 16 weeks of age there was no significant difference in the blood pressures of F1 animals derived from the two crosses. Similarly, in the F2 generation there was no significant difference in either indirect blood pressures measured at 12, 16, or 20 weeks of age or in direct systolic and diastolic blood pressures measured at 25 weeks of age between animals derived from the two crosses maintained on a normal salt diet.

This was a randomised, open-label, controlled, parallel-group comparative study, followed by another 3-month period during which all patients received the combination nifedipine SR-urapidil independently of the treatment they were previously randomized to. Both treatments caused significant falls in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) when compared with the nifedipine SR monotherapy phase. The addition of urapidil to nifedipine SR caused a significant blood pressure reduction of 16.6/13.6 mmHg (p < 0.001), whereas after metoprolol the decrease was of 15.1/14 mmHg (p < 0.001). While in the overall population there was no statistically significant difference between the reduction caused by the two antihypertensive agents added to nifedipine SR, significant differences (DBP, p < 0.05; SBP, p < 0.01) were observed in the group of 51 patients aged at least 60 years. Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were significantly reduced (p < 0.001) after the addition of urapidil to nifedipine SR, while, on the contrary, the addition of metoprolol to nifedipine SR was followed by a significant rise (p = 0.001). The changes caused by the two agents were statistically different among them (p < 0.01). The non-atherogenic HDL-cholesterol did not change during the addition of urapidil or metoprolol to nifedipine SR, while, the HDL/total cholesterol ratio was significantly increased after the addition of urapidil (p < 0.01) and unmodified after the addition of metoprolol. Between-group analysis showed a significant difference (p = 0.005). Serum triglycerides did not change in the urapidil plus nifedipine SR group but significantly increased in the metoprolol plus nifedipine SR group (p < 0.001); between-group difference was not statistically significant. Plasma glucose was unchanged after the addition of urapidil whereas it was significantly (p < 0.001) increased in the metoprolol-added group with a between-group difference statistically significant (p < 0.05). When metoprolol was substituted by urapidil during the second 3-month period, the negative effects on glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were abolished while in the group already treated with urapidil plus nifedipine SR the favourable effects of urapidil plus nifedipine SR on total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and HDL/total cholesterol ratio were significantly increased compared with the end of the first 3-month treatment. The results of this study show that when urapidil and metoprolol are added to non-responders to nifedipine SR therapy there is a clinically and statistically relevant blood pressure reduction with both agents, with a therapeutic advantage for the combination urapidil + nifedipine SR in patients more than 60 years old. Moreover, the addition of urapidil was associated with a more favourable effect on serum lipids and glucose than that produced by the addition of metoprolol.",E,E

All three treatment regimens were given to each patient in randomised order for 4 weeks after a 4 week placebo run-in period. Felodipine 10-20 mg daily, metoprolol 100-200 mg daily and the combination of felodipine 10-20 mg plus metoprolol 100 mg daily were all effective antihypertensive treatments both at rest and during exercise.

Maximal exercise capacity was similar irrespective of treatment regimen, and the normal response to exercise BP and HR was maintained during all active treatments. Changes observed in volume regulatory hormones (PRA, aldosterone and ANP) were consistent with a direct tubular natriuretic-diuretic effect of felodipine and of beta-blocker attenuated release of renin.

A possible explanation for the reduced exercise tolerance is a diminished availability of plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) for energy production during exercise. This study investigated the effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on NEFA uptake of exercising skeletal muscle at elevated blood NEFA concentrations. In 11 healthy volunteers a triacylglycerol emulsion was infused at increasing rate for 1 hour before and 1 hour during one-armed cranking exercise at 60% Wpeak with and without prior administration of the beta 1+2-adrenoceptor blocking agent propranolol (80 mg per os). Arteriovenous concentration differences of NEFA across the active forearm were measured and forearm blood flow was estimated using venous occlusion plethysmography. Heart rate and blood flow were significantly lower after propranolol (p < 0.05). Propranolol did not affect arterial NEFA concentration, arteriovenous NEFA difference or NEFA flux significantly. Net NEFA uptake increased with increasing arterial NEFA concentration or inflow in a similar manner with and without prior propranolol administration. Therefore, the results do not support the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic activity plays a role in the regulation of active skeletal muscle NEFA uptake under the conditions studied.",E,E

Eight poorly controlled type 2 diabetic patients (age, 58 +/- 6 yr; body mass index, 30.0 +/- 5.2 kg/m2; hemoglobin A1c, 10.5 +/- 1.2%) were studied in the fasting state (plasma glucose, 11.1 +/- 1.1 mmol/L). A liquid meal of 400 mL containing 8% amino acids and 50 g sucrose (327 Kcal) was administered at time zero by a nasogastric tube. Gastric volume was determined by a dye dilution technique using phenol red. In randomized order, GLP-1-(7-36) amide (1.2 pmol/kg.min; Saxon Biochemicals) or placebo (0.9% NaCl with 1% human serum albumin) was infused between -30 and 240 min. In the control experiment, gastric emptying was completed within 120 min, and plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1-(7-36) amide, and glucagon concentrations transiently increased. With exogenous GLP-1-(7-36) amide (plasma level, approximately 70 pmol/L), gastric volume remained constant over the period it was measured (120 min; P < 0.0001 vs. placebo), and plasma glucose fell to normal fasting values (5.4 +/- 0.7 mmol/L) within 3-4 h, whereas insulin was stimulated in most, but not all, patients, and glucagon remained at the basal level or was slightly suppressed. In conclusion, GLP-1-(7-36) amide inhibits gastric emptying in type 2 diabetic patients. Together with the stimulation of insulin and the inhibition of glucagon secretion, this effect probably contributes to the blood glucose-lowering action of GLP-1-(7-36) amide in type 2-diabetic patients when studied after meal ingestion. At the degree observed, inhibition of gastric emptying, however, must be overcome by tachyphylaxis, reduction in dose, or pharmacological interventions so as not to interfere with the therapeutic use of GLP-1-(7-36) amide in type 2 diabetic patients.",E,E

After initial diet therapy, 4209 asymptomatic patients who remained hyperglycemic (fasting plasma glucose levels, 6.0 to 15.0 mmol/L) were assigned to either a conventional therapy policy, primarily with diet alone, or to an intensive therapy policy, aiming for fasting plasma glucose levels of less than 6.0 mmol/L, with assignment to primary therapy with sulfonylurea or insulin (which increased insulin supply) or metformin (which enhanced insulin sensitivity).; All three modes of pharmacologic therapy in the intensively treated group-sulfonylurea, insulin, and metformin-had similar efficacy in reducing the fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. Over 9 years, patients assigned to intensive therapy with sulfonylurea or insulin had lower fasting plasma glucose levels (median, 7.3 and 9.0 mmol/L, respectively) than patients assigned to conventional therapy. Regardless of the assigned therapy, however, the fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels increased, and maintaining near-normal glycemia was, in general, not feasible. Even insulin therapy did not achieve the therapeutic goal of near-normal glycemia because of the difficulty in treating marked hyperglycemia and the risk for hypoglycemic episodes.

This study confirms both the advantages of vasodilating beta blockers over metoprolol for initial treatment of heart failure and the usefulness of ANF and BNF measurements for the assessment of drug effects in heart failure compared to traditional haemodynamic measurements.",E,E

Celiprolol and atenolol lead to a similar and significant reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.005). However, with celiprolol heart rate at rest was significantly less depressed then with atenolol (p = 0.004) and showed a distinctly less pronounced depression of heart rate with exercise (p = 0.004). Cardiac output at rest was reduced by 19% under atenolol, but was increased by 9% under celiprolol treatment; in this respect, the two medications differed significantly (p = 0.03). The adaptation of heart rate and cardiac output to exercise was better with celipropol as compared to atenolol treatment. The difference between arm arterial pressure and ankle occlusion pressure at rest was not significantly influenced by atenolol, whereas celiprolol treatment increased this difference by a mean of up to 16 mmHg (p = 0.009). This different effect on peripheral arterial circulation was even more pronounced after exercise. Both celiprolol and atenolol increased blood cell flow velocity in the nailfold capillaries, but this increases was statistically only significant with celiprolol (p = 0.047). These results demonstrate that the hemodynamic effects of celiprolol were significantly different from those of atenolol; celiprolol produces less bradycardia, increases cardiac output at rest and decreases peripheral arterial resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1,E

An evaluation of its pharmacological properties and clinical efficacy in the management of hypertension and angina pectoris.,"Administration, Oral; Angina Pectoris; Antihypertensive Agents; Celiprolol; Humans; Hypertension; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vasodilator Agents","Dunn, C J; Spencer, C M","Celiprolol is a beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker) which acts as a weak agonist at beta 2-adrenoceptors. The drug demonstrates vasodilator properties and does not depress heart rate to the same extent as propranolol, atenolol or metoprolol. Celiprolol has shown equivalent antihypertensive efficacy to other beta-blockers, notably propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol and pindolol, in patients aged 18 to 75 years with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The drug has also shown similar antihypertensive efficacy to the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and to combination diuretic therapy with hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride. Celiprolol was equally effective in adult patients of all ages, although no data are available for patients aged over 75 years. Data from a small number of clinical trials indicate celiprolol to be as effective as both propranolol and atenolol in improving work capacity and reducing the frequency of anginal attacks in patients with stable effort angina. However, the drug has not yet been evaluated in postmyocardial infarction patients. Celiprolol offers advantages over other beta-blockers, including reduction of peripheral vascular resistance and maintenance of resting heart rate, cardiac output and renal perfusion. The drug is also associated with improvements in plasma lipid profiles and does not appear to adversely affect carbohydrate metabolism or lung function, although its use in patients with reversible obstructive pulmonary disease is not recommended. Celiprolol is therefore a highly cardioselective beta-blocker with ancillary characteristics which are potentially useful in patients with hypertension and angina complicated by other conditions commonly associated with advanced age. These include impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease and hyperlipidaemia. The drug may also be preferred to other beta-blockers in patients in whom a reduction in heart rate would be particularly undesirable. Further long term (> 12 months) clinical trials and pharmacoeconomic data are now required to confirm the clinical relevance of the pharmacodynamic advantages of celiprolol therapy.",E,E

In order to tailor drug treatment to the requirements of individual patients more precisely, an ever-increasing number of drugs is being investigated.; Double-blind cross-over study.; Sixteen cirrhotic patients with large oesophageal varices were studied by means of duplex-Doppler ultrasonography to determine variations in portal haemodynamics after oral administration of 0.150 mg clonidine and to compare these with the variations observed after oral administration of 40 mg propranolol.; Propranolol caused a significant reduction in maximum portal flow velocity (P < 0.001), whereas clonidine failed to cause any such variation (P = 0.194). Considering as responders those patients who exhibited at least a 10% decrease in maximum portal flow velocity, 11 patients responded to propranolol; of these, three also responded to clonidine.

Previous antihypertensive drugs were discontinued for at least 2 weeks, after which patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. 25 subjects were treated with perindopril 4 to 8 mg once daily in the morning (Group A) and 22 subjects with metoprolol 25 to 62.5 mg twice daily (Group B). The subjects were evaluated before and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment by use of echocardiography. Before treatment LV mass indexes (LVMI) of two groups were respectively 143.2 +/- 21.3 g/m2 and 140.6 +/- 23.7 g/m2 (P > 0.05). In Group A, reduction of LVMI occurred after 4 weeks of treatment, and more pronounced after 8 weeks (from 143.2 +/- 21.3 g/m2 to 126.6 +/- 15.3 g/m2, P < 0.001), whereas reduction of LVMI occurred only after 8 weeks in Group B (from 140.6 +/- 23.7 g/m2 to 133.4 +/- 13.2 g/m2, P < 0.001). In addition, there was a significant (P < 0.05) difference in LVMI between the two groups after 8 weeks. LV systolic function remained unchanged, whereas E/A increased significantly (P < 0.001) in two groups after 8 weeks. In conclusion, antihypertensive treatment with perindopril and metoprolol induced a significant regression of LVH associated with improvement in LV diastolic performance.

To determine this, we measured plasma endothelin-1 in addition to functional, hemodynamic, and other neurohormonal parameters as part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the beta-blocker vasodilator carvedilol in patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure. Patients were assigned (2:1 randomization) to receive carvedilol (25 mg twice daily, n = 10) or placebo (n = 5) for 14 weeks, with evaluations made before and after therapy. Compared to patients receiving placebo, patients receiving carvedilol improved significantly as assessed by the parameters described. These changes were paralleled by significant falls in endothelin-1 with carvedilol (-2.1 + 3.8 pg/ml) in comparison to placebo (2.2 + 3.9 pg/ml; p < 0.05 for between-group differences). Changes in endothelin-1 after treatment in both groups correlated significantly with changes in symptom severity, New York Heart Association class, 6-minute walk distance (r = 0.64 to 0.80; p < 0.05), hemodynamic parameters (ejection fraction, right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, right atrial pressure, and stroke volume index; r = 0.54 to 0.86; p < 0.05), and neurohormonal parameters (serum aldosterone and plasma norepinephrine (r = 0.74 to 0.76; p < 0.05). By stepwise regression analysis, change in endothelin-1 was an independent, noninvasive predictor of functional and hemodynamic responses to therapy in these patients. These findings suggest that endothelin-1 accurately reflects functional, hemodynamic, and neurohormonal responses to beta-blocker therapy in patients with congestive heart failure. Measurement of endothelin-1 may therefore be a useful, noninvasive approach to the evaluation of clinical response to drug therapy in these patients.",E,E

We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial of metoprolol, a selective beta-blocker for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding from portal hypertension in 29 non-selected patients with liver disease and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. Fifteen patients received placebo treatment for 40 +/- 18 months and 14 patients received metoprolol for 31 +/- 17 months. A sustained reduction in resting pulse was observed in those patients treated with metoprolol. There was no significant difference in acute re-bleeding episodes between the two groups. Of the 14 patients treated with metoprolol, three (21%) re-bled, all three requiring blood transfusion. Four (26.5%) of the 15 patients treated with the placebo re-bled, two cases with acute bleeding and the remaining two cases presented a positive stool guaiac test. All cases who bled during the metoprolol therapy required exclusion from the trial, and surgical procedures or sclerotherapy as well. After both metoprolol or placebo treatments, similar deterioration of standard liver function tests was observed. Further, at the end of the trial, 11 patients on metoprolol (78%) and four of the patients treated with the placebo (27%) required treatment for clinical portal-systemic encephalopathy (p < 0.01). The risk of poor sympathomimetic response after cardioselective beta 1-blocker during acute bleeding episodes and the appearance of hepatic encephalopathy deserve further investigation. The selective beta-blocker metoprolol seems to be an inadequate choice to prevent gastrointestinal re-bleeding in patients with portal hypertension.",E,E

We compared the efficacy of sustained-release (SR) verapamil and metoprolol in reducing silent ischemia in patients with unstable angina and assessed whether detection of silent ischemia was related to unfavorable outcomes in the contemporary setting of concurrent therapy with heparin and aspirin. Holter monitoring (leads a VF, V2, V5) for the first 72 h was used to assess the frequency and duration of ST-shift episodes. There were 37 patients in the verapamil-SR group and 40 patients in the metoprolol group, with both groups having similar baseline characteristics. There were more episodes of angina in the verampamil-SR group (29 vs. 12, p = 0.05). There was no difference between the two groups in the frequency (51 vs. 49 episodes, p = 0.9) or duration (23 +/- 48 vs. 18 +/- 50 min, p = 0.6) of ST-shift episodes. There were 20 unfavorable in-hospital outcomes distributed equally between the two groups (p = 0.9).

Patients with stable coronary artery disease and normal volunteers were used as controls. Sixty patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction (aged 32 to 74 years [mean 56.7]) were randomized to quinapril (n = 25), metoprolol (n = 25), and placebo (n = 10). HRV was assessed 5 days (baseline) and 35 days after the onset of acute myocardial infarction. After the baseline studies, the post-myocardial infarction patients were treated with metoprolol (50 to 100 mg/day), quinapril (5 to 10 mg/day), or placebo. Twenty patients with stable coronary artery disease and 20 healthy volunteers, age- and sex-matched to myocardial infarction patients, were used as controls. Compared with placebo, quinapril and metoprolol increased HRV indexes significantly 35 days after the onset of myocardial infarction. HRV indexes were not statistically different between the 2 treatment groups. At baseline and after therapy, HRV was similar in patients with anterior or inferior wall myocardial infarction. HRV 35 days after the onset of myocardial infarction was not different from HRV in patients with stable coronary artery disease, but was decreased when compared with that in normal volunteers. Data suggest that quinapril has the same beneficial effect on HRV indexes as metoprolol in patients who have recovered from uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction.",I,E

There were significantly greater decreases in the mean systolic blood pressure in both men and women who were assigned to treatment with active drugs compared with those participants who were receiving placebo therapy; differences among treatments with active drugs were similar between men and women. Men experienced larger falls in their total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels regardless of the treatment assignment than did women; however, there were no significant sex-by-treatment interactions. Quality-of-life indexes were generally improved with active drug treatment compared with placebo therapy in both sexes; there was a sex-by-treatment interaction for the general health index.

These observations may parallel the association between reduced heart rate variability during normal activities and adverse outcome. This investigation was designed to look at the prognostic implications of exercise heart rate response in a population-based sample.; In this prospective cohort investigation, 1575 male participants (mean age, 43 years) in the Framingham Offspring Study who were free of coronary heart disease, who were not taking beta-blockers, and who underwent submaximal treadmill exercise testing (Bruce protocol) were studied. Heart rate response was assessed in three ways: (1) failure to achieve 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate, which has been the traditional definition of chronotropic incompetence; (2) the actual increase in heart rate from rest to peak exercise; and (3) the ratio of heart rate to metabolic reserve used by stage 2 of exercise (""chronotropic response index""). Proportional hazards analyses were used to evaluate the associations of heart rate responses with all-cause mortality and with coronary heart disease incidence during 7.7 years of follow-up. Failure to achieve target heart rate occurred in 327 (21%) subjects. During follow-up there were 55 deaths (14 caused by coronary heart disease) and 95 cases of incident coronary heart disease. Failure to achieve target heart rate, a smaller increase in heart rate with exercise, and the chronotropic response index were predictive of total mortality and incident coronary heart disease (P <.01). Failure to achieve target heart rate remained predictive of incident coronary heart disease even after adjusting for age, ST-segment response, physical activity, and traditional coronary disease risk factors (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.74; P=.02). After adjusting for the same factors, the increase in exercise heart rate remained inversely predictive of total mortality (P=.04) and coronary heart disease incidence (P=.0003). The chronotropic response index also was predictive of total mortality (P=.05) and incident coronary heart disease (P=.001) after adjusting for age and other risk factors.; An attenuated heart rate response to exercise, a manifestation of chronotropic incompetence, is predictive of increased mortality and coronary heart disease incidence.",E,E

HRV has been shown to be reduced in heart failure. Preliminary data indicate that beta blockers improve clinical status in patients with heart failure, but HRV improvement remains to be demonstrated. Fifty-four patients from the randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study were included in the HRV study. The bisoprolol daily dose was 5 mg once daily. We assessed HRV during 24-hour Holter recordings before randomization and after 2 months of treatment. HRV as measured in the time domain by root-mean-square successive differences (rMSSD), the percentage of adjacent RR differences >50 ms (pNN50), and the SD of RR intervals (SDNN), and in the frequency domain by high-frequency (0.16 to 0.40 Hz) and low-frequency (0.04 to 0.15 Hz) power. Most patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 27 +/- 7%, and heart failure was idiopathic or ischemic. After 2 months, the patients receiving bisoprolol had a reduced mean heart rate compared with that in placebo patients (p=0.0004). Bisoprolol increased 24-hour rMSSD (p=0.04) and 24-hour pNN50 (p=0.04), daytime SDNN (p=0.05), and daytime high-frequency power (p=0.03) power. Bisoprolol induced a significant increase in HRV parameters related to parasympathetic activity in heart failure.

This finding led the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to recommend termination of the study before its scheduled completion. In addition, as compared with placebo, carvedilol therapy was accompanied by a 27 percent reduction in the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (19.6 percent vs. 14.1 percent, P = 0.036), as well as a 38 percent reduction in the combined risk of hospitalization or death (24.6 percent vs, 15.8 percent, P < 0.001). Worsening heart failure as an adverse reaction during treatment was less frequent in the carvedilol than in the placebo group.; Carvedilol reduces the risk or death as well as the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes in patients with heart failure who are receiving treatment with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor.",I,8

Ninety patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were randomized to a hemodilution (n = 60) and a control group (n = 30). During midazolam-fentanyl anesthesia, hemodynamic variables, ST segment deviation, and O2 consumption were determined prior to and after 6 and 12 mL/kg isovolemic exchange of blood for 6% hydroxyethyl starch. Hemoglobin decreased from 12.6 +/- 0.2 to 9.9 +/- 0.2 g/dL (mean +/- SEM, P < 0.05). With stable filling pressures, cardiac index increased from 2.05 +/- 0.05 to 2.27 +/- 0.05 L.min-1.m-2(P < 0.05) and O2 extraction from 27.4% +/- 0.6% to 31.2% +/- 0.7% (P < 0.05), resulting in stable O2 consumption.

Individual increases in cardiac index and O2 extraction were not linearly related to age and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (P = 0.841, P = 0.799). We conclude that isovolemic hemodilution to a hemoglobin value of 9.9 +/- 0.2 g/dL is well tolerated and fully compensated in patients with coronary artery disease receiving beta-adrenergic blockers chronically. Within the investigated ranges, the compensatory mechanisms during hemodilution are largely independent of age (35-81 yr) and LV ejection fraction (26%-83%).",E,E

VP was assessed using a noninvasive endoscopic gauge. Spironolactone was administered during a 6-week period at a dosage of 100 mg/d. This treatment decreased VP from 16.8 +/- 1.9 (SD) to 14.1 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (P < .001) in a group of 12 patients and from 18.6 +/- 2.1 to 13.7 +/- 4.1 mm Hg (P < .01) in another group of 8 patients who still had high VP despite chronic intake of propranolol. In both groups, placebo administration to 12 and 8 comparable patients did not significantly alter VP. Spironolactone induced a significant reduction of plasma volume (42.1 +/- 5.5 to 36.1 +/- 6.6 mL/kg body weight, P < .01) and of the concentration of alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-ANP) (39.8 +/- 22 to 27.7 +/- 20 pg/mL, P < .01); in addition, a pronounced increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) (1.1 +/- 0.9 to 7.5 +/- 3.4 ng/mL/h, P < .001) was induced by the treatment. No significant changes in systemic hemodynamics were observed during the studies. Severe side effects were not observed except for a high incidence (55%) of painful gynecomasty in the male patients. In conclusion, chronic spironolactone administration effectively lowers VP, even in patients under chronic propranolol therapy. The combination of propranolol and spironolactone deserves further study as a prophylactic therapy of variceal hemorrhage, but development of gynecomasty might be a problem. Finally, we confirmed the reproducibility of VP measurements with the noninvasive gauge in chronic conditions.",E,E

Clinicians, however, engage in a process of clinical inquiry, assembling data that will allow an assessment of the appropriate choice of treatment according to more narrowly defined clinical features. We describe a method of clinical inquiry within RCTs that can enhance the applicability of results to clinical decision making. Our methods included the use of data from the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, which enrolled 3837 subjects in 31 clinical centers. The 31 centers were divided into 21 dominant centers (mortality rates higher for placebo than propranolol) and 10 divergent centers (higher mortality rates for patients randomized to propranolol). Overall, compared to placebo, propranolol reduced the risk of dying for the ""average"" patient from 9.8 to 7.2%. Results for patients in dominant centers (RR = 0.50) were significantly different from those in divergent centers (RR = 1.33). We identified two cotherapies--aspirin use and coronary artery surgery--that subsequently affected the benefits of propranolol in divergent centers. For patients in divergent centers, propranolol reduced the risk of dying for patients treated with aspirin and/or coronary surgery (RR = 0.39), but not for patients not receiving these therapies (RR = 1.42). We conclude that differences in results across centers of a multicenter RCT may reflect important distinctions in the clinical conditions of enrolled subjects. These distinctions help to identify subgroups of patients in which treatment that has an average overall benefit may be harmful for some patients.",E,E

Reduction of left ventricular mass index after antihypertensive therapy with placebos, diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was the principal parameter.; Of 471 identified references describing the effects of antihypertensive drugs on left ventricular hypertrophy, only 39 clinical trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria of our study. We found that the decrease in left ventricular mass index was more marked the greater was the decline in blood pressure (systolic r=0.46, P<.001; diastolic r=0.21, P=.08) and the longer was the duration of therapy (r=0.38, P<.01). After adjustment for different durations of treatment (mean duration of treatment, 25 weeks), left ventricular mass decreased 13% with ACE inhibitors, 9% with calcium channel blockers, 6% with beta-blockers, and 7% with diuretics. There was a significant difference between drug classes (P<.01): ACE inhibitors reduced left ventricular mass more than beta-blockers (significant, P<.05) and diuretics (tendency, P=.08). Similar differences between drug classes were found with regard to effect on left ventricular wall thickness (P<.05).; The database of articles published through July 1995 is small and incomplete, and most of the articles are of poor scientific quality. In this first meta-analysis including only double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical studies, decline in blood pressure, duration of drug treatment, and drug class determined the reductions in left ventricular mass index. The ACE inhibitors seemed to be more potent than beta-blockers and diuretics in the reduction of left ventricular mass index; calcium channel blockers were somewhat in the intermediate range. The ACE inhibitors and, to a lesser extent, calcium channel blockers emerged as first-line candidates to reduce the risk associated with left ventricular hypertrophy.",E,E

The first study compared electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmic drug therapy with nonguided beta-blocker therapy. Patients without inducible arrhythmias were assigned to oral metoprolol; patients with inducible arrhythmias were randomly assigned to receive either oral metoprolol or EP-guided drug therapy with propafenone, flecainide, disopyramide, sotalol, or amiodarone. Antiarrhythmic drugs were tested in a random order, but amiodarone was always tested last. A total of 170 patients were evaluated; 115 patients had inducible arrhythmias, and 61 patients were randomly assigned to serial drug testing, 54 to metoprolol without invasive testing, and the remainder who were noninducible to empiric metoprolol. The best outcome was observed in patients without inducible arrhythmias, all of whom received metoprolol. There was no difference in outcome between the two groups with inducible arrhythmias, either treated with metoprolol or with EP-guided serial antiarrhythmic drug testing. The second study evaluated survivors of out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) without new myocardial infarction. Patients received assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction, Holter monitoring (HM), and EP testing. Only patients with inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias or with sufficient ambulatory ventricular ectopy were included in the study. Therapy was randomized either to empiric amiodarone or conventional drug therapy guided by EP testing and/or HM. A total of 228 patients were treated, 113 with amiodarone and 115 with conventional antiarrhythmic drug therapy. The composite primary end points were total mortality, documented out-of-hospital resuscitation from recurrent VF, or syncopal implantable cardioverter/defibrillator shock followed by return of consciousness. Patients treated with empiric amiodarone had a better outcome than did patients treated with guided conventional drug therapy. In those patients in whom an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was used, patients treated with amiodarone had fewer total shocks and fewer syncopal shocks than did patients treated with conventional therapy. Patients with a history of out-of-hospital VF or sustained ventricular tachycardia without inducible ventricular arrhythmias at EP study have the best outcome. Empiric metoprolol is equivalent to conventional antiarrhythmic drug therapy guided by EP testing. Empiric amiodarone is superior to conventional antiarrhythmic drug therapy guided by HM and/or EP testing.",I,E

Many results, such as the overall 28-day fatality rates of 49.8% in men and 48.5% in women, showed insignificant differences. However, 74.3% of deaths in men occurred out of hospital versus 67.8% in women (P = .0004). After admission to hospital, fatality rates in women were 14% higher (P = .07) and after admission to coronary care, 22% higher (P = .04). Women were more often widowed. Fewer had a history of previous myocardial infarction, but the prevalence of angina pectoris, of smoking, and of chest pain in the attack was the same as in men; more had shock, syncope, and breathlessness. More consulted a doctor before admission to hospital, which delayed their coming under care. More men had ECG Q-wave progression, and more women had smaller ECG changes. This, and marginally reduced chances of direct admission to coronary care, of thrombolysis, of aspirin, and of beta-blockers, did not explain women's excess hospital fatality.; Acute coronary events appear to be recognized and treated fairly equally in men and women 25 to 64 years old in Glasgow, so differences are small but subtle. More men die suddenly out of hospital; the reason why more women die after arrival may be because the equivalent number of men have already died outside.",E,E

The aim of this work was to study in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design the effect on blood pressure of the addition of either a thiazide diuretic (bendrofluazide, 5 mg once daily) or a beta-blocker (atenolol, 100 mg once daily) or placebo each for a month in hypertensive patients who are not adequately controlled on the combined treatment of amlodipine 5 mg once daily and lisinopril 5 mg twice daily. Eighteen patients with a supine diastolic pressure of more than 90 mm Hg after at least 1 month on the combined treatment of amlodipine and lisinopril were enrolled in the study. The results show that in patients whose blood pressures are not controlled by the combination of amlodipine and lisinopril, the addition of bendrofluazide 5 mg once daily causes a significant fall in blood pressure compared with placebo and a significantly greater fall than 100 mg atenolol once daily.",E,E

Urinary excretion of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha and of 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha, stable breakdown products of prostacyclin, was measured following a 1 month run-in period. To determine whether lowering blood pressure (BP) influenced prostacyclin biosynthesis, 106 consenting patients with diastolic pressure 90-120 mm Hg were allocated randomly to treatment with bendrofluazide, metoprolol, quinapril or amlodipine in an open parallel group design. Dose was increased to reduce diastolic arterial pressure to <90 mm Hg. Terazosin was added if this target BP was not achieved, and its dose increased if necessary. Urinary excretion rates of prostaglandins were measured after 1 year in patients in whom the target diastolic pressure was achieved. Mean arterial pressure varied from 106-168 mm Hg in untreated patients and excretion of both prostacyclin-derived products varied from <5 to >350 ng/g creatinine. Arterial pressure and prostaglandin excretion were not significantly correlated. In 57 patients in whom target pressure was achieved, BP before treatment was 166 +/- 2/100 +/- 1 at baseline and 144 +/- 2/86 +/- 1 mm Hg at 1 year. Excretion rates of each prostacyclin-derived product were similar before treatment and at 1 year, with no significant differences between the drugs.

To understand whether any difference between randomized groups in the intention-to-treat analysis can be explained by such treatment changes, we need analysis strategies which take account of treatment actually received. Selection bias is then a potentially serious problem. We relate risk in a time-dependent proportional hazards model to current treatment, with treatment combinations coded in two alternative ways. To reduce selection bias, treatment history (number of treatments dropped) and baseline covariates can be added to the model. Including current risk markers would also reduce selection bias but makes interpretation difficult. The methods are illustrated using data from the British Medical Research Council (MRC) elderly hypertension trial, with time to cardiovascular death as an outcome. Results for the comparison of diuretic and beta-blocker treatment are similar in all analyses, suggesting that selection bias is small and adding support to the hypothesis that the observed treatment differences are due to the randomized treatments themselves.",E,E

Dyslipidemia is one of the risk factors for the development of coronary atherosclerosis. Recent studies suggest that treating dyslipidemia in persons with coronary atherosclerosis may decrease morbidity and mortality.; A meta-analysis of 33 studies on the clinical and angiographic benefits of treating dyslipidemia in the prevention of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease was performed. These benefits are quantitated in the form of ""number needed to treat"" (NNT) as an estimate of the public health benefit. The NNT is defined as the number of people that need to be treated to prevent one event.; Treatment of dyslipidemia in persons with multiple atherosclerosis risk factors alone, ie, primary prevention, was effective in preventing myocardial infarction and all-cause death. In six trials of primary prevention, excluding the British cooperative trial using clofibrate, the NNT was 53 to prevent a nonfatal MI and 190 to prevent all-cause death (4.8 years treatment with total cholesterol reduction of 15%). Treatment of dyslipidemia in people with known atherosclerosis, ie, secondary and tertiary prevention, was also effective in preventing myocardial infarctions and death from all causes. For 23 trials of secondary and tertiary prevention, the NNT was 37 to prevent death from any cause (4.9 years treatment with total cholesterol reduction of 18%). In the trials with quantitative angiography, the NNT was 7 to prevent progression of coronary atherosclerosis and 10 to induce regression of coronary atherosclerosis (2.5 years treatment with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction of 28%). Similar benefits were observed in those trials employing HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. Benefits may be similar with niacin or dietary therapy, but these therapies did not reach significance in all categories of benefits, potentially due to beta error. These treatment benefits are comparable to other secondary prevention measures such as aspirin or beta blockers. The benefits appeared to extend to persons over 65, with less clearly defined benefits for women.; These results support the overall clinical benefit of treating dyslipidemia, both in persons with and without known atherosclerosis.",E,E

Forty patients (16 women) aged 47 +/- 9 years (mean +/- SD) with baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 162 +/- 15 and 105 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively, were entered into a double-blind, parallel-group study with cilazapril, 5 mg once daily, or atenolol, 100 mg once daily. The treatment period was preceded by a 4-week placebo washout phase. Aortic elastic modulus (Ep) was determined by cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and indirect brachial artery blood pressure measurements prior to and after 3 weeks and 6 months of therapy. The reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures from baseline to 6 months averaged -17 +/- 13 and -10 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively, with cilazapril and -23 +/- 16 and -14 +/- 6 mm Hg with atenolol. Concomitantly, Ep of the ascending aorta decreased with cilazapril from a median of 2,234 10(3)dyn/cm2 (interquartile range, 866-3,740) to 868 10(3)dyn/cm2 (515-1,486) and with atenolol from a median of 1,611 10(3)dyn/cm2 (895-2,790) to 1,054 10(3)dyn/cm2 (616-1,860). In repeated-measurements analysis of variance, the change in Ep with time was statistically significant (p < 0.001) but the group x time interaction was not. We conclude that 6 months of treatment with either cilazapril or atenolol reduces the stiffness of the ascending aorta in essential hypertension. No statistically significant differences between the effects of the two drugs were observed. The mechanisms and clinical significance of improved aortic distensibility with antihypertensive therapy deserve further study.",E,E

The mean leukocyte count was approximately 1000 cells/microL higher among whites than among blacks, and approximately 1900 cells/microL higher among current smokers than among nonsmokers. The leukocyte count was also higher among men who had recently stopped smoking and among men who reported their general health as poor or fair. Independent of these relations, the leukocyte count was associated positively with the platelet count (r = 0.29), triglyceride level (r = 0.21), heart rate (r = 0.15), and use of corticosteroids and beta-blockers; and inversely with alcohol consumption and prothrombin time (r = -0.10). The examined characteristics could together account for 37% of the variability in leukocyte counts. These relatively strong associations indicate that it may be difficult to disentangle the relation of the leukocyte count to IHD from that of other risk factors.",E,E

Sandoretic induced a decrease of the mean sitting initial systolic blood pressure of 162.5 +/- 16.5 mmHg to 134.2 +/- 12.8 mmHg at the end of the study, a decrease of 28.3 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure decreased after 16 weeks of treatment from the initial value of 103.9 +/- 4.9 mmHg to 85.3 +/- 6.0, a decrease of 18.6 mmHg.

Scatterplot dispersion at different R-R intervals provides a measure of beat-to-beat heart-rate variability at different heart rates. A 24-hour Holter tape was performed at baseline and after 2 months of treatment with bisoprolol or matched placebo. Geometric measurements of scatterplots were used to determine beat-to-beat dispersion for different R-R intervals. Bisoprolol and placebo groups were well matched at base-line. After 2 months of treatment, bisoprolol significantly increased beat-to-beat variability at the longest R-R intervals (p < 0.05); however, there was no change in scatterplot dispersion at the shortest R-R intervals.

Three patients (3%) of Group A and 5 (5%) of Group B interrupted therapy for side effects; 5 patients (5.5%) of Group C with supraventricular tachycardia interrupted the double blind therapy; 11 were lost to follow-up.; Of the remaining 276 patients, TAA were observed in 43 (44.8%) of 96 patients in Group A, 28 (29.5%) of 95 patients in Group B and 62 (72.9%) of 85 patients in Group C. TAA were significantly less in A and B groups than in Group C (p < 0.005); a significant TAA reduction was also observed in patients treated with sotalol compared with those treated with propafenone (p < 0.05). TAA were: FA-118 (88.7%) and FIA-15 (11.3%). The arrhythmia free time was significantly shorter in Group C.; Sotalol seems to be more effective than propafenone and therefore represents a valid alternative for FA prevention.",1,E

The combination of dihydropyridines with beta-blocking drugs enhances the effectiveness of both single therapies. Nifedipine, in the usual formulation (AR), is burdened by an unsatisfactory tolerability, and this is the main reason to study new dihydropyridines.; To compare efficacy and tolerability of felodipine ER 10 mg o.d. with that of nifedipine AR 20 mg b.d. in patients with stable angina pectoris refractory to beta-blocker therapy.; Of 15 initial patients, 14 were entirely evaluable for the study, the design of which was double blind, double dummy, random cross over and placebo controlled. All patients showed reproducible threshold of ischemia at exercise testing. In constancy of beta-blocker therapy, they were given placebos for 2 weeks, then one of the active drugs with a placebo of the other one for 4 weeks, followed by the cross-over period of 4 weeks. Efficacy and tolerability of treatments were evaluated by clinical observation and rest and exercise radionuclide angiography. At the end of each individual study, it was decided blindly if and which of the 2 drugs seemed preferable, considering symptoms, undesired collateral effects and the results of exercise procedures.; The efficacy on angina of the 2 active treatments was not different. More patients suffered undesired side effects on nifedipine than on felodipine. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest was 65.3 +/- 4.3% (s.e.) on placebo, 64.6 +/- 2.6% on felodipine and 67.5 +/- 2.5% on nifedipine (p n.s.). A significant reduction in resting LV function (that is, a decrease of LVEF > or = 5%) was observed in 2 patients on felodipine and 3 on nifedipine, but in both groups other 3 patients showed improvement in LVEF. During exercise, LVEF decreased 6.1 +/- 2.0% on placebo and 3.3 +/- 3.2% on nifedipine, while it increased 1.0 +/- 2.6% on felodipine (p < 0.01 vs. placebo). At the end of the study, felodipine was blindly judged superior to nifedipine in 10 patients, nifedipine was superior in 1 case, in the other 3 there was no clear difference (p < 0.02).; In 14 patients with stable angina refractory to beta-blockers, the addition of felodipine or nifedipine has similar antiischemic effects. However, felodipine showed better results in LVEF response to exercise and less side effects, and this leaded to a more frequent blind choice of felodipine versus nifedipine to add to beta-blocker therapy.",E,E

The study of these patterns may yield important clues to the pathophysiology of the disease process. Most studies of the timing of onset of sudden cardiac death have revealed a prominent midmorning peak, thought to be related to a surge in catecholamines associated with arising and assuming the upright posture, that is blunted or eliminated by beta blockers. In addition, some studies have also shown a secondary peak in late afternoon or early evening of uncertain cause.

Sufentanil infusion was titrated to maintain hemodynamic stability, defined as mean arterial pressure within 15% of baseline values. All patients received preoperative beta-blocking agents. Arterial blood samples of midazolam and sufentanil were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay, respectively.; The mean dose of sufentanil (7.5 +/- 1.7 microgram/kg in group 1 v 7.2 +/- 2.5 micrograms/kg in group 2) did not differ. There were no significant differences in hemodynamics between the groups in the period before or after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Before CPB, in two patients in each group, hypertension was controlled with sufentanil only. One patient in group 1 required a vasodilator in addition to sufentanil. No ischemic events occurred before CPB. After CPB, one patient in group 2 required a vasodilator to control hypertension. Two patients in group 2 required treatment with nitroglycerin for myocardial ischemia. Stable plasma concentrations of sufentanil and midazolam were obtained during and after CPB. The midazolam infusion was continued in both groups at a rate of 1.25 micrograms/kg/min during the first 4 postoperative hours. The time to awakening did not differ between the groups (100 +/- 58 minutes in group 1 v 173 +/- 147 minutes in group 2) nor did the plasma concentrations of midazolam (96 +/- 28 ng/mL v 108 +/- 42 ng/mL) at the time of awakening. Intraoperative awareness was not reported.; In patients undergoing CABG, good hemodynamic control with a similar incidence of hemodynamic interventions was observed at midazolam target plasma concentrations of 150 and 300 ng/mL when coadministered with sufentanil. The sufentanil requirement was identical in both groups. This study suggests that a midazolam plasma concentration of 150 ng/mL is sufficient to provide satisfactory hemodynamic control and to avoid intraoperative awareness.",E,E

Using continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound, the aortic blood velocity signals, both at rest and at maximal-tolerated supine exercise, were obtained. From the Doppler signals the peak velocity (Vp), stroke distance (Sd; the velocity-time integral) and minute distance (Md = Sd x heart rate) were calculated. The measurements were repeated 6 weeks after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), performed in 30 patients. No relationship with age (p < 0.01) was found for any of the indices, either at rest or during exercise, except for the resting Md in patients not on beta-blockers, (p < 0.02). No difference in the slope of the relationship with age was found between patients on or not on beta-blockers, except for the resting Md (p < 0.02). Following CABG, a significant age relationship with Vp, Sd and Md was restored, during both resting and exercise, suggesting improvement of systolic left ventricular function following myocardial revascularization. In conclusion, the normal age relationships of the derivatives of aortic blood velocity Doppler ultrasound signals were not seen in patients with coronary artery disease, irrespective of whether they were on or off beta-blockers. The relationship changed following myocardial revascularization, suggesting their dependence on systolic left ventricular function.",E,E

We have studied the influence of salt intake on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (Creatinine Clearance) in 14 patients with mild hypertension. Each patient was studied in random order and according to a crossover design, at habitual salt intake, at high salt intake (ie habitual +50/100 mmol/day) and at low salt intake (habitual -50/100 mmol/day). Protein, calcium and potassium intake was fixed across the three study periods. The control group was formed by seven healthy subjects. High salt intake, caused a significant (P < 0.01) increase in 24 h mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the expected suppression in plasma renin activity (PRA) and in plasma aldosterone. Seven patients were classified as salt-sensitive. The GFR was significantly higher (P < 0.01) at high salt intake (125 +/- 10 ml/min) than at habitual (113 +/- 7 ml/min) and at low salt intake (97 +/- 6 ml/min). On aggregate urinary salt excretion was significantly related with the GFR (P < 0.01 by correlation analysis for repeated observations) and the slope of this relationship predicted that a 100 mmol/day increase in salt intake is associated with the 14.6 ml/min rise in the GFR. The relationship between GFR and 24 h urinary salt in salt sensitive patients did not differ from that in salt resistant patients. The GFR response to salt loading was largely independent of the renin-aldosterone system. No change in arterial pressure nor in GFR was observed in healthy subjects. At fixed protein intake, changes in salt intake in the physiological range are associated with important GFR variations in mild hypertensives. As long as hyperfiltration in mild hypertension is a predictor of renal function deterioration, high salt intake, independent of the effect of arterial pressure, could be a factor that contributes to nephronic obsolescence in patients with essential hypertension.",E,E

After amlodipine the plasma viscosity decreased and the erythrocyte deformability increased in the majority of patients. Plasma fibrinogen decreased after metoprolol treatment. Despite the differences in haemodynamic mechanisms underlying the decrease in BP, amlodipine and metoprolol exert beneficial effects on blood viscosity. Haemodilution and a decrease in serum erythropoietin may be factors underlying this decrease in blood viscosity.",E,E

Decline on the PALT was associated with advanced age, male sex, rural residence, depression and low intelligence. These effects were modified by gender and level of pre-morbid intelligence. Advanced age, rural residence and number of cigarettes smoked daily were only associated with PALT decline among women of below median intelligence. The association between depression and PALT decline was only apparent in women of below median intelligence and men of above median intelligence. While these findings are consistent with other research into cognitive decline, they differ in some ways from reported risk factors for dementia, suggesting aetiological separateness.

Forty-seven patients (21 men, 26 women, average age 54 years) participated in an open controlled clinical trial. After a 4-week washout period, all of the patients received betaxolol monotherapy at a dose of 5-10 mg daily for 6 months (Phase I). From month 7 through month 12 (Phase II), half of the total patients (Group B, n = 23) with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95 mm Hg or more at the end of Phase I were also given nitrendipine (10-20 mg, once daily), while the remaining patients (Group A, n = 24) continued to receive only betaxolol. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), DBP, and heart rate (HR) were monitored once monthly. Serum lipid profiles were measured at study entry and after 6 and 12 months of therapy. Betaxolol significantly reduced SBP, DBP, and HR in both groups during Phase I, and the reductions in SBP and DBP were markedly less in Group B than in Group A. During Phase II, the additional reduction of SBP and DBP to levels similar to those in Group A was achieved by betaxolol in combination with nitrendipine, and HR was slightly but significantly increased. Betaxolol monotherapy reduced serum levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and increased levels of triglyceride, apolipoprotein (apo) C-II and apo C-III. Combination therapy with betaxolol and nitrendipine increased serum apo A-I but did not affect other lipid profiles.

The score was calculated by the formula: (delta R - delta Q - delta S)AVF + (delta R - delta Q - delta S)V5.; Using a cut-off point of > 5 as normal, the QRS score resulted in a sensitivity of 88.2%, a specificity of 84.8% and a predictive accuracy of 87.1%. For ST-segment depression these values were 54.9%, 83% and 64.5% respectively (P < 0.001 compared to the QRS score). Predictive accuracies of changes in Q-, R- and S-waves in leads AVF and V5 separately, combinations of changes and combining the two leads, resulted-with the exception of solitary S-wave changes-in predictive accuracies higher than those of ST-segment depression, but all were lower than the QRS score. We found a significant correlation between the QRS score, the summed ST-segment depression (P < 0.004) and the extent of reversible thallium-201 defects (P < 0.001). Applying Bayes' theorem, the combination of an abnormal QRS score and ST-segment depression resulted in the highest post-test risk for coronary artery disease and a normal QRS score without ST-segment depression in the lowest post-test risk. The QRS score and the maximal ST-segment depression changed significantly under the influence of beta-blockade (P < 0.02 and P < 0.001 respectively).; Our data suggest that an abnormal QRS score reflects myocardial ischaemia. Furthermore, for the interpretation of the exercise test, the combined analysis of ST-segments and the QRS score is of value for the prediction of the presence or absence of coronary artery disease and its follow-up.",E,E

(n = 106) or the beta 1-receptor partial agonist xamoterol 100-200 mg b.i.d. (n = 104). Left ventricular systolic and diastolic function were assessed with echocardiography and transmitral Doppler cardiography before and after 3 and 12 months of double-blind treatment. E-point septal separation and percent left ventricular fractional shortening were used as indices of systolic function. The ratio between peak early and late mitral diastolic flow (E/A ratio) and isovolumic relaxation time were used as indices of diastolic function. In the xamoterol group, there was a deterioration in E-point septal separation (P < 0.05). A difference between the treatment groups was present both at 3 months (E-point septal separation 11.4 vs 13.0 mm, P < 0.01, fractional shortening 27.1 vs 25.2%, P < 0.05) and 12 months (E-point septal separation 11.1 vs 13.2 mm.

The distribution of the standardized differences between the two treatments for each variable was obtained by a permutation method. The medians (estimation of the actual difference between the two treatments) and the 5, 25, 75 and 95% quantiles were represented on the same diagram for all end points. The pattern of the standardized distribution of the differences showed a similar activity of both drugs on symptoms and nitrates consumption, on exercise tolerance and increase in ischemic threshold at exercise, and on ischemia recorded at ambulatory ECG monitoring. Conversely, only propranolol decreased heart rate and rate pressure product at rest as well as at exercise, underlining the difference in the mode of action of the two drugs. This descriptive technique is an attractive method to evaluate the differences between drugs considering multiple criteria favouring the estimation of these differences together with their variability.",I,E

Such a marked decrease is rarely achieved with propranolol, and new agents or combinations of them are now being explored. The present randomized study investigated whether chronic treatment with the combination of propranolol plus molsidomine, a preferential venous dialator that reduces hepatic venous pressure gradient and does not cause pharmacological tolerance, achieves greater reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient than propranolol alone.; A hemodynamic study was performed in 34 patients with cirrhosis with portal hypertension in baseline conditions and after 3 months of chronic oral treatment with propranolol alone (n = 19) or propranolol plus molsidomine (n = 15).; Propranolol produced a significant reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient (-16%, p < 0.01). Propranolol plus molsidomine also caused a slight but significant decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient (-9%, p < 0.05). Hepatic blood flow and the hepatic and intrinsic clearance of indocyanine green were significantly reduced by propranolol. The combined administration of propranolol+molsidomine significantly reduced hepatic blood flow but not hepatic and intrinsic clearance of indocyanine green. Both treatment groups produced similar reduction in azygos blood flow, heart rate and cardiac output. However, contrary to propranolol alone, propranolol plus molsidomine did not increase cardiopulmonary pressures.; The current study shows that although the combined administration of propranolol plus molsidomine prevents some of the adverse effects of propranolol on liver function and cardiopulmonary pressures, it does not achieve a greater reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient than propranolol alone and therefore, does not support the use of this combined therapy for the pharmacological treatment of portal hypertension.",E,E

Therefore, we evaluated whether PGE2 mucosal generation, and gastric potential difference - a reflection of the gastric mucosal barrier - were correlated to endoscopic features and whether these alterations could be alleviated.; The potential difference was measured before (basal) and after a stimulation test by aspirin. The serum levels of gastrin and glucagon were also determined. Finally, the effects of a 1-week administration of propranolol or enprostil were tested on potential difference. The endoscopic grade of portal hypertensive gastropathy was assessed according to McCormack et al. The results are presented respectively for controls, patients with mild gastropathy, and patients with severe gastropathy. Comparisons were made using variance or covariance analysis after adjustment with age.; Basal potential difference was significantly different between the three groups: -30.6, -28.8, -24.9 mV, p <0.05, respectively. The effects of aspirin administration on potential difference parameters were significantly different between the three groups (irritability index: 35 +/- 25, 92 +/- 98, 114 +/- 74 mV2.min, p <0.05, respectively) when non-responders to aspirin were excluded. PGE2 mucosal generation was significantly increased in both the antrum (9.8, 19.5, 19.7 ng/mg proteins, p<0.05, respectively) and in the corpus (8.1, 14.0, 20.2 ng/mg proteins, p<0.05, respectively). PGE2 generation was not related to potential difference. Glucagon serum levels were related to the grade of gastropathy. A 1-week administration of 160 mg/d long-acting propranolol, 35 micro g/d enprostil or placebo did not significantly modify basal potential difference.; Portal hypertensive gastropathy is characterized by a decreased potential difference proportional to the endoscopic severity. The gastric mucosa of patients with cirrhosis seems to be more susceptible to aspirin than that of healthy subjects. It appears that the role of PGE2 is controversial in portal hypertensive gastropathy. Propranolol and enprostil do not improve this decreased potential difference.",E,E

Fifty-two patients completed the 12-month, randomized, multicenter trial. After administration of lisinopril (10 to 20 mg/d; n = 24) and bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg/d; n = 28), systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly (P < 0.01) from baseline in both groups at 3, 6, and 12 months. The reduction in diastolic blood pressure was significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the lisinopril group than in the bisoprolol group only at 6 months. Heart rates dropped significantly in the bisoprolol group but not in the lisinopril group. No significant changes in lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, or Lp(a) levels were observed with either drug at 3, 6, or 12 months, and no significant differences were noted between the two drugs for these parameters. We conclude that lisinopril and bisoprolol are effective as antihypertensive drugs without adverse metabolic effects after short- and long-term treatment in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.",E,E

Of the 545 patients screened, 520 (95.4%) could be followed up. Rates of cardiac and noncardiac death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, hospital admission for unstable angina and need for coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were recorded.; A total of 145 events occurred in 120 (23.1%) of 520 patients. Patients with more than six episodes had an event rate of 32.5% compared with 25.0% for patients with two to six episodes and 13.2% for patients with less than two episodes (p < 0.001). Hard events (death, acute myocardial infarction, hospital admission for unstable angina pectoris) were more frequent in patients with two or more ischemic episodes (12.2% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.0049). Patients with a 100% response rate of transient ischemic episodes during the TIBBS trial had a 17.5% event rate at 1 year compared with 32.3% for non-100% responders (p = 0.008). Patients receiving bisoprolol during the TIBBS tria had a lower event rate (22.1%) at 1 year than patients randomized to nifedipine (33.1%, p = 0.033).; In patients with stable angina pectoris, frequent episodes of transient ischemia are a marker for an increased event rate. A 100% response to medical treatment reduces the event rate. The greater reduction of ischemia with bisoprolol than nifedipine during the TIBBS trial translated into an improved outcome at 1 year.",I,E

Insulin sensitivity (by the minimal model method of Bergman), additional metabolic variables, clinic blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure profile and renal indices were assessed at the end of the placebo and active treatment phases.; Compared with placebo, the two therapies produced similar decreases in mean supine clinic blood pressure [10 +/- 3 versus 11 +/- 3% (means +/- SEM)], upright clinic blood pressure (10 +/- 4 versus 11 +/- 4%) and ambulatory daytime blood pressure (9 +/- 2 versus 12 +/- 3%). However, although the verapamil-trandolapril combination was found to be metabolically neutral, the atenolol-chlortalidone combination aggravated insulin resistance [insulin sensitivity index, from (0.8 +/- 0.2) to (0.3 +/- 0.1) x 10(-4)/min per U per ml], increased the serum triglycerides level and decreased the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and plasma potassium levels. Although both therapies tended to reduce 24 h albuminuria, this was significant for the verapamil-trandolapril treatment only.; Because the effect of any antihypertensive drug, including diuretics and beta-blockers, on cardiovascular morbidity and on mortality in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients is not known, rational treatment selection can presently be based only on surrogate end-points. Therefore, the triad of metabolic neutrality with antihypertensive and antiproteinuric efficacy supports combined verapamil-trandolapril as a potentially valuable therapy for hypertension accompanying diabetes mellitus.",E,E

The therapeutic evaluation was frequently invasive (145 patients underwent at least programmed ventricular stimulation, 108 patients underwent full endocavitary electrophysiological studies) and non-pharmacological therapy was widely used (defibrillator n = 44; antiarrhythmic surgery n = 28; ablative procedures n = 19; transplantation n = 7). The following underlying pathologies were observed: ischaemic heart disease n = 120; non-ischaemic left heart disease n = 19; right heart cardiac disease n = 4; and apparently normal hearts n = 17). The average ejection fraction was 40.5 +/- 15.5% and 29 patients were in the NYHA functional classes III or IV. Fifty-five patients had life-threatening arrhythmias whilst receiving amiodarone. At 2 years, the actuarial sudden death rate was 5.9 +/- 2.1% and the actuarial total cardiac mortality rate was 13.1 +/- 2.9%. Univariate analysis showed age, the presence of underlying cardiac disease, the presence of dilated cardiomyopathy, the absence of an invasive approach, the need for basal pacing in electrical cardioversion, the absence of betablocker therapy, a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and a high NYHA functional class, to be predictive of sudden death. In multivariate analysis, age, the NYHA class for total cardiac mortality and the NYHA class for sudden death, were the only independent predictive factors. The authors conclude that in the era of invasive methods of evaluation and widespread use of non-pharmacological therapeutic methods, the symptomatology of cardiac failure assessed by the NYHA classification remains the most powerful independent prognostic factor after an episode of malignant ventricular arrhythmia.",1,E

Transmitral Doppler echocardiography was used to evaluate diastolic function in 77 patients randomly assigned to placebo (n = 37) or metoprolol (n = 40). The patients were treated for 12 months. Changes in Doppler flow variables in the metoprolol group implied a less restrictive filling pattern, expressed as an increase in E-wave deceleration time (placebo, 185 +/- 126 to 181 +/- 64 ms; metoprolol, 152 +/- 63 to 216 +/- 78 ms; P = .01, placebo versus metoprolol). Maximal increase in deceleration time had occurred by 3 months, whereas systolic recovery was achieved gradually and maximal effect was seen by 12 months of treatment. Although deceleration time was correlated to heart rate at baseline, changes in deceleration time were not significantly correlated to changes in heart rate during treatment.; During the first 3 months of treatment, maximal effects on diastolic variables were reached, whereas the most prominent effect on systolic function was seen late in the study. It is suggested that effects on diastolic filling account for subsequent later myocardial systolic recovery.

Losartan is well tolerated, with an adverse effect profile similar to that of placebo and a reduced incidence of cough versus that with ACE inhibitors. A combination product consisting of losartan 50 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg has also received approval for the treatment of hypertension. The combination product is not indicated for initial therapy, but is recommended for patients who do not respond adequately to losartan monotherapy.

No such difference was found in male patients. Inverse relationships were found between age and E/A ratio in both controls (r = -0.45, p < 0.001) and angina patients (r = -0.44, p < 0.001). Thus, despite similar frequency of clinical heart failure, left ventricular systolic dysfunction was more common in men than in women with stable angina.",E,E

However, the effects of losartan on insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism have not been investigated in detail. Therefore, we carried out a randomized, double-blind study to compare the effects of losartan (50 mg QD) and metoprolol (95 mg QD) on insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, glucose tolerance, and lipids and lipoproteins in 20 hyperinsulinemic subjects with essential hypertension. The fall in blood pressure was greater with losartan than with metoprolol. Insulin sensitivity evaluated by the euglycemic clamp technique did not change in either group after 12 weeks of treatment. Similarly, glucose oxidation (losartan: 17.0 +/- 0.9 versus 16.9 +/- 1.0 mumol/kg per minute [before versus after, P = NS]; metoprolol: 17.9 +/- 1.3 versus 16.8 +/- 1.6 [P = NS]) and nonoxidation (losartan: 22.3 +/- 4.0 versus 23.5 +/- 3.4 mumol/kg per minute [P = NS]; metoprolol: 23.3 +/- 3.2 versus 25.6 +/- 4.7 [P = NS]) remained unchanged during the last 30 minutes of the 3-hour euglycemic clamp. Losartan and metoprolol did not have any significant adverse effects on insulin secretion, glucose tolerance, or lipids and lipoproteins. In conclusion, losartan is metabolically neutral, without any significant adverse effect on glucose and lipid metabolism.",E,E

There was no significant change in the median rCBF in any of the three treatment groups. Neither did we observe any lateralization of BF to any specific cerebral region in any of the three groups. There were no observed or patient-reported adverse events (AE). Single 5-mg oral doses of either ramipril or enalapril did not decrease CBF significantly in asymptomatic hypertensive patients with > or = 70% stenosis of an internal carotid artery and are probably safe starting doses in such patients.

Beta blockers are widely used in ischemic heart disease, but their effects on left ventricular mechanics and exercise tolerance are poorly defined in the subgroup of patients with significant systolic dysfunction but without clinical evidence of ischemia or congestive heart failure. Angiographic and symptom-limited exercise data were obtained at baseline and after an 8-10-week double-blind treatment with placebo (n = 10), 50 mg atenolol daily (n = 10), or 2.5 mg (n = 10) or 5 mg (n = 10) nebivolol daily. When compared to placebo, both atenolol and nebivolol reduced resting heart rate and improved left ventricular ejection fraction (from 33.9 to 39.2% with atenolol and from 36.5 to 40.8% with nebivolol, both P < .05) while lowering mean systolic wall stress. Only nebivolol, however, produced a parallel downward shift of the pressure-volume relationship during early diastolic filling and improved the early peak filling rate when compared to placebo (+ 10%, P < .05). When compared to baseline, maximal exercise duration increased by 7 and 13 seconds with placebo and atenolol, respectively (both NS vs baseline), and increased by 44 seconds with nebivolol (P = .0077 vs baseline). Both atenolol and nebivolol decreased maximal exercise heart rate; the reduction was more pronounced with atenolol. Prolonged beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade leads to a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. The dissociation between the changes in resting left ventricular function and the changes in exercise duration suggests that in this clinical setting, the changes in systolic function may have less impact on functional capacity than an improvement in diastolic distensibility during the rapid filling phase.",E,E

It is not known, however, whether continuous ST monitoring provides additional prognostic information in such a setting.; Observational study of 212 patients with unstable angina without evidence of acute myocardial infarction admitted to district general hospitals, who had participated in a randomised study comparing heparin and aspirin treatment versus aspirin alone.; Clinical variables and a 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded at admission, and treatment was standardised to include aspirin, atenolol, diltiazem, and intravenous glyceryl trinitrate, in addition to intravenous heparin (randomised treatment). Continuous ST segment monitoring was performed for 48 h and all inhospital adverse events were recorded.; The admission ECG was normal in 61 patients (29%), showed ST depression in 59 (28%) (17 > or = 0.1 mV), and T wave changes in a further 69 (33%). The remaining 23 had Q waves (18), right bundle branch block (four), or ST elevation (one). During 8963 h of continuous ST segment monitoring (mean 42.3 h/patient), 132 episodes of transient myocardial ischaemia (104 silent) were recorded in 32 patients (15%). Forty patients (19%) had an adverse event (cardiac deaths (n = 3), non-fatal myocardial infarction (n = 6) and, emergency revascularisation (n = 31)). Both admission ECG ST depression (P = 0.02), and transient ischaemia (P < 0.001) predicted an increased risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or death, while no patients with a normal ECG died or had a myocardial infarction. Adverse outcome was predicted by admission ECG ST depression (regardless of severity) (odds ratio (OR) 3.41) (P < 0.001), and maintenance beta blocker treatment (OR 2.95) (P < 0.01). A normal ECG predicted a favourable outcome (OR 0.38) (P = 0.04), while T wave or other ECG changes were not predictive of outcome. Transient ischaemia was the strongest predictor of adverse prognosis (OR 4.61) (P < 0.001), retaining independent predictive value in multivariate analysis (OR 2.94) (P = 0.03), as did maintenance beta blocker treatment (OR 2.85) (P = 0.01) and admission ECG ST depression, which showed a trend towards independent predictive value (OR 2.11) (P = 0.076).; Patients with unstable angina and a normal admission ECG have a good prognosis, while ST segment depression predicts an adverse outcome.

8808164,Calcium antagonists during and after myocardial infarction.,Animals; Calcium Channel Blockers; Humans; Hypertension; Myocardial Infarction; Recurrence,"Sleight, P","Calcium antagonists, or calcium channel entry blockers, have been advocated as cardioprotective agents in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on the basis of animal experiments, which show that they will reduce the harmful effects of the calcium overload which follows ischaemia, particularly during reperfusion, and also that they will reduce coronary artery spasm. Unfortunately, these promising actions have not translated into clear mortality data. An overview of the large amount of data from properly randomised controlled clinical trials shows clear differences between the dihydropyridine class of calcium antagonists such as nifedipine, and the non-dihydropyridines verapamil and diltiazem. Most of the data with the former group derive from trials with short-acting formulations of nifedipine (TRENT, HINT, SPRINT-I and -II). Overall, none of these trials showed significant benefit in either AMI or post-MI prophylaxis. There was a trend for harm, with HINT stopped early because of excess reinfarction with nifedipine, compared with metoprolol. In contrast, and when taken together, the DAVIT-I and DAVIT-II studies with verapamil show significant reductions in sudden death, reinfarction and total mortality. The greatest benefit occurred in those patients with relatively good left ventricular function. Similar but less significant trends were seen in studies with diltiazem. It is clear that calcium antagonists, unlike beta-blockers, cannot be treated as a similar class. It seems likely that the adverse effects of nifedipine are related to reflex sympathetic cardiac stimulation as a result of the predominantly vasodilator action of these dihydropyridine compounds. Data on newer dihydropyridines with fewer reflex effects are awaited. In the meantime it seems sensible to use proven agents such as beta-blockers or verapamil. These data on AMI and the months following have recently been paralleled by case control studies in hypertension, which similarly have suggested harm from the use of predominantly short acting formulations of nifedipine compared with beta-blockers and which led to a warning statement by the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute on 1 September 1995.",E,E

Though a prophylactic treatment both with beta-adrenergic blocking agents and the calcium antagonist diltiazem has been used for the prevention of post-operative SVT, no study yet has performed a prospective comparison of the efficacy of these therapies.; To investigate the prophylactic effect of either a calcium antagonist (diltiazem, 0.1 mg/kg per h i.v.) or a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (propranolol, 10 mg every 6 h postoperatively), we randomized prospectively 103 consecutive patients into three groups, the third one serving as a control group. Anti-arrhythmic medication was started with the procedure and was continued until the 3rd postoperative day.; Preoperative conditions were the same for the three groups concerning age, extent of coronary heart disease, ventricular function and heart-related medication. There were no differences in intraoperative parameters or postoperative enzyme patterns. Diltiazem was ineffective in preventing SVT, the incidence being exactly the same as in the control group (35%). Propranolol reduced the occurrence of SVT significantly (7%, P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients treated with diltiazem needed positive inotropic support more often in the first hours after surgery than patients of the control group (30% vs 5%, P < 0.01).; The perioperative administration of low-dose propranolol is considered a safe and effective drug prophylaxis to avoid the occurrence of SVT after bypass surgery.",E,E

Twenty outpatients with mild to moderate essential arterial hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris and positive exercise test, after a 2-week baseline placebo period, were randomized to receive long-acting metoprolol (OROS) 14/190 mg o.d., nifedipine SR 20 mg b.i.d. or their combination in a sequence of a 3 x 3 Latin square design. Two patients withdrew from the study (1 for adverse event during metoprolol and 1 for rise of BP during nifedipine). Nifedipine, metoprolol and their combination significantly reduced the weekly number of angina attacks and nitroglycerin consumption with respect to baseline. The total number of ischemic events (at 24-hour ECG monitoring) significantly decreased after each treatment with respect to baseline. Twenty-four hours mean systolic and diastolic BP were reduced by both nifedipine alone and metoprolol alone; the combination of the two drugs led to a further decrease in both systolic and diastolic BP. The duration of silent ischemic episodes was significantly reduced by nifedipine and combination but not by metoprolol. On the other hand 24 hours symptomatic attacks/patient were significantly reduced by beta-blocker and combination, but not by nifedipine. Metoprolol alone and administered with nifedipine caused a decrease, with respect to placebo baseline, in 24-hour mean heart rate (HR) and reduced the increase of HR and systolic BP at the onset of ST depression during symptomatic ischemic episodes. The effort time and time to ST = -1 mm at treadmill were significantly increased by treatment with nifedipine alone, with metoprolol alone and with their combination, but the combination was more effective than the individual therapies. ST depression at peak exercise was significantly reduced by each treatment. The slopes of correlations between the ST-segment variation and systolic BP, HR and rate-pressure product during exercise, significantly decreased after all treatments with respect to placebo baseline, more with the combination therapy than with nifedipine alone and metoprolol alone. In conclusion, based on our results the favourable interaction of metoprolol OROS and nifedipine given concomitantly, is likely to be due to a better control, respect to each individual therapy, of the pathogenetic mechanism of myocardia ischemia: BP and HR increases during exercise and during symptomatic ischemic episodes are controlled by the beta-blocker and coronary vasoconstriction during silent ischemia is prevented by the calcium-antagonist.",I,E

Patients with uncontrolled hypertension are at increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and renal failure. Many factors may play a role in the development of resistant hypertension, including misdiagnosis (pseudoresistance), noncompliance, occult secondary causes for hypertension, volume overload, obesity, cigarette smoking, excess alcohol intake, sleep apnea, interfering medications and suboptimal combinations of antihypertensives. Only beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics have been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertension.

All of these changes were greater (P < .05) than any tendency toward change in the placebo group. Adverse events and clinical laboratory abnormalities were generally mild and transient in both placebo and pravastatin groups. Study drugs were withdrawn from one subject in each group with asymptomatic creatine kinase elevations. We conclude that low-dose pravastatin was effective and safe in the treatment of hypercholesterolemic hypertensive subjects on concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It also improved fasting hyperinsulinemia despite the use of beta-blockers and diuretics in these hypertensive subjects.",E,E

The most common combination agents were composed of diuretics with either calcium channel blockers (5.4%), ACE inhibitors (4.0%), or beta-blockers (3.7%). Women were twice as likely to be taking diuretics, and less likely to be taking ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, than men. Blacks were more likely to be taking diuretics and calcium channel blockers, and less likely to be taking beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, than others. These relationships could not be attributed to differences in geographical area, other demographic factors, age, or medical history.; These usage patterns appear to mirror those in the population of the United States as a whole, which has trended toward greater usage of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors with declining use of diuretics. The distribution of antihypertensive medications among older hypertensives is markedly different between women and men and between black Americans and others.",E,E

The mechanisms of postexercise albuminuria are not fully clarified but stimulation of the reninangiotensin system (RAS) probably plays a major role through intrarenal haemodynamic changes causing an elevated filtration pressure. In a randomised, double-blind, crossover study we compared the effects on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) of lisinopril (L) and atenolol (A) therapy, i.e. we aimed to investigate whether inhibition of the RAS or inhibition of beta1-adrenoceptor-mediated effects of the sympathetic nervous system differed with regard to changes in UAE. Sixteen patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension were studied. Four standardised bicycle ergometer exercise tests were performed, before and after each active treatment period. UAE 30 min postexercise, determined by radioimmunoassay, was significantly lowered by both treatments: -278 mu g center dot min-1 (L) and -199 mu g center dot min-1 (A). The reduction of postexercise UAE achieved by treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (L) was significantly greater than that achieved by the beta1-selective adrenoceptor blocker treatment. Blood pressure (BP) at rest and during exercise were equally reduced by both drugs. In conclusion, this study showed that antihypertensive treatment with an ACE inhibitor was more effective in reducing exercise-induced albuminuria than a beta1-selective adrenoceptor-blocking agent with a similar degree of BP reduction in patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension. This suggests that the RAS plays a major role in postexercise albuminuria in hypertensive subjects. The clinical significance of this finding, however, remains to be clarified.",E,E

However the specific effects on LV diastolic function have been subjected to only limited examination. This study investigated the effects of the combined beta blocker/vasodilator, carvedilol, on systolic and diastolic LV performance in dilated cardiomyopathy. Thirty-six patients with New York Heart Association II to III heart failure and LV ejection fraction < or = 0.35 were entered into either arm of this placebo-controlled, double-blind 4-month trial. Twenty-one subjects were entered into the carvedilol treatment arm and 15 patients were entered into the placebo arm in a 3:2 ratio. Carvedilol therapy resulted in a significant improvement in LV ejection fraction, from 0.22 +/- 0.02 to 0.30 +/- 0.02 when compared with the placebo group (0.19 +/- 0.02 to 0.21 +/- 0.02 at baseline and after 4 months of therapy, respectively; p = 0.0001). However, no significant change in radionuclide parameters of LV diastolic function, including peak filling rate or time to peak filling rate, was observed. LV end-diastolic volume index did not change with carvedilol therapy, whereas end-diastolic volume index increased in the placebo group, although the difference between groups at 4 months was significant (p = 0.02). In conjunction with these changes, end-systolic volume index was smaller at 4 months after carvedilol treatment compared with that of the placebo group (p = 0.04). Thus, these results demonstrate that in moderate chronic heart failure, systolic LV performance improves but diastolic LV function does not improve when compared with placebo after treatment with carvedilol.",E,E

Blacks with hypertension and moderately reduced renal function were randomized to one of two levels of blood pressure control and to one of three antihypertensive drug regimens: primary therapy with a calcium channel blocker, an angiotension converting enzyme inhibitor, or a beta-blocker. Of the 94 participants in AASK, 91 had MEMS recordings and pill counts for 313 regularly scheduled monthly follow-up visits. The average length of follow-up was 4.6 months. An acceptable level of adherence by pill count was achieved if 80% to 100% of the prescribed pills were not returned to the clinic. Adherence by MEMS to a once-a-day drug dosing schedule was acceptable if 80% of the time intervals between MEMS openings were within 24 +/- 6 h. Acceptable adherence by pill count was observed at 68% of the follow-up visits; MEMS indicated nonadherence at 47% of those visits. Blood pressure was within goal in 50% of the participants who were adherent by both pill count and MEMS throughout their follow-up visits, and only 14% of the participants who were identified nonadherent by one or both methods. These findings suggest that electronic monitoring is a useful adjunct to pill counts in assessing adherence to antihypertensive drugs. Feedback of electronically collected information on dosing intervals to participants and staff may enhance adherence.",E,E

General practitioners in Belgium and the Netherlands each recruited patients for whom they would prescribe one of the study medications in the normal course of their treatment and recorded all medical events on follow-up forms for up to 8 months. A total of 1601 migraine patients were enrolled; 838 in the flunarizine cohort and 763 in the propranolol cohort. Propranolol was somewhat better than flunarizine in reducing the severity of migraine attacks, although this may have been due to a selection bias. Discontinuations of therapy due to events considered likely to be treatment-related were mostly due to the recognized side effects of the two drugs. As regards the occurrence of depressions, a total of 58 patients had depressive events, 34 in the flunarizine cohort and 24 in the propranolol cohort. Whereas migraine itself appears to be associated with an increased risk of depression, the number of previous migraine treatments was shown to be an additional risk factor for the development of depression in patients receiving flunarizine as was a history of depression. Overall, there was no appreciable difference in the risk/benefit ratio between flunarizine and propranolol.",I,E

We reviewed all studies published between 1980 and August 1993 reporting the circadian efficacy of antihypertensive drugs and using ambulatory BP monitoring. In all, 815 patients with essential hypertension were assessed in 51 studies of eight different beta-blockers, six ACE inhibitors, and eight calcium antagonists. As main outcome measures, relative (percentage) BP reductions during the day and at night were compared between the three classes of antihypertensive drugs. Results were also separated for different dosing schemes (once and more than once daily). With all three classes of antihypertensive agents, the percentage night BP reduction was approximately 1-3% less as compared with percentage reductions during the day. Only for systolic BP (SBP) of the calcium antagonists administered once daily was this difference significant [2.2%, confidence interval (CI) 0.3-4.0%, p < 0.05], due to a higher statistical power in this group of agents. Our results show that beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium antagonists are comparably effective during the day and at night, and no evidence indicates that either of the three agents is preferable to obtain the best possible antihypertensive effect at night.",E,E

The studied groups included randomly selected men with newly diagnosed primary hypertension at baseline (n = 23) and normotensive (NT) men of the same age (n = 11). The hypertensives (HT) were treated with beta-blockers either as monotherapy or combined with diuretics or hydralazine. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR; inulin clearance), renal blood flow (RBF, para-aminohippurate clearance), renal vascular resistance (RVR), and 24-h UAE were determined. The two groups were investigated at baseline (before treatment) and after 7 and 14 years. At baseline, BP and RVR were significantly increased and RBF was significantly decreased in the HT over that in the NT. The BP in the HT was significantly reduced after 7 years of treatment and a further but nonsignificant reduction to 139 +/- 14/88 +/- 6 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) was seen after 14 years. GFR in the HT was significantly reduced from 103 +/- 15 mL/min to 84 +/- 19 mL/min (mean +/- SD) after 7 years, but no further reduction was seen after 14 years. During the 14 years RBF decreased and RVR increased in the HT but these changes were of the same magnitude as in the NT. The UAE did not change significantly during the study. In conclusion, good blood pressure control with conventional antihypertensive treatment in mild to moderate primary hypertension seems to protect the kidney from progressive decline in GFR and increase in UAE. The increase in RVR and the decrease in RBF seen during 14 years of antihypertensive treatment was of the same magnitude as that seen with normal aging.",E,E

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to be more effective in this regard than conventional antihypertensive therapy. In a recent prospective, randomized, double blind trial in 257 patients with essential hypertension, the loss of GFR, determined with 51Cr-EDTA clearance, was significantly less with an ACE inhibitor (cilazapril) than with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker (atenolol) during the first year of treatment. However, after 2 years, the two therapies were equally effective in this regard, thereby creating doubts about the long-term superiority of ACE inhibition in this regard. In order to elucidate whether the superior renal preservation with the ACE inhibitor was a transient effect, GFR was measured after 1 more year of treatment, i.e., after 36 months. At that time, the decline in GFR was significantly smaller in the ACE inhibitor group as compared to the beta-adrenoceptor blocker group (-3.0 [-5.5, -1.0; 95% CI] v -7.0 [-9.0, -4.5; 95% CI] mL/min x 1.73 m2; P = .026).

Physiologic rational for the chronobiology of cardiac disease exists and can provide a basis on which to examine the efficacy of agents to manage cardiac disease. The use of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) devices have advanced our ability to describe the interplay of chronobiologic rhythms and pharmacodynamic response to antihypertensive medications. This review summarizes the studies evaluating the use of various antihypertensive medications in the context of using 24-hour blood pressure monitoring devices. The studies are described in an attempt to increase awareness of chronobiology and potential implications of designing chronotherapeutic regimens.,E,E

The increase in left ventricular mass in patients with essential hypertension is at least partly induced by the sympathetic nervous system. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare the effects of alpha-blockers and beta-blockers on left ventricular structure and function. Forty-three patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were randomly allocated to receive antihypertensive therapy with either the alpha-blocker bunazosin (n = 23) or the beta-blocker metoprolol (n = 20). Twenty-four-hour blood pressure measurements and echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular structure and function were performed before therapy, after 6 months of therapy, and 4 weeks after discontinuation of therapy. Bunazosin and metoprolol led to similar reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure (-11 +/- 11/-9 +/- 8 mm Hg vs -11 +/- 12/-8 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively) and left ventricular mass (-25 +/- 42 gm vs -28 +/- 44 gm, respectively) (p = no significant difference, bunazosin vs metoprolol). Neither metoprolol nor bunazosin significantly affected left ventricular systolic function. Diastolic left ventricular filling, however, was increased with beta-blocker medication, as indicated by a decrease in atrial filling fraction (39% +/- 5% to 34% +/- 5%; p < 0.05), but not with the alpha-blocker. The effect of metoprolol resulted from its bradycardiac effect. Four weeks after discontinuation of therapy, blood pressure and left ventricular mass increased to pretreatment levels in both groups similarly. Furthermore, the increase in diastolic filling was lost shortly after withdrawal of metoprolol concomitant with the increase in heart rate. We conclude that alpha-blockers and beta-blockers are equally capable of reducing left ventricular mass in hypertensive patients. beta-Blockers lead to an increase in diastolic left ventricular filling. This effect may be of therapeutic value because diastolic dysfunction may precede systolic dysfunction in hypertensive heart disease.",E,E

Patients were evaluated on placebo and after 8 weeks of treatment with either cilazapril, 2.5-5 mg/day (13 patients) or atenolol, 50-100 mg/day (14 patients). Twenty-four-hour blood pressure was similarly reduced (p < 0.01) by both cilazapril and atenolol. Heart rate decreased with atenolol by 14 beats per min (p < 0.001) but did not change with cilazapril. When compared to the placebo, cilazapril did not modify sympathetic activity indices of HRV but did significantly reduce NA and DOPEG levels in both the supine and standing (p < 0.05) positions. As expected, atenolol reduced (p < 0.05) sympathetic activity indices of HRV but did not modify NA levels in either position. Moreover, while on placebo, patients showed no significant correlations between values of NA or DOPEG, nor in any of the HRV indices. We conclude that: (1) the antihypertensive effects of cilazapril and atenolol are similar, but in these patients, sympathetic activity indices showed divergent results both before and after therapy; (2) this may be due to different aspects of sympathetic activators, assessed independently by different methods, and (3) these discrepancies must be taken into account when evaluating autonomous nervous system parameters.",E,E

This approach does not necessarily detect the rare adverse events that may only be observed when very large numbers of patients are studied. Consequently, we designed a double-blind 12-week trial comparing the new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril (n = 5,053), with a well-established beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, metoprolol (n = 506). Essentially hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure 95-114 mm Hg) received either 10 mg quinapril or 50 mg metoprolol once daily, and the doses were doubled at 4-week intervals to a maximum of 40 and 200 mg, respectively, in nonresponders. Responder rates were similar under both regimens. Adverse events were assessed by interview as well as by a standard questionnaire. The overall prevalence of adverse events reported by standard questionnaire was higher than that reported spontaneously during interviews. With respect to typical ACE inhibitor adverse reactions (e.g. cough and taste disturbances), there was no difference between quinapril and metoprolol independent of the mode of reporting. In summary, both drugs showed comparable overall tolerance and safety. The discrepancy between spontaneously reported and questionnaire-reported adverse events was noteworthy, and this finding prevailed in a volunteer group of 327 patients who were treated with quinapril for 52 weeks. Thus, a questionnaire is of great significance in addition to the patient history/interview in a large-scale, double-blind study designed to learn about details of drug safety.",I,E

A total of 1305 men who were free of diagnosed CHD completed the revised Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2) in 1986. Subjects were categorized according to their responses to the MMPI-2 Anger Content Scale, which measures the degree to which individuals have problems controlling their anger.

This pharmacological profile suggests that cyclandelate may have a potential prophylactic effect in migraine. To test this hypothesis, a double-blind multicentre study was performed in 214 patients to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of cyclandelate compared to placebo and propranolol. After a 4-week baseline period, eligible patients (randomization 3:2:3) were treated for 12 weeks with daily doses of 1.200 mg cyclandelate (n = 81), placebo (n = 55) or 120 mg propranolol (n = 78). The number of migraine attacks (> or = 50% responders) and the migraine duration/month were compared based on the difference between baseline and the last 4 weeks of prophylactic treatment. The percentage of patients with a reduction in migraine attacks of > or = 50% treated with cyclandelate (37.0%) or propranolol (42.3%) was not significantly superior to placebo (30.9%; p > 0.025). The mean duration of migraine in hours (h) per month decreased in both active treatment groups (cyclandelate: 36.8 h, p = 0.046; propranolol: 34.4 h, p = 0.039) compared to placebo (13.7 h) without reaching statistical significance (alpha/2 = 0.025). The clinical efficacy of cyclandelate and propranolol was comparable. Adverse experiences were reported by 13 patients (16.0%) treated with cyclandelate, by 5 patients (9.1%) treated with placebo and by 19 patients (24.4%) treated with propranolol. These were drug-related in 7.1% (n = 6) of patients treated with cyclandelate and in 9% (n = 7) of patients treated with propranolol. In summary, cyclandelate has a comparable efficacy to that of propranolol, an established drug of first choice in the prophylaxis of migraine. Both drugs were better than placebo, but not significantly so. Both active treatments were well tolerated.",I,I

Clinical experience with losartan from worldwide, double-blind, controlled studies has been obtained in more than 2900 hypertensive patients treated with losartan alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, with 1700 patients receiving treatment for more than a year. The efficacy of losartan was evaluated in the young and old, in different degrees of hypertension, in blacks and nonblacks, and in patients with renal impairment. Tolerability parameters were assessed by subgroup as well. In dose-ranging studies, 50 mg once daily has generally been shown to produce near maximum effects and a dose of 100 mg does not produce additional effects. The efficacy of losartan (50 to 100 mg once daily) has been compared to atenolol (50 to 100 mg once daily), felodipine ER (5 to 10 mg once daily), and enalapril (20 mg once daily). The blood pressure-lowering effect of losartan was comparable to felodipine, enalapril, and atenolol. The efficacy of losartan was demonstrated using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, which showed that losartan 50 mg once daily produced gradual reduction in blood pressure, providing 24-h control without affecting the body's circadian rhythm. In subgroups of study populations, no differences in efficacy were noted with respect to age, gender and the severity of hypertension. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in the elderly and patients with renal impairment (even those on dialysis). Among blacks, the mean response of losartan was lower, which is not surprising given the lesser activation of the renin-angiotensin system in this population. A subgroup safety and tolerability analysis confirmed that there were no important differences in adverse events when assessed by age, race, or gender. The data obtained from controlled clinical trials conducted with losartan, the first A II-receptor antagonist, has shown that a single daily 50-mg dose provides adequate 24-h control of blood pressure in most patients with comparable efficacy to other classes and is well tolerated.",E,E

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have variable effects on proteinuria; their long-term effects on progression of diabetic nephropathy are not known. The current study examines the hypothesis that CCBs that maintain reductions in proteinuria slow progression of nephropathy associated with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) by a degree comparable to ACE inhibitors, given similar levels of blood pressure control. To test this hypothesis we randomized 52 patients with NIDDM associated nephropathy and hypertension, mean age of 63 +/- 8 years, to either the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril (N = 18), nondihydropyridine CCBs (NDCCBs), verapamil SR (N = 8) or diltiazem SR (N = 10), or the beta blocker, atenolol (N = 16). Goal blood pressure was < or = 140/90 mm Hg. Patients were followed for a mean period of 63 +/- 7 months. The primary end point was change in creatinine clearance (CCr) slope in each group. There was no significant difference in mean arterial pressure reduction among the groups over the study period (P = 0.14). The mean rate of decline in CCr was greatest in the atenolol group (-3.48 ml/min/year/1.73 m2; P < 0.0001). There was no difference in the CCr slopes between lisinopril and NDCCBs groups (P = 0.36). Proteinuria was reduced to a similar extent in the lisinopril and NDCCBs groups (P > 0.99). Therefore, in persons with renal insufficiency secondary to NIDDM, similar levels of blood pressure control with either lisinopril or NDCCBs slowed progression of renal disease to a greater extent than atenolol. Moreover, this enhanced slowing of renal disease progression correlated with sustained and significant reductions in proteinuria, findings not observed in the atenolol group.",E,E

Beta blockers prevent atrial fibrillation postoperatively, but there are few data regarding the prophylactic use of type 1 antiarrhythmic agents or the prevention of ventricular arrhythmias. Accordingly, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of oral procainamide on 100 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery. Procainamide was received for 4 days; the dosage was adjusted for body weight. Patients receiving procainamide had a significant reduction in atrial fibrillation (16 vs 29 patient-days, p < 0.05) and ventricular tachycardia (2% vs 20%, p < 0.01). However, the incidence of atrial fibrillation was not significantly reduced (38% vas 26%). In the group achieving therapeutic serum procainamide levels, there was reduction in all measured postoperative arrhythmias. No serious cardiac or noncardiac adverse events were noted during procainamide therapy, although there was a significant increase in the incidence of nausea. We conclude that procainamide reduces arrhythmias in the early postoperative period after coronary artery bypass surgery, most prominently in patients who achieve therapeutic serum levels.

A review.,Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists; Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists; Animals; Humans; Hypertension; Quinazolines,"Weidinger, G","Bunazosin (CAS 52712-76-2), a quinazoline derivative, selectively blocks alpha1-receptors. In addition to its potent antihypertensive property, beneficial effects on lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, it can be used in the presence of concomitant diseases, such as obstructive bronchitis, chronic renal insufficiency, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, and diabetes mellitus. In its extended-release formulation (bunazosin retard), it is generally a well-tolerated alpha1-blocker when compared to other agents in its class. Pharmacokinetic studies in normotensive volunteers showed that plasma peak concentration (Cmax) of bunazosin retard and bioavailability were approximately 50% and 81%, respectively, of the values of the standard non-retarded formulation. Bunazosin is metabolized mainly in the liver, and urine excretion accounts for only 10% of unchanged bunazosin. Following oral administration of 6 mg bunazosin retard to healthy volunteers, Cmax was 15 ng/ml, time to reach peak level (tmax) was 4 h and elimination half life was about 12 h. Bunazosin retard has Cmax and area underthe concentration curve (AUC) to be linearly related to the dose between 3 and 18 mg (r = 0.8). As expected, patients with impaired hepatic functions have shown an increase in AUC, Cmax, and elimination half live values. The hemodynamic effects of bunazosin are due to arterial vasodilation, reduced peripheral vascular resistance and cardiac afterload with moderate increase increase of cardiac output. Bunazosin was shown to decrease the systolic and diastolic blood pressure without a reflex tachycardia. In addition to its hypotensive effects bunazosin significantly increased the effective renal blood flow (by 34%) and creatinine clearance (by 37%) in patients with essential hypertension. In patients with impaired renal function bunazosin exhibits better increase in the effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate when compared to other alpha1-blockers (e.g. prazosin). Results of double-blind, randomized trials in 343 hypertensive patients showed bunazosin to be a equipotent hypertensive agent without multiple titration as usually necessary for other alpha-blockers. Diastolic blood pressure was normalized (< or equal 90 mmHg) or reduced by at least 10 mm Hg in 47% and 46% of patients, respectively. Results of two one-year long term studies in more than 600 驴young驴 and 驴elderly驴 hypertensive patients gave no hint for tachyphylaxia. Bunazosin proved to be superior to prazosin in terms of orthostatic tolerance, as tested with the Schellong test.

The 18 patients, (10 in New York Heart Association functional class III and 8 in class IV) were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Bisoprolol was administered as the first drug in 10 patients and diltiazem was administered in 8. Cross-over to bisoprolol was also performed in 3 patients. At the end of the study, among the 13 patients who had been given bisoprolol, 9 showed a good response (efficacy rate: 69%). In contrast, only 3 of the 8 patients who received diltiazem showed a good response (efficacy rate: 37.5%). Among the patients in NYHA class III, all 7 (100%) who were treated with bisoprolol responded but only 2 of the 4 (50%) treated with diltiazem responded (p < 0.05). Among the patients in class IV, 2 of 6 (33%) responded to bisoprolol and 1 of 4 (25%) responded to diltiazem (not significant). These results suggest that diltiazem, like bisoprolol, has a beneficial effect in patients with DCM, with a greater effect in class III patients. However, we conclude that diltiazem should usually be used as a second choice to improve heart failure in DCM, and as the first medication only in those with contraindications to beta-blocking agents.",I,E

In addition, treatment with carvedilol was associated with a significant increase in ejection fraction (P < .001) and a significant decrease in the combined risk of morbidity and mortality (P = .029). In contrast, carvedilol therapy had little effect on indirect measures of patient benefit, including changes in exercise tolerance or quality-of-life scores. The effects of the drug were similar in patients with ischemic heart disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy as the cause of heart failure.; These findings indicate that, in addition to its favorable effects on survival, carvedilol produces important clinical benefits in patients with moderate to severe heart failure treated with digoxin, diuretics, and an ACE inhibitor.",I,I

Recent studies have provided a theoretic framework for anticipating that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and possibly calcium antagonists, may preferentially retard the progression of renal disease. Whereas the majority of available clinical trials have assessed the effects of ACE inhibitors in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), there are relatively few long-term studies that have evaluated the renal protective effects of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists in patients with nondiabetic renal disease. Although clinical trials have been initiated using both of these drug classes as monotherapy, theoretical considerations suggest that fixed-dose combinations of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist might be appealing as renal protective agents. Several lines of evidence suggest that the renal microcirculatory effects of coadministration of both agents should be complementary. Similarly, recent observations suggest that the two classes may act in a complementary manner to countervail pathogenetic mechanisms at the level of the mesangium. A recent study in type II diabetic patients demonstrated that combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist induced the greatest reduction in proteinuria, and reduced the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) more than did either agent alone at the same level of blood pressure reduction. Based on such considerations, recent randomized prospective studies have been initiated to compare the renal protective effects of combination calcium antagonist-ACE inhibitor therapy versus monotherapy with agents of either of these two antihypertensive classes.",E,E

Their mean blood pressure at entry to the study was 160/94 mmHg at a mean age of 57 years. They were allocated to tight control (aiming for systolic < 150/diastolic < 85 mmHg) or to less tight control (aiming for systolic < 180/diastolic < 105 mmHg). The tight control group were allocated to primary therapy either with a beta blocker (atenolol) or with an antiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril), with addition of other agents as required. Over 5 years, the mean blood pressure in the tight control group was significantly lower (143/82 vs 154/88 mmHg, p < 0.001). No difference was seen between those allocated to atenolol or captopril. The proportion of patients requiring three or more antihypertensive therapies to maintain tight control in those allocated to atenolol or captopril increased from 16 and 15%, respectively at 2 years to 25 and 26%, respectively at 5 years, whereas in the less tight control group at 2 and 5 years only 5 and 7%, respectively required three or more therapies. There was no difference in the incidence of side effects or hypoglycaemic episodes between those allocated to atenolol or captopril, but those allocated to atenolol increased their body weight by a mean of 2.3 kg compared with 0.5 kg in those allocated to captopril (p < 0.01). Allocation to atenolol was also associated with small increases in triglyceride, and decreases in LDL and HDL cholesterol, which are of uncertain clinical relevance. The study is continuing to determine whether the improved blood pressure control, which was obtained, will be beneficial in maintaining the health of patients by decreasing the incidence of major clinical complications, principally myocardial infarction and strokes, and microvascular complications, such as severe retinopathy requiring photocoagulation and deterioration of renal function.",E,E

Now the focus is on the neurohumeral milieu and methods to counteract excess renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous system stimulation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the drugs of choice because they also improve survival, but beta-blockers are becoming popular.

Randomized treatment either with ramipril or with atenolol was continued for 6 months, and echocardiograms were recorded before and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. The echo tracings were blindly evaluated in a single reading centre.; M-mode, two-dimensional guided echocardiography was used to measure left ventricular wall thicknesses and dimensions, from which left ventricular mass was calculated, according to the Penn convention.; Of 193 patients at 16 centres, 111 had echocardiograms that could be quantitatively evaluated. The primary analysis of the study was performed using data from those patients. In addition, echocardiograms of 88 patients were analysed on an 'according to protocol' basis (patients with preset values of left ventricular mass). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced both by ramipril and by atenolol without any significant difference between the two drug treatments. The heart rate was significantly reduced by atenolol only. Both the 'primary' and the 'according to protocol' analyses showed that the left ventricular mass was significantly reduced by ramipril only. Comparison between treatments according to a multivariate analysis demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in left ventricular mass during ramipril than during atenolol treatment.; The present study is the first of suitably large size in which a direct comparison of the effects of an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker on echocardiographic left ventricular mass has been performed. It has demonstrated that ramipril is more effective than atenolol in reversing left ventricular hypertrophy in essential hypertensive patients.",E,E

Five end points were assessed: rebleeding, variceal rebleeding, death, death from bleeding, and adverse events. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat method. For each end point, heterogeneity and treatment efficacy were assessed by the Der Simonian and Peto methods. When a significant difference was observed, sensitivity analyses were performed by successive stratifications according to treatment duration, cause of initial bleeding, use of placebo, type of beta-blocker, type of publication, certainty of randomization, severity of cirrhosis, interval between index bleed and randomization, and methodological quality. Beta-blockers significantly increased the mean percentage of patients free of rebleeding (21% mean improvement rate, CI 95%: 10%-32%, P < .001, relative risk 1.42), the mean percentage of patients free of variceal rebleeding (20% mean improvement rate, CI 95%: 11%-28%, P < .001), the mean survival rate (5.4% mean improvement rate, CI 95%: 0%-11%, P = .05, relative risk 1.27), the mean percentage of patients free of bleeding death (7.4%, CI 95%: 2%-13%, P < .01, relative risk 1.50). Five patients would need to be treated with beta-blockers to prevent one rebleeding episode, 14 treated to prevent one death, and 13 treated to prevent one death from bleeding. There was no significant heterogeneity among studies by both methods of analysis. In patients with esophageal varices, beta-blockers significantly increase the mean percentage of patients free of rebleeding and the mean survival rate at 2 years.",E,E

After a single-blind placebo run-in period lasting 4-6 weeks, the patients were treated either with bunazosin retard or with atenolol for a further 16 weeks including an initial dose titration period to achieve blood pressure control. Treatment involved 3, 6 or 12 mg bunazosin retard tablets or 25, 50 or 100 mg atenolol tablets, administered orally once a day and prescribed according to blood pressure response. The euglycaemic hyper-insulinaemic clamp technique was used to assess insulin sensitivity both after the placebo period and after the active treatment. A total of 95 patients was enrolled in the study (placebo phase). Forty-eight patients were withdrawn from the placebo phase, mainly due to their blood pressures being outside the required range (seated diastolic blood pressure 90-114 mmHg) and 47 patients were allocated randomly to active treatment. Of these, 23 were administered bunazosin retard and 24 atenolol. All evaluations were on an intention-to-treat basis.; Insulin sensitivity assessed as glucose utilization during the clamp was significantly higher following bunazosin retard compared with following atenolol administration (3.52 +/- 0.27 versus 2.86 +/- 0.19 units of metabolic clearance rate of glucose index, P < 0.05). The insulin level attained during clamps (infusion rate 56 mU/m2 per min) was higher (P < 0.05) following atenolol (117 +/- 5 mU/l) than it was following bunazosin retard administration (102 +/- 5) or placebo (108 +/- 3), possibly due to an impaired insulin clearance. Compared with placebo, atenolol treatment resulted in significantly increased glucosylated haemoglobin whereas bunazosin retard had no significant effect. The two drugs did not show any consistent differences in lipid profile or fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 levels. During the study seven serious adverse events were reported and one was reported shortly after completion of the study. All except one were classified as not related to the study drug and five of them occurred during placebo treatment. The non-serious side effects were in general considered to be either unrelated to the test drugs or expected effects of the two respective drug classes. Both bunazosin retard and atenolol displayed acceptable safety profiles.; Bunazosin retard treatment in hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients appears to be associated with a slightly higher insulin sensitivity than is atenolol.",E,E

Chronic treatment with both drugs causes increases in extracellular 5-HT through 5-HT reuptake inhibition and desensitization of inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptors. It has been shown that pindolol, a serotonin (5-HT)1A-receptor antagonist, may shorten the latency of onset of SSRIs in depression. The aim of the present study was to examine whether pindolol may increase the efficacy of a subtherapeutical dosage of trazodone in the treatment of major depression and TRD, defined according to the Thase and Rush criteria (1995). Thirty-three major depressed inpatients of whom 26 with TRD participated in this study. Ten days after hospitalization, treatment with trazodone 100 mg/day was started. After 1 week trazodone treatment, patients were randomized-using a double blind placebo controlled design-to receive trazodone 100 mg/day+placebo; trazodone 100 mg/day+pindolol 7.5 mg/day: or trazodone 100 mg/day+fluoxetine 20 mg/day and treated during 4 weeks. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was used as outcome measure. It was found that trazodone+pindolol was as effective as trazodone+fluoxetine in the treatment of major depression and TRD and significantly more effective than trazodone+placebo. Using an outcome measure of 50% reduction in the HDRS, we found that 72.5% of the depressed patients treated with trazodone+pindolol and 75% of depressed patients treated with trazodone+fluoxetine showed a clinically significant response compared with 20.0% of trazodone+placebo-treated patients.",E,E

Participants were randomized to either chlorthalidone (2371), with step-up to atenolol, or reserpine if needed, or placebo (2365). The average baseline SBP/DBP was 170/77 mm Hg. In the active treatment group, step 1, dose 1 was chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/day; dose 2 was 25 mg/day. For step 2, dose 1 was atenolol 25 mg/day (or reserpine 0.05 mg/day if atenolol was contraindicated); dose 2 was 50 mg/day (reserpine, 0.10 mg/day). During 4.5 years average follow-up, 32% (757) of the active treatment group were on atenolol, with an average exposure of two years and 8% (193) were on reserpine with an average exposure of 1.7 years. Overall there were 96 strokes, 140 CHD events and 289 CVD events among the 2365 active group participants. Using time-dependent lifetable regression with adjustment for several variables, the addition of either atenolol or reserpine to chlorthalidone did not substantially alter the risk ratios for chlorthalidone alone. The relative risk for CHD events for atenolol versus no atenolol was 1.04 (95% confidence interval: 0.58, 1.86) and for reserpine versus no reserpine was 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.29, 2.96). The relative risk for atenolol were 0.84 (95% confidence interval: 0.54, 1.30) for death, 1.34 (95% confidence interval: 0.80, 2.28) for stroke, and 1.07 (95% confidence interval: 0.71, 1.61) for CVD. For reserpine, the corresponding relative risks and confidence intervals were 0.65 (0.26, 1.59) for death, 0.27 (0.04, 2.26) for stroke, and 0.55 (0.20, 1.49) for CVD. Thus, the beneficial effects in several outcomes in Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) were due to the treatment regimen of lowering blood pressure based on low-dose chlorthalidone (plus atenolol or reserpine as required to meet blood pressure criteria). Additional (independent) benefits attributable to atenolol or to reserpine were not identified. However, a greater number of patients might have been necessary to adequately evaluate potential differential effects of these drugs, especially for reserpine.",E,E

Both drugs reduced blood pressure (BP) well, but losartan tended to reduce left ventricular mass (LVM) in contrast to atenolol. Following the double-blind phase 19 patients entered an open treatment period with losartan and additional treatment if BP was uncontrolled. LV structures were measured by echocardiography. The mean follow-up period was 29 +/- 2.6 (range 26-32) months. BP was reduced from 155.6 +/- 15.6/103.4 +/- 5.2 mm Hg to 131.3 +/- 10.5/82.7 +/- 3.3 mm Hg (P < 0.001). LV internal diameter was reduced (50.7 +/- 4.5 to 49.1 +/- 4.0 mm; P = 0.006), while there was an increase in interventricular septal thickness (10.2 +/- 1.1 to 11.2 +/- 1.3 mm; P = 0.001) and posterior wall thickness (10.0 +/- 0.9 to 10.6 +/- 1.1 mm; P = 0.023).

To qualify for the study, subjects had to have an unmedicated clinic diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 mm Hg. After qualification, minimal drug requirements were established using a diuretic and a beta-blocker to control blood pressure at < or = 90 mm Hg. Subjects were then randomized into a 6-week cognitive-behavioral intervention or a measurements-only control group. After the treatment phase, medication levels were reduced in all subjects by means of a systematic stepdown procedure. Subjects were followed for 1 year after the stepdown was completed. Addition of the cognitive-behavioral intervention was twice as effective as the control procedure in reducing drug requirements. At 12-months follow-up, 73% of the treatment group were at lower levels of medication than at the time of randomization, compared to 35% in the control group. Moreover, 55% of the treatment group remained completely free of medication, compared to 30% of the control group, at the 12-month follow-up. The reductions in medication were associated with maintained controlled levels of clinic, ambulatory, and home blood pressure. The addition of a standardized and inexpensive group-administered cognitive-behavioral intervention to the drug treatment of hypertension is beneficial as an adjunctive treatment in reducing drug requirements for patients with hypertension, thereby reducing the costs and potential side effects of antihypertensive medications.",E,E

The subjects had chronic stable essential hypertension without secondary causes or unstable cardiovascular disease and were selected through the offices of 11 family physicians and a tertiary care hypertension research unit. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to either a patient-directed management strategy using home blood pressure monitoring to adjust drug therapy if readings consistently exceeded defined limits, or office-based management through physician visits. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean arterial pressure as determined by automatic ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Secondary endpoints were changes in compliance, quality of life, and health care resource use. Ninety-one potential subjects were screened and 31 were randomized. Subjects in the patient-directed management group employed the drug adjustment protocols appropriately without complications. A significant difference in change in mean blood pressure was observed, favoring the patient-directed management (-0.95 mm Hg and +1.90 mm Hg, respectively, for patient-directed management and office-based management, P = .039). Compliance rates and quality of life scores were not significantly different between groups. Physician visits were more frequent in the patient-directed management group (1.05 v 0.20 visits/8 weeks, respectively, for patient-directed management and office-based management groups, P = .045). A patient-directed hypertensive management strategy may be feasible for patients with chronic stable hypertension. Such a strategy may improve blood pressure control compared with usual office-based care. However, physician visits may be increased using this strategy, at least in the short term.",E,E

There was an overall reduction in events resulting in death or hospital admission, and a year of treatment with carvedilol resulted in the avoidance of one such serious event among every 12-13 (SE 5) of these patients with chronic stable heart failure.",E,E

Blood pressure was measured at the office after 0, 4 and 8 weeks and by 24-h ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) after 0 and 4 weeks. Spontaneously reported adverse events and a subjective symptom assessment questionnaire were used for side-effect profiling.; Mean office systolic/diastolic blood pressure was clinically relevantly reduced in all treatment groups after 4 weeks by 8/7, 12/9, 11/9 and 18/11 mmHg for F2.5, F5, N20 and N40, respectively, and after 8 weeks (F2.5-5: 17/11 mmHg: F5-10: 18/14 mmHg; N20-40: 19/14 mmHg; N40-80: 25/14 mmHg) with no statistically significant differences between these groups. The lowest dose of felodipine (F2.5) was the least effective.

No statistically significant difference between these groups was found. An office responder does not appear to be identical to an ambulatory one and vice versa. The adverse events, mostly oedema, flushing and headache, were dose-related.; Both felodipine ER and nifedipine Retard are effective ""add-on' drugs in patients with monotherapy-resistant hypertension. The blood-pressure-lowering effect is dose-dependent and tolerability is inversely related to efficacy. The results emphasize the benefits of combining two agents with low doses.",E,E

The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) provides an excellent opportunity for examination of sexual function and effects of treatment on sexual function in men and women with stage I diastolic hypertension because of the number of drug classes studied, the double-blind study design, and the long-term follow-up. TOMHS was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 902 hypertensive individuals (557 men, 345 women), aged 45 to 69 years, treated with placebo or one of five active drugs (acebutolol, amlodipine maleate, chlorthalidone, doxazosin maleate, or enalapril maleate). All participants received intensive lifestyle counseling regarding weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, alcohol reduction (for current drinkers), and increased physical activity. Sexual function was ascertained by physician interviews at baseline and annually during follow-up. At baseline, 14.4% of men and 4.9% of women reported a problems with sexual function. In men, 12.2% had problems obtaining and/or maintaining an erection; 2.0% of women reported a problem having an orgasm. Erection problems in men at baseline were positively related to age, systolic pressure, and previous antihypertensive drug use. The incidences of erection dysfunction during follow-up in men were 9.5% and 14.7% through 24 and 48 months, respectively, and were related to type of antihypertensive therapy. Participants randomized to chlorthalidone reported a significantly higher incidence of erection problems through 24 months than participants randomized to placebo (17.1% versus 8.1%, P = .025). Incidence rates through 48 months were more similar among treatment groups than at 24 months, with nonsignificant differences between the chlorthalidone and placebo groups. Incidence was lowest in the doxazosin group but was not significantly different from the placebo group. Incidence for acebutolol, amlodipine, and enalapril groups was similar to that in the placebo group. In many cases, erection dysfunction did not require withdrawal of medication. Disappearance of erection problems among men with problems at baseline was common in all groups but greatest in the doxazosin group. Incidence of reported sexual problems in women was low in all treatment groups. In conclusion, long-term incidence of erection problems in treated hypertensive men is relatively low but is higher with chlorthalidone treatment. Effects of erection dysfunction with chlorthalidone appear relatively early and are often tolerable, and new occurrences after 2 years are unlikely. The rate of reported sexual problems in hypertensive women is low and does not appear to differ by type of drug. Similar incidence rates of erection dysfunction in placebo and most active drug groups caution against routine attribution of erection problems to antihypertensive medication.",I,E

The study had a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design with 6 weeks' metoprolol treatment (100 mg b.i.d) vs. placebo. At the end of each treatment period 24-h blood samples were collected continuously for diurnal analysis of hormone levels and a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp combined with [3-3H]-D-glucose infusion was performed. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated by means of three different methods: diurnal plasma insulin and glucose levels; glucose consumption; and insulin sensitivity index during euglycaemic clamp conditions. Fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations as well as mean plasma diurnal levels of insulin, growth hormone, testosterone and cortisol were similar after placebo and metoprolol treatment, whereas noradrenaline and adrenaline levels were significantly increased after metoprolol. During the clamp, plasma insulin was significantly higher after metoprolol treatment than after placebo treatment (56 +/- 3 vs. 64 +/- 2 mU L(-1), P < 0.05). Consequently, the insulin sensitivity index [glucose infusion rate (GIR)/ plasma insulin] was lower after metoprolol treatment (16.1 +/- 2.6 vs. 10.2 +/- 1.2, P < 0.05), although GIR was not significantly changed. We suggest that the insulin sensitivity index may not accurately reflect the insulin effect as the plasma level of insulin was significantly increased during insulin infusion but not at 24 h, possibly because of alteration of distribution and/or degradation rate of exogenous insulin. Thus, the likelihood of metoprolol inducing insulin resistance in hypertensive subjects may be less than previously proposed.",E,E

Female patients had higher HDL cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels than male patients, but higher platelet counts and signs of enhanced platelet activity (beta-thromboglobulin excretion). In addition, female patients had lower white blood cell counts, suggesting lesser inflammatory activity.; Patients with stable angina pectoris have signs of markedly disturbed fibrinolysis both at rest and in response to exercise, as well as signs of enhanced inflammatory activity and dyslipidemia.

For the meta-analysis, we chose placebo-controlled randomized trials. For randomized trials using surrogate end points such as blood pressure, we selected the largest studies that evaluated multiple drugs. Where clinical trial evidence was lacking, we relied on information from observational studies.; Diuretics and beta-blockers have been evaluated in 18 long-term randomized trials. Compared with placebo, beta-blocker therapy was effective in preventing stroke (relative risk [RR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.86) and congestive heart failure (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40-0.84). The findings were similar for high-dose diuretic therapy (for stroke, RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39-0.62; and for congestive heart failure, RR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.07-0.41).

Although calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients, the clinical trial evidence in terms of health outcomes is meager. For several short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, the available evidence suggests the possibility of harm. Whether the long-acting formulations and the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are safe and prevent major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension remains untested and therefore unknown.; Until the results of large long-term clinical trials evaluating the effects of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular disease incidence are completed, the available scientific evidence provides strong support for the current national guidelines, which recommend diuretics and beta-blockers as firstline agents and low-dose therapy for all antihypertensive agents.",I,8

In doubtamine-atropine stress echocardiography, we evaluated: dobutamine time (i.e. the time from initiation of the dobutamine infusion to obvious dyssynergy), wall motion score index (in a 16-segment model of the left ventricle, each segment ranging from 1 = normal, to 4 = dyskinetic), and rate-pressure product at peak stress.; Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography positivity occurred in 26 out of 26 patients off and in 23 patients on therapy (100 vs 88%, P = ns). Atropine coadministration was needed to evoke echo positivity in no patient off and in five out of 26 on therapy (0 vs 19% P < 0.01).

The sympathetic nervous system is markedly activated in heart failure, and inhibition of this system with the beta-adrenergic blocking agents may provide further benefit. Several clinical trials involving over 3,000 patients have shown that beta-blocker therapy improves left ventricular function in patients with heart failure. However, the effects of such therapy on symptoms and exercise tolerance have been variable. Recent reports have suggested that survival is improved with the beta-blocker carvedilol.

They augment ejection fraction, reduce heart volume, and consistently lower neurohormonal activation as reflected by plasma norepinephrine levels. Trials with carvedilol and bisoprolol suggest an effect on mortality similar to that with converting enzyme inhibitor trials.

Moreover, in individuals with diabetic nephropathy, antihypertensive agents that provide sustained reductions in proteinuria slow the rate of decline in renal function compared with agents without this antiproteinuric effect. To examine whether differential effects on proteinuria affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy, we conducted a randomized study that compared the effects of a heart rate-lowering calcium channel blocker, sustained-release verapamil, with those of a beta-blocker, atenolol, on the progression of diabetic renal disease. The primary end point of the study was a change in creatinine clearance slope. Thirty-four African Americans with the following inclusion criteria were randomized to one of the two groups: serum creatinine greater than 1.4 mg/dL, proteinuria greater than 1500 mg/d, longer than a 5-year history of both non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and exclusion of other renal diseases. Goal blood pressure was less than 140/90 mm Hg. All subjects received loop diuretics as second line agents to help achieve the blood pressure goal. Twenty-four-hour urinary protein and sodium excretions as well as creatinine clearance were measured at 6-month intervals. Blood pressure was measured every 3 months. After a mean follow-up of 54+/-6 months, the calcium channel blocker group demonstrated both a slower rate of decline in creatinine clearance (-1.7+/-0.9 versus -3.7+/-1.4 mL/min per year per 1.73 m2, P<.01) and a greater reduction in proteinuria compared with the atenolol group. Additionally, a greater proportion of the atenolol group had a 50% or more increase in serum creatinine compared with the verapamil group (32+/-9% versus 16+/-7%, P<.05). These between-group differences could not be explained by differences in blood pressure control. These data support the concept that antihypertensive agents that persistently maintain reductions in both arterial pressure and proteinuria slow the progression of diabetic renal disease in African Americans to a greater extent than those agents without these effects.",E,E

Fifty patients experienced major cardiac events. Cox analysis revealed that MFVP was a strong predictor of events and that the response to loading manipulations improved its prognostic value. Patients with an irreversible restrictive MFVP had a higher event rate (51%) than patients with a reversible restrictive MFVP (19%). Among patients with a baseline nonrestrictive MFVP, those with a stable nonrestrictive MFVP had the lowest event rate (6%), whereas the event rate was 33% in patients with an unstable nonrestrictive MFVP.; In patients with chronic heart failure, MFVPs provide independent prognostic information. Their prognostic value can be further increased by assessment of the changes induced in them by loading manipulations.",E,E

Experimental studies showed that captopril administration reduces ET-1 secretion. In addition, it was reported that the increased ET-1 levels are a negative prognostic index. The study sought to verify whether captopril can reduce plasma ET levels in the acute and subacute phases of reperfused anterior AMI. Forty-five patients, hospitalized for suspected anterior AMI within 4 h from the onset of symptoms, suitable for thrombolysis (first episode), Killip class I-2, were randomized (double blind) into two groups: group A (23; seven women/16 men) received captopril (as first dose) 2-4 h after starting thrombolysis (the dose was then increased up to 25 mg every 8 h). Group B (22; five women/17 men) received placebo after thrombolysis. All the patients met the reperfusion criteria. The two groups were similar with regard to age, sex, CK peak, ejection fraction, end-systolic volume and risk factors. Plasma ET levels were measured at entry, and 2, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after starting thrombolysis. Mean concentrations of ET +/- SD: Group A basal, 1.50 +/- 0.67; at 2h, 2.31 +/- 1.24; 12 h, 1.84 +/- 1.45; 24 h, 1.30 +/- 0.72; 48 h, o.95 +/- 0.50; 72 h, 0.60 +/- 0.15 fmol/ml; p < 0.001. Group B basal, 1.58 +/- 0.83; at 2 h, 2.38 +/- 1.35; 12 h, 2.33 +/- 1.71; 24 h, 1.80 +/- 1.41; 48h, 1.46 +/- 0.88; 72 h, 0.93 +/- 0.44 fmol/ml; p < 0.001. Difference between the two groups was significant at the beginning of the test (between 2 and 12 h, p[=]0.002). After that, the values of the plasma endothelin decreased in parallel, p < 0.001. Our data suggest that captopril affects plasma ET levels in the acute and subacute phases of AMI. Moreover, these results provide additional evidence for a beneficial effect of early captopril treatment.",E,E

We assessed whether this association was also true for long-acting calcium antagonists.; We did a case-control study, which was nested within a systematic hypertension control programme for a prospective cohort of 4350 people (first seen 1981-94). Cases (n = 189) were hypertensive patients who had had a first cardiovascular event, including all cardiovascular deaths and hospitalisations, between 1989 and 1995. Controls (n = 189) were individually matched to cases for sex, ethnic origin, age, type of previous antihypertensive treatment, year of entry into the study, and length of follow-up. We collected data on any prescribed drug regimen that was being taken on the event data for cases and on the same date for matched controls. Calcium antagonists were classified by duration of action.; Compared with those on beta-blocker monotherapy, patients on long-acting calcium antagonists (n = 136) had no increased risk of a cardiovascular event (adjusted odds ratio 0.76 [95% CI 0.41-1.43]), whereas patients on short-acting calcium antagonists (n = 27) were at significantly greater risk (adjusted odds ratio 3.88 [1.15-13.11], p = 0.029). Among 38 matched pairs who were both on calcium antagonists, the adjusted risk ratio for short-acting versus long-acting was 8.56 (1.88-38.97), p < 0.01.; Long-acting and short-acting calcium antagonists differ in cardiovascular outcomes. Consistent with earlier findings, the use of short-acting calcium antagonists was associated with increased risk of a cardiovascular event. This finding highlights the need to complete on-going clinical trials so that the relative cardiovascular impact of various antihypertensive agents can be assessed.",E,E
9067912,A short-term antihypertensive treatment-induced fall in glomerular filtration rate predicts long-term stability of renal function.,Adult; Antihypertensive Agents; Atenolol; Double-Blind Method; Enalapril; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Hypertension; Kidney; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Time Factors,"Apperloo, A J; de Zeeuw, D; de Jong, P E","In long-term intervention studies on renal function outcome an initial decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may occur after starting therapy. If this initial GFR decline is the result of a treatment-induced hemodynamic change reflecting a fall in intraglomerular pressure, it should be reversible after treatment withdrawal, even after long-term treatment. In fact, it could be beneficial for renal function in the long term. We therefore studied systemic and renal hemodynamics in 40 non-diabetic patients with impaired renal function before treatment, during four years treatment with either atenolol or enalapril, and after withdrawal of that treatment. The acute change in GFR 12 weeks after start of treatment varied widely from -11 to + 11 ml/min (mean +/- SD -1.0 +/- 4.1 ml/min, NS). After four years of treatment, withdrawal for 12 weeks resulted in a rise in GFR of +2.2 +/- 5.4 ml/min, P = 0.011, again with a wide range of +14 to -6 ml/min). The initial fall in GFR was related to the rise after withdrawal (r = 0.32, P < 0.05). Interestingly, the acute treatment induced change in GFR correlated with the long-term slope, such that a patient with a greater initial decline in GFR showed a more stable course during the follow up (r = -0.36, P < 0.05). The patients were arbitrarily divided in group A (N = 20), with the largest initial treatment-induced fall in GFR, and group B (N = 20), with the smallest initial fall in GFR. Group A had a significantly less steep slope than group B (-0.41 +/- 1.52 vs. -2.09 +/- 2.79 ml/min/year, P = 0.023) during the four year follow-up. In group A GFR increased again after withdrawal of treatment (+3.8 +/- 5.6 ml/min, P = 0.011) whereas it did not change in group B (+0.5 +/- 4.0 ml/min, NS). As a consequence, GFR post-treatment was not different compared to pre-treatment in group A (-2.5 +/- 7.2 ml/min, NS), whereas it was 5.9 +/- 12.1 ml/min lower in group B (P = 0.023). Patients treated with enalapril had a similar response as patients treated with atenolol. In conclusion, an initial fall in GFR after starting antihypertensive treatment in patients with a mild to moderate renal function impairment (GFR 30 to 90 ml/min) is reversible even after years of treatment, suggesting that this therapy-induced fall is of hemodynamic and not of structural origin. This initial GFR fall was associated with a subsequent stable renal function. These data lead to the hypothesis that the initial fall in GFR in response to antihypertensive therapy reflects renal protection.",E,E

The placebo group consisted of 14 patients with chronic ischaemic heart disease and the same stage of PAOD.; Patients on 50 mg/day atenolol showed a significant reduction in both pain-free and maximal walking range compared with the controls. In contrast, those taking 200 mg/day celiprolol and those on 80 mg/day isosorbide dinitrate demonstrated significant increases in pain-free and maximal, walking distance compared with the control group. The colour duplex sonographically measured Doppler flow through the femoral artery showed a significant decrease both in the patients taking celiprolol and in those on isosorbide dinitrate, while in those receiving atenolol the resistance index increased significantly.; The study shows that the beta-adrenoceptor blocker celiprolol also possesses a nitrate-like vasodilatory property and can be used in patients with chronic ischaemic heart disease and impaired peripheral arterial blood flow.",1,E

They speculated that it might be possible to reverse this decrease in blood flow by using agents with peripheral vasodilating properties. They chose the calcium channel blocking agent isradipine as a prototype. As a contrast agent, they chose atenolol, which has an equivalent antihypertensive effect but minimal peripheral vasodilating properties. They studied 24 diabetic hypertensive patients in a randomized, two-way crossover design. They assigned patients randomly to one or the other active drug and titrated to a maximum tolerated maintenance dose. Skin blood flow was measured at the end of the titration and maintenance phases. Patients then entered a four-week washout period, followed by crossover to the alternative drug, and measurements were repeated. At baseline, the twenty-four-hour mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure was 150 +/- 2 mm Hg with a twenty-four-hour mean diastolic blood pressure of 93 +/- 1 mm Hg. Thermally stimulated skin blood flow reserve was about 50% lower in these patients as compared with an age-, sex-, and weight-matched group of 28 nondiabetic, nonhypertensive patients. There was no difference in skin blood flow between the two groups at basal skin temperature or at a controlled temperature of 35 degrees C. Both atenolol and isradipine successfully lowered blood pressure in the study patients. There was a slightly greater decrease in systolic blood pressure with isradipine and a greater decrease in heart rate with atenolol. Neither isradipine nor atenolol treatment affected skin blood flow values at the maximal 44 degrees C temperature. However, at basal skin temperature and at 35 degrees C, isradipine-treated patients had substantial increases in skin blood flow at NUTR sites. For example, skin blood flow at the knee at 35 degrees C with isradipine treatment was 3.1 +/- 0.4 mL/min/100 g compared with 1.1 +/- 0.2 with atenolol, 1.3 +/- 0.1 with placebo, and 0.9 +/- 0.1 for the nondiabetic controls (all P < 0.01). The authors found a twofold to threefold increase in basal skin blood flow at NUTR sites with isradipine treatment. This degree of increase is substantially greater than that previously demonstrated by their group using pentoxifylline. Locally reduced skin blood flow is a factor in promoting skin breakdown and delayed healing. Further study is needed to explore the possibility that isradipine treatment may enhance healing of diabetic skin ulcers.",E,E

Esmolol administration may enhance patient comfort.; Sixty consecutive patients who experienced minor side-effects during dobutamine stress echocardiography were given 0.3 mg/kg esmolol intravenously in the recovery period and compared retrospectively to sixty consecutive controls who underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography, who did not receive esmolol, during the same time period. Both groups were matched for age, ejection fraction, and peak dose of dobutamine. Heart rate and blood pressure were assessed during and after dobutamine administration.; Both groups had similar baseline blood pressure (mmHg) (142 +/- 19/72 +/- 14 vs 139 +/- 20/72 +/- 14) and heart rate (beats per minute) (75 +/- 14 vs 75 +/- 17) (esmolol and control respectively, p = ns), but peak heart rate was higher in the esmolol group (126 +/- 14 vs. 116 +/- 14, p < 0.01). In the group who received esmolol, symptomatic relief paralleled the statistically significant decrease in heart rate which occurred within 1 minute of esmolol administration (99.7 +/- 15.3 vs 108.5 +/- 13.1 p < 0.0001); the heart rate in the esmolol group remained significantly lower than the control group for 5 minutes following esmolol administration (92.0 +/- 10.3 vs 96.7 +/- 11.8 p < 0.05). As a percentage of peak heart rate the esmolol group remained significantly lower than the control for 7 minutes (74% vs 80% p < 0.05). Esmolol induced a significant reversal of dobutamine-induced diastolic hypotension (diastolic blood pressure at peak 66 +/- 17 vs 8 min recovery 70 +/- 12, p < 0.03) that was not seen in controls (diastolic blood pressure at peak 64 +/- 18 vs 8 min recovery 65 +/- 14, p = ns). Systolic blood pressure and heart rate remained elevated in both groups 8 min into recovery compared to baseline, suggesting persistent dobutamine effect beyond the expected 2 min pharmacologic half-life of dobutamine. No side-effects from esmolol were seen despite it being used in 9 patients with EF < 35%.; Esmolol is effective and well tolerated for the management of dobutamine-related minor side-effects. The mechanism of benefit, in addition to heart rate reduction, may involve a reversal of dobutamine-induced diastolic hypotension. Blood pressure and heart rate recovery are slower than expected from previously published pharmacokinetic data.",E,E

To assess the relationship of lifestyle factors and change in lifestyle factors to QL in participants with stage I diastolic hypertension.; The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with minimum participant follow-up of 4 years. It was conducted at 4 hypertension screening and treatment academic centers in the United States. The cohort consisted of 902 men and women with hypertension, aged 45 to 69 years, with diastolic blood pressures less than 100 mm Hg. Informed consent was obtained from each participant after the nature of the procedures had been fully explained. Sustained nutritional-hygienic intervention was administered to all participants to reduce weight, to reduce dietary sodium and alcohol intake, and to increase physical activity. Participants were randomized to take (1) acebutolol (n = 132); (2) amlodipine maleate (n = 131); (3) chlorthalidone (n = 126); (4) doxazosin mesylate (n = 134); (5) enalapril maleate (n = 135); or placebo (n = 234).

Improvements in QL were observed in all randomized groups, including the placebo group during follow-up; greater improvements were observed in the acebutolol and chlorthalidone groups and were evident throughout follow-up. The amount of weight loss, increase in physical activity, and level of attained blood pressure control during follow-up were related to greater improvements in QL.; In patients with stage I hypertension, antihypertensive treatment with any of 5 agents used in TOMHS does not impair QL. The diuretic chlorthali-done and the cardioselective beta-blocker acebutolol appear to improve QL the most. Success with lifestyle changes affecting weight loss and increase in physical activity relate to greater improvements in QL and show that these interventions, in addition to contributing to blood pressure control, have positive effects on the general well-being of the individual.",E,E

Two hundred sixty-seven patients were randomized, 84 to timolol, 89 to latanoprost in the morning for 3 months and then in the evening for another 3 months, and 94 to latanoprost with the treatment schedule reversed.; After 6 months, timolol reduced diurnal IOP from 24.6 to 17.9 mmHg (27%); latanoprost applied in the morning, from 25.5 to 17.7 mmHg (31%); and latanoprost applied in the evening, from 24.8 to 16.2 mmHg (35%). The efficacy of latanoprost applied in the evening was statistically superior to latanoprost applied in the morning and to timolol (P < 0.001). Latanoprost induced a slight increase in conjunctival hyperemia in 31.4% of treated patients, compared with 15.9% for timolol. Sporadic episodes of mild punctate corneal epithelial erosions were three times as frequent in latanoprost-treated eyes as in timolol-treated eyes.

Acute myocardial ischemia superimposed upon ventricles damaged from previous infarctions has been demonstrated to enhance the generation of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. This is a retrospective analysis of 6,797 participants in the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction prevention and treatment trials. Both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards modeling were used to study the association of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy with the risk for sudden cardiac death. The following covariates were adjusted for in the analysis: age, ejection fraction, gender, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, a history of angina, prior infarction, prior revascularization, and the regular use of beta blockers, diuretics, digoxin, antiarrhythmic agents, or enalapril. The overall incidence of sudden cardiac death per 100 patient-years of follow-up was 2.24%. In multivariate analysis, antiplatelet and anticoagulant monotherapy each remained independently associated with a reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death: antiplatelet therapy with a 24% reduction (relative risk [RR] 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.95) and antiplatelet monotherapy with a 32% reduction (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.48-0.96).

Patients were followed up for a median of 14 (IQR 8-25) months and 13 (8-25) months, respectively. In 31 (51%) of the shunted patients, simultaneous transjugular-variceal embolisation was done at the time of shunt placement. Endoscopic treatment consisted of sclerotherapy and/or banding ligation and was combined with propranolol medication.; Technical success was achieved in all patients assigned to the shunt group. During follow-up, the cumulative 1-year variceal rebleeding rates in the shunted and endoscopically treated patients were 15% and 41% and the 2-year rates were 21% and 52% (p = 0.001), respectively.

On the basis of such a hypothesis, and apart from the inhibition of the renin angiotensin system, the antagonism of beta-receptors has evolved as a promising approach for improving quality of life and prognosis. However, the definite proof of beta-adrenoceptor blockade induced benefit on survival remains to be demonstrated. On the basis of CIBIS I data, the objective of the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II (CIBIS II) is to evaluate effects of the selective beta-1 adrenoceptor blocker, bisoprolol, on mortality (primary endpoint) in patients with ischaemic or non-ischaemic chronic heart failure. Eligible patients will be symptomatic ambulatory patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 35% in NYHA functional class III or IV, receiving a background treatment of diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. A total of 2,500 patients are planned to be included with a mean follow up of at least 3 years. Secondary endpoints include hospitalisations, cardiovascular mortality and combination of both as well as permanent treatment withdrawal. Bisoprolol will be titrated up to 10 mg, starting with 1.25 mg daily. Randomization began in November 1995. CIBIS II results will represent a basis for definite conclusions on the evaluation of beta-adrenoceptor blockade induced benefit with bisoprolol in chronic heart failure.",I,I

This article focuses on the effect of these 2 drug classes on the incidence of sudden death. Numerous studies have shown that thiazide diuretics have a strong, dosage-dependent potassium-depleting effect, and it has been postulated that this may explain why the reduction in risk of coronary heart disease, observed in hypertension trials, was less pronounced than expected. In 7 trials that included sudden death as an end-point; a pooled risk-ratio of sudden death of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.0) was observed when non-potassium-sparing diuretics were compared with placebo. Two recent case-control studies have also strongly indicated that the use of thiazides increases the risk of sudden death. Evidence from trials using potassium-sparing diuretic combinations suggests that these may be better tolerated than thiazide monotherapy. Although it was suggested in the 2 recent case-control studies that recipients of beta-blockers are also at an increased risk of sudden death, further studies are required to confirm this finding, particularly since these drugs have several well-documented cardioprotective effects.",I,8

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 39 physically active men with uncomplicated essential hypertension, we compared the effects of atenolol and enalapril on cardiovascular fitness and serum lipids. Drugs (atenolol, 50 or 100 mg once daily; enalapril, 10 or 20 mg once daily) were each administered for 4 weeks and each active drug period was preceded by 4 weeks of placebo therapy. Both drugs effectively (p < 0.001) lowered resting blood pressure when measured at the time of theoretical peak (i.e., 3 to 4 hours postdrug) and trough (i.e., 24 hours postdrug) drug blood levels. Atenolol reduced maximal oxygen uptake (by 7.3%, p < 0.001) 3 to 4, but not 24, hours after drug ingestion; no changes occurred with enalapril. Similarly, whereas serum lipids were essentially unchanged with enalapril, serum triglycerides (18.9% increase), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (10.6% decrease), and ratio of low-density to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (15.4% increase) were adversely impacted (p < or = 0.05) with atenolol.

However, the effects of such treatment on left ventricular size remain uncertain.; One hundred twenty-three patients from 10 centers in New Zealand and Australia participated in the 2D echocardiographic substudy. Echocardiography was performed before randomization and was repeated after 6 and 12 months of treatment. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were measured from apical four- and two-chamber views with the use of a modified Simpson's rule method.; After 12 months, heart rate was 8 beats/min lower in the carvedilol than in the placebo group, whereas left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were increased in the placebo group but reduced in the carvedilol group. At 12 months, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was 14 ml/m2 less in the carvedilol than in the placebo group (p = 0.0015); left ventricular end-systolic volume index was 15.3 ml/m2 less (p = 0.0001), and left ventricular ejection fraction was 5.8% greater (p = 0.0015).; In patients with heart failure due to ischemic heart disease, carvedilol therapy for 12 months reduced left ventricular volumes, increased left ventricular ejection fraction and prevented progressive left ventricular dilation. These changes demonstrate a beneficial effect of carvedilol on left ventricular remodeling in heart failure. The observed changes may explain in part the improved clinical outcomes produced by treatment with carvedilol.",E,E

In particular, data on mortality were sought from all randomized patients for the scheduled treatment period. The typical effect of treatment on mortality was estimated from an overview in which the results of all individual trials were combined using standard statistical methods. Twenty-four randomized trials, involving 3141 patients with stable congestive heart failure were identified. Complete data on mortality were obtained from all studies, and a total of 297 deaths were documented during an average of 13 months of follow-up. Overall, there was a 31% reduction in the odds of death among patients assigned a beta-blocker (95% confidence interval 11 to 46%, 2P = 0.0035), representing an absolute reduction in mean annual mortality from 9.7% to 7.5%. The effects on mortality of vasodilating beta-blockers (47% reduction SD 15), principally carvedilol, were non-significantly greater (2P = 0.09) than those of standard agents (18% reduction SD 15), principally metoprolol.; Beta-blocker therapy is likely to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure.

We found a coincidence of increased early postoperative venous pressures (CVP; 17.1 +/- 2.9 mm Hg) with relatively high cardiac indices (3.6 +/- 0.6 l/min.m-2) as compared to 2.4 l/min.m-2 in the group of patients with a symptom-free long-term course but no significant difference in total pulmonary resistance between the two groups. The increased CVP (17.2 +/- 2.9 mm Hg) in patients with late chronic central venous congestion is primarily due to increased total pulmonary resistance (552 +/- 131 dyn s/cm5.m-2). Both groups of patients with central venous congestion display a ratio of systemic to total pulmonary resistance lower than 4.5 whereas symptom-free patients have a significantly higher resistance ratio (6.8 +/- 2.3) and a highly significant increase in peripheral resistance to values of 2687 +/- 527 dyn s/cm5.m-2 as compared to 1486 +/- 340 dyn s/cm5.m-2 in the early postoperative group. Correspondingly, mean arterial pressure of the symptom-free patients is significantly elevated (93 +/- 11 mm Hg) as compared to a control group (81 +/- 11 mm Hg). Based on our theory an increase in systemic arterial resistance may lead to a fall in mean capillary filtration pressure and therefore counteract central venous congestion. To support this, we briefly present cases where pharmacologic enhancement of systemic arterial resistance was effective in the treatment of venous congestion whereas pharmacologic lowering of systemic resistance induced venous congestion.",1,E

We excluded trials that did not include placebo treatment during the active phase of the study. The trials were reviewed and rated for scientific rigor using a 5-point scale (scientific score [ss]; 1 = low, 5 = good), blinded to the physicians' utilization data and cost of the drugs.

Analysis was based on seven trials from the INDANA (INdividual Data ANalysis of Antihypertensive intervention trials) database and was adjusted for possible confounders.; 20,802 women and 19,975 men recruited between 1972 and 1990.; Primarily beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics.; In women, treatment effect was statistically significant for stroke (fatal strokes and all strokes) and for major cardiovascular events. In men, it was statistically significant for all categories of events (total and specific mortality, all coronary events, all strokes, and major cardiovascular events). The odds ratios for any category of event did not differ significantly between men and women. In absolute terms, the benefit in women was seen primarily for strokes; in men, treatment prevented as many coronary events as strokes. Graphical analyses suggest that these results could be completely explained by the difference in untreated risk.; In terms of relative risk, treatment benefit did not differ between women and men. The absolute risk reduction attributable to treatment seemed to depend on untreated risk. These findings underline the need to predict accurately the untreated cardiovascular risk of an individual person in order to rationalize and individualize antihypertensive treatment.",I,E

In a meta-analysis of 14 of the major primary prevention trials in hypertension, the difference in diastolic blood pressure between the intervention groups and the control groups was only 5-6 mmHg. This difference was associated with significant reductions in all stroke events (42 per cent), all coronary heart disease events (14 per cent) and in cardiovascular mortality (21 per cent). In elderly hypertensive patients, available studies have shown that antihypertensive treatment reduces the incidence of non-fatal cardiovascular events without significantly modifying cardiovascular mortality. Most of these results were obtained with beta-blockers or diuretics. Despite official recommendation as first line monotherapy, none of the three new antihypertensive classes has been shown to have beneficial effects on hard primary endpoints such as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Several ongoing large scale randomized controlled trials vs. beta-blockers or diuretics are addressing this important issue. Moreover, other effects of antihypertensive treatment such as the 'J-curve phenomenon', the rate of change in the carotid wall thickness or the exact beneficial effects in elderly patients are being investigated in some of these studies.",E,E

SAH should be considered as a possible cause of all sudden and/or unusual headaches, and every attempt should be made to recognize mild SAHs, as they are still frequently misdiagnosed. The first test for SAH is computed tomography (CT), followed by lumbar puncture when the CT is negative for intracranial bleeding (the case in only several per cent of patients within 24 hours of aneurysm bleeding). Urgent cerebral angiography is necessary to detect the underlying cerebral aneurysm. The advantage of rapid diagnosis of SAH followed by early aneurysm repair is minimizing the risk of catastrophic aneurysm rebleeding. Early surgery for aneurysm repair is often possible and is recommended, unless the aneurysm location or size renders it technically difficult to expose in clot-laden subarachnoid cisterns beneath an acutely swollen brain. Aneurysm ablation is optimally accomplished with open microsurgery and clipping of the aneurysm neck, although other options include proximal parent artery occlusion, ""trapping"" of the aneurysmal segment of the artery, and embolization of thrombogenic materials (e.g., platinum ""microcoils"") directly into the aneurysm dome using endovascular techniques. Neurological outcome following SAH is also optimized through the prevention of secondary SAH complications, and further management specific for ruptured cerebral aneurysms can include anticonvulsants, neuroprotectants, and various agents and techniques to prevent or reverse delayed-onset cerebral vasospasm. All patients with aneurysmal SAH should be treated with the calcium antagonist nimodipine, and in certain circumstances patients should receive anticonvulsants. Induced arterial hypertension, hypervolemia and in some instances percutaneous balloon angioplasty are recommended to reverse vasospasm causing symptomatic cerebral ischemia prior to cerebral infarction.",E,E

They are usually measured by radioimmunoassay after extraction and concentration. An additional high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) step is reportedly necessary for accurate measurement but it is laborious and time-consuming, severely limiting the number of samples that can be assayed.; To investigate whether the HPLC step was necessary for measuring Ang II in human plasma samples in our laboratory using our own Ang II antiserum.; Human plasma Ang II levels, measured with and without the HPLC step, were compared in two different studies. Since the action of renin is the rate-limiting step in the production of Ang II in plasma, the relationships of plasma renin activity (PRA) to Ang II levels measured with and without HPLC were also evaluated. In the first study, 108 blood samples were collected from 29 hypertensive patients during placebo or treatment with the Ang II antagonist BMS-186295. In the second study blood samples were collected from 12 normal subjects before and during beta-adrenergic blockade.; In samples collected during angiotensin II antagonism, which predictably increased plasma Ang II levels, a highly significant relationship between the Ang II measurements with and without HPLC was found (y = 0.99x + 1.7; r = 0.97, P < 0.001). The y intercept of 1.7 pg/ml suggested that the nonspecific immunoreactivity was close to 2 pg/ml in samples assayed without the HPLC step. During beta-adrenergic blockade, which predictably suppressed plasma renin levels, highly significantly linear relationships between HPLC and non-HPLC Ang II measurements (y = 1.3x + 1.6; r = 0.93. P < 0.001, n = 16) and between non HPLC Ang II and PRA (y = 1.9x + 1.7; r = 0.73, P < 0.001, n = 108) were again found. The relationship between PRA and HPLC Ang II was also highly significant (y = 1.4x + 0.04; r = 0.92, P < 0.001, n = 16), but the y intercept was significantly lower (P < 0.001), approaching zero, indicating the removal of nonspecific immunoreactivity during the HPLC step.; These results demonstrate once more that, when using polyclonal antibody 182, the accuracy of the Ang II measurement in human plasma is improved by the inclusion of a HPLC step, especially for samples with Ang II levels in the normal-to-low range. They also show that plasma Ang II and PRA increase or decrease proportionally during treatment with Ang II antagonists or beta-adrenergic blockade, respectively.",E,E

During a median follow-up time of 3.2 years (2132 patient-years), 32 patients suffered a CV death, 21 had a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and 77 underwent revascularization. Plasma levels of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) activity and antigen (ag), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activity at test, and TPA responses to exercise were determined at baseline and after 1 month's treatment and were related to subsequent fatal and nonfatal CV events. Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that elevated levels of TPA-ag at rest (P < .05), high PAI-1 activity (P < .05), and low TPA-ag responses to exercise (P < .05) were associated with increased risk of subsequent CV death. After adjustment for baseline risk factors, TPA-ag independently predicted CV death or MI. In addition, PAI-1 activity independently predicted CV death or MI in male patients. Verapamil treatment was associated with a 10% decrease of TPA-ag levels and metoprolol treatment with a 2% increase (P < .001 for treatment difference).; Plasma TPA-ag levels at rest, and among male patients PAI-1 activity as well, independently predict subsequent CV death or MI in patients with stable angina pectoris.",I,E

Of 313 patients enrolled, 248 were randomized and 212 completed the study according to the protocol.; The primary variable TET was analysed using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model to take into account censored values due to the patient stopping the exercise test for reasons other than angina. Forty-three per cent of patients allocated to carvedilol and 36% to verapamil did not stop with angina at the final visit. There was no difference in the TET between the groups, the risk ratio being 1.14 in favour of carvedilol (90% CI 0.85-1.52). TET increased from 378 s at baseline to 436 s at the final visit in the carvedilol group and from 386 to 438 s in the verapamil group. Results for time to angina and time to 1 mm ST-segment depression were similar. Compared to verapamil, carvedilol significantly reduced HR, systolic BP and rate pressure product at peak exercise.

Since antihypertensive drugs of differing types may exhibit markedly different abilities to modulate LVH, we examined the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril, and the potassium channel activator minoxidil, alone or in combination with each other, on the left ventricular mass (LVM) in patients with severe essential hypertension who had LVH detected by echocardiography. All patients received the same base therapy of bopindolol and guanfacine. After a run-in period, they were treated with: (1) cilazapril (n = 10); (2) minoxidil, combined with a diuretic (n = 10); or (3) both cilazapril and monoxidil (n = 6) for 12 months. The LVM index (LVMI; LVM per body surface area) was estimated every 3 months by means of echocardiography. Each kind of therapy decreased the arterial pressures to a similar degree. The 1-year treatment with the cilazapril-based regimen resulted in a significantly diminished LVMI (from a mean +/- s.d. of 173 +/- 38 to 152 +/- 22 g/m2; P < 0.05). On the other hand, the minoxidil-based therapy led to a significant increase in LVMI (from 148 +/- 19 to 170 +/- 35 g/m2; P < 0.05). There were no significant LVMI changes in patients receiving the combined, cilazapril + minoxidil-based treatment (172 +/- 34 vs the pretreatment 183 +/- 54 g/m2). The results confirm that long-term treatment with cilazapril is effective both in reducing BP and in reducing LVM. In spite of yielding a satisfactory reduction of BP, minoxidil therapy, even in combination with a diuretic and a beta-blocker, may lead to an aggravation of pre-existing LVH; this effect of minoxidil could be prevented by the simultaneous administration of cilazapril.",E,E

Twenty-seven of 1635 patients (1.7%) satisfying clinical criteria for primary hypertension were found to have developed proteinuria > 1000 mg/24 hours and were removed from the study. Follow-up data were obtained on 19 of these 27 patients. One patient was found to have focal segmental sclerosis and progressed to end-stage renal disease. Three other patients developed severe (serum creatinine > 3.5 mg/dl) chronic renal failure (one with diabetic nephropathy), one progressed from serum creatinine 1.4 to 2.2 mg/dl, but 14 of the 19 remained with stable serum creatinine < 2.0 mg/dl on follow-up for 6-9 years. Data were available for 1076 of 1155 (93%) treated study patients at end titration, 522/600 (87%) at one year and 322/444 (73%) at two years. There were significant associations for proteinuria with obesity and higher systolic blood pressure. There was a trend toward significant difference in mean 24-hour protein excretion rates at baseline between black (127 mg) and white (139 mg) patients (p = 0.07). There were no statistically significant changes in urinary protein excretion/24 hours between or within the different treatment groups (including placebo).

Ten patients with a baseline low-dose dobutamine-echocardiographic test (up to 10 micrograms/kg/min) positive for myocardial viability in > or = 1 segment(s), performed 4-5 days after a first acute myocardial infarction treated with rtPA, were randomized after the administration of intravenous metoprolol (15 mg in three 5-mg boluses) either to dobutamine (up to 15 micrograms/kg/min) or to an enoximone intravenous bolus (1 mg/kg over 5 min) under echocardiographic monitoring, in a crossover sequence, with a 24-h interval. The infarct related artery was patent (TIMI grade 2 o 3) in all the patients. Follow-up echocardiograms were performed 5-7 weeks later. Resting asynergy was found in 40 segments; of these, 17 were viable. All the viable segments remained unresponsive during the post-metoprolol dobutamine infusion, while improved their contractility during enoximone echocardiography. Two patients suffering from early post-infarction angina underwent coronary angioplasty successfully. Eight out of ten patients (2 revascularized and 6 not) showed contractile recovery in a total of 14 segments at the follow-up echocardiogram.

However, in these high-risk patients this thoracic surgery may result in significant morbidity and mortality rates. Similar sympathetic blockade can now be produced with high thoracic epidural analgesia (HTEA). From September 1995 to August 1996, we treated 10 consecutive patients with HTEA. These eight men and two women, aged 58 +/- 5 years, with extensive three-vessel coronary disease and ejection fractions of 40% +/- 5%, had New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV angina despite medical therapy, including nitrates, beta-blockade, calcium channel blockade, and narcotics. HTEA was performed at the T1 through T4 levels with a catheter placed either percutaneously or surgically, with radiographic confirmation of catheter placement with an epidurogram or computed tomography scan. Bupivacaine (0.25% to 0.5%), an amide local anesthetic, was given as a bolus through the epidural catheter and then maintained either as a continuous infusion or an intermittent rebolus. The epidural catheter remained in place for 7 days in four patients, 14 days in three patients, and > or =90 days in three patients. Before consideration for HTEA, each patient was deemed unsuitable for or refused coronary bypass surgery and percutaneous coronary angioplasty and had NYHA class IV symptoms of angina. Seven of 10 patients required intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin and were unable to be discharged from the intensive care unit because of anginal symptoms. Two of these seven patients also required an intraaortic balloon pump for symptom control. After HTEA, all 10 patients had improved symptoms, with five patients improving to NYHA class II symptoms and five improving to NYHA class III. All seven patients receiving intravenous nitroglycerin, heparin, or intraaortic balloon pump support had these modalities discontinued. Six of these seven patients were subsequently discharged from the hospital. One patient died from a non-HTEA related cause. There were no HTEA-related deaths. There were three catheter-related complications necessitating catheter removal during 12 months of HTEA use. Local infection developed in one patient, one had catheter occlusion caused by fibrosis, and one patient had chronic back pain exacerbation from a paraspinous muscle spasm. No patient had a myocardial infarction or a significant arrhythmia. In patients with otherwise intractable angina pectoris, HTEA is an effective modality that produces symptomatic relief of angina pectoris and allows increased activity level.",E,E

We performed a prospective, randomized, parallel study for 42 months, double blind for the first 12 months and single blind thereafter. Forty-three (21 lisinopril and 22 atenolol) hypertensive NIDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy were enrolled. Data from 36 patients (17 lisinopril and 19 atenolol, 60 +/- 7 years of age, 27 men) who completed at least 12 months of the study period are presented. At baseline, the two groups were comparable: glomerular filtration rate (51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance) was 75 +/- 6 and 74 +/- 8 ml x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2), mean 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (A&D TM2420) was 110 +/- 3 and 114 +/- 2 mmHg, and 24-h urinary albumin excretion rate was 961 (range 331-5,727) and 1,578 (476-5,806) mg/24 h in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. The mean follow-up time was similar, 37 and 35 months in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. Mean ambulatory blood pressure was equally reduced in the two groups, 12 +/- 2 and 10 +/- 2 mmHg in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. Glomerular filtration rate declined in a biphasic manner with a faster initial (0 to 6 months) change of 1.25 +/- 0.49 and 0.81 +/- 0.29 ml x min(-1) x month(-1) followed by a slower sustained decline (6 to 42 months) of 0.59 +/- 0.10 and 0.54 +/- 0.13 ml x min(-1) x month(-1) in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. No significant differences were observed in either initial or sustained decline in glomerular filtration rate between the two groups. Urinary albumin excretion was reduced (% reduction of baseline) more in the lisinopril than in the atenolol group, at 55 (95% CI 29-72) and 15% (-13 to 34), respectively (P = 0.01). In conclusion, the relentless decline in kidney function characteristically found in hypertensive NIDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy can be reduced equally effectively by two antihypertensive treatments, the beta-blocker atenolol and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril.",E,E

As beta-adrenoceptor blockers (BB) are often prescribed for obese patients suffering from hypertension or coronary heart disease, this study compares the pharmacokinetics of lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers in obese and control subjects.; Nine obese (157 +/- 24% of ideal body weight (IBW) mean +/- s.d.) and nine non-obese healthy volunteers (98 +/- 10% IBW), aged 32 +/- 9 years, were included in the study. Subjects were randomly given a single i.v. infusion of one of the following racemic beta-adrenoceptor blockers, whose doses (expressed as base per kg of IBW) were: propranolol (0.108 mg), labetalol (0.99 mg) and nebivolol (0.073 mg). The plasma concentrations of unchanged drugs were measured by h.p.l.c. The ionisation constants and lipophilicity parameters of beta-adrenoceptor blockers were assessed.; The pharmacokinetic data for the three drugs were qualitatively similar. There was a trend towards a greater total distribution volume (Vss) in obese patients than in controls. However, Vss expressed per kg body weight was slightly smaller in obese patients. The relationship between Vss and lipophilicity of five beta-adrenoceptor was studied by combining the current results with those previously obtained with a moderately lipophilic drug (bisoprolol) and a hydrophilic one (sotalol). The Vss of the five drugs was positively and well-correlated (r2 = 0.90; P < 0.01) with their distribution coefficient at pH 7.4 (log D7.4), but not with their partition coefficients. The linear regression coefficients for lean and obese subjects were very similar.; Lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers seem to diffuse less into adipose than into lean tissues. All electrical forms of the drugs (i.e. cations, neutral forms, or zwitterions) present at physiological pH contribute to their tissue distribution, in both obese and lean subjects. Their tissue distribution in obese patients could be restricted by the sum of hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bonds they elicit with macromolecules in lean tissues.",E,E

The present article reviews the current role of digitalis in the management of heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AF) in light of recent study findings. Generally, first-line therapy for the management of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction should include an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic. In patients who remain symptomatic despite the use of these drugs, the addition of digoxin should be considered. Because digoxin has been shown to reduce the number of hospital admissions attributable to worsening heart failure, more liberal use of digoxin in the management of heart failure may be justified. Digoxin may be adequate as monotherapy for ventricular rate control in patients with chronic AF, particularly in sedentary and elderly patients. A beta-blocker or calcium antagonist (either alone or in combination with digoxin) is indicated when digoxin is ineffective for ventricular rate control. Digoxin is ineffective in restoring sinus rhythm, preventing paroxysms or controlling rate in paroxysmal AF. The elderly are at an increased risk of digoxin toxicity. Low dosages of digoxin appear to be effective in the treatment of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and may reduce the incidence of digitalis toxicity in these patients. In elderly patients with AF and inadequate rate control who are receiving digitalis monotherapy, adding another atrioventricular nodal blocking drug may be more appropriate than increasing the digoxin dose, in order to avoid toxic digoxin levels.",E,E

After 4 weeks on placebo, pretreatment ANP, 56 +/- 7 pg/ml, was slightly but not significantly higher than that of 29 controls (41 +/- 4) and correlated with age (r = 0.44), ECG score for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (r = 0.51) and serum creatinine (r = 0.67), and negatively with creatinine clearance (r = -0.39). Atenolol reduced blood pressure (BP) by 0 +/- 6/8 +/- 2 mm Hg (ns/P < 0.01), and zofenopril by 14 +/- 4/6 +/- 2 (P < 0.01/P < 0.01), not significantly different between the two agents. Heart rate was decreased by atenolol (-16 +/- 4 bpm, P < 0.01) but not by zofenopril (+1 +/- 2 bpm, ns). Atenolol increased ANP in all patients but one (delta = +42 +/- 9 pg/ml, P < 0.01), while zofenopril did not change it significantly (-6 +/- 6 pg/ml), due to 15 patients exhibiting decreases and 10 increases in plasma ANP. The effect of atenolol on ANP positively correlated with duration of hypertension (r = 0.74), ECG score for LVH (r = 0.73) and serum creatinine (r = 0.68). Individual changes in ANP by zofenopril negatively correlated with pretreatment ANP (r = -0.69), ECG score for LVH (r = -0.44) and serum creatinine (r = -0.41). No correlations were found between BP, heart rate or their changes by treatment and the effect of either agent on plasma ANP. Multiple linear regression showed that the change in ANP was explained by the therapeutic agent used, the pretreatment plasma level of ANP, and the ECG score for LVH (F = 12.5, P < 0.001, r2 = 0.56). We conclude that the effect of antihypertensives on plasma ANP is independent of their action on BP, but dependent on an interaction between the type of drug employed and those clinical characteristics of the patient that reflect pre-existing hypertensive target organ damage.",E,E

However, beta-blockers attenuate some components of the autonomic response to hypoglycemia and could increase the risk of hypoglycemia. ACE inhibitors may increase insulin sensitivity and predispose users to hypoglycemia.; To determine whether use of cardioselective beta-blockers, nonselective beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, or other antihypertensive drugs alters the risk of developing serious hypoglycemia among older persons prescribed insulin or sulfonylureas.; Retrospective cohort study.; Tennessee Medicaid Program.; A total of 13,559 elderly (mean age, 78+/-7 years) Medicaid enrollees, who were prescribed insulin (n=5171, 38%) or sulfonylureas (n=8368, 62%) from 1985 through 1989.

The rate of serious hypoglycemia was 2.01 per 100 person-years among those who were not prescribed antihypertensives. Crude rates of serious hypoglycemia were highest among users of ACE inhibitors (2.47 per 100 person-years) and lowest among users of cardioselective beta-blockers (1.23 per 100 person-years). However, when we controlled for demographic characteristics and markers of comorbidity, there was no statistically significant increase or decrease in risk of serious hypoglycemia among users of any class of antihypertensive agents compared with nonusers of antihypertensive drugs. Using nonselective beta-blockers as the reference group, each of these agents was associated with a lower, but not statistically significant, risk of hypoglycemia.; In this population, specific antihypertensive drug therapy had little impact on the risk of hypoglycemia in older diabetic patients. Therapy should be chosen based on other considerations of safety and effectiveness.",I,E

A recent combined analysis of several studies with the alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent carvedilol demonstrated a significant survival advantage; however, the total number of events was small. Furthermore, it is unclear if previous studies with other beta-blockers are consistent with this finding.; Randomized clinical trials of beta-blockade treatment in patients with CHF from January 1975 through February 1997 were identified using a MEDLINE search and a review of reports from scientific meetings. Studies were included if mortality was reported during 3 or more months of follow-up.; We identified 35 reports, 17 of which met the inclusion criteria. These studies included 3,039 patients with follow-up ranging from 3 months to 2 years. Beta-blockade was associated with a trend toward mortality reduction in 13 studies. When all 17 reports were combined, beta-blockade significantly reduced all-cause mortality (random effect odds ratio [OR] 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54 to 0.88). A trend toward greater treatment effect was noted for nonsudden cardiac death (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.83) compared with sudden cardiac death (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.2).

Of 41,021 patients randomized to receive accelerated tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), streptokinase or a combination of both agents in the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries study, there were 5,944 patients with diabetes and 34,888 patients without diabetes.; Patients with diabetes were older and more likely to be female, to present with anterior wall infarction, to receive thrombolysis later and to have triple-vessel coronary artery disease. Mortality at 30 days was highest among diabetic patients treated with insulin (12.5%) compared with non-insulin-treated diabetic (9.7%) and nondiabetic (6.2%) patients (p < 0.001). Mortality was lowest among those with diabetes receiving accelerated t-PA, which is consistent with the results of the overall patient cohort. Although stroke occurred more frequently among diabetic (1.9%) than nondiabetic patients (1.4%, p < 0.001), there was no significant difference in the rates of intracranial hemorrhage.

In patients whose blood pressure (BP) remained uncontrolled after 8 weeks of monotherapy, atenolol 50 mg was added to the initial treatment. Patients were assessed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic BP (SDBP) at 8 weeks. Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic BP (SSBP) and responder rates (percentage of patients with SDBP < 90 mmHg or drop > or = 10 mmHg compared to baseline) at 8 weeks.; Valsartan and HCTZ were both effective at lowering diastolic and systolic blood pressure at all time points. Similar falls were seen in both groups with no significant differences between treatments. For the primary variable (decrease in SDBP) there was no significant difference between treatments.

About 40-80% of patients surviving the first bleeding suffer a recurrence within 1 year. This high recurrence rate substantially contributes to the mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis. Therefore, various treatment regimens in both primary and secondary prophylaxis were studied. Most experience in medical primary prophylaxis was collected with beta-blockers, mainly propranolol. Treating patients with oesophageal varices with propranolol significantly reduces the incidence of first variceal bleeding. However, the effect on mortality is marginal, and primary prophylaxis is generally not recommended in these patients. Several studies support the hypothesis that medical prophylaxis with beta-blockers is more effective in reducing the rate of first oesophageal bleeding in patients with a high risk of haemorrhage, such as those with very large varices with red spots. A score to assess an individual patient's risk of variceal bleeding would be helpful, but until such a score has been validated, no general rule for this treatment decision can be given. In secondary prophylaxis, both beta-blockers and endoscopic therapy (sclerotherapy or ligation of the varices) are effective in lowering the rate of rebleeding. However, the effect on mortality was not significant in most studies. Several studies comparing the efficacy of medical prophylaxis and endoscopic treatment showed advantages of the endoscopic therapy with a greater reduction in recurrent bleeding episodes. However, medical prophylaxis with beta-blockers has the important advantage of being immediately effective, whereas endoscopic procedures provide the best protection against recurrent bleeding after complete obliteration of the varices. Therefore, in the first weeks and months of endoscopic therapy, additional treatment with beta-blockers may further reduce the risk of rebleeding. Only half of all studies on this topic reported a significant advantage with this combined therapy. Therefore, it seems reasonable to restrict this approach to patients with a high risk of rebleeding, such as patients with large sclerotherapy-derived oesophageal ulcers.",I,8

It has been shown that HRV is depressed during acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and that it recovers with time. Beta-blockers reduce mortality after AMI and changes in sympathico-vagal activity have been suggested to be of importance. Under certain animal experimental conditions, metoprolol has been reported to increase vagal tone more than atenolol, which could have clinical implications. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of atenolol and metoprolol treatments on HRV during 6 weeks after AMI and to follow the post MI changes in HRV in patients on betablockers.; In an open, randomised cross-over study, 28 patients were randomised to 3+3 weeks' treatment with atenolol or metoprolol starting 2-5 days after AMI. Twenty-four hour Holter recordings were made before randomisation and after 3 and 6 weeks. HRV was analysed as HR, SDRR, SDANN, SD, rMSSD and pNN50 in the time domain and as coefficient of component variance (CCV) of HF and LF, and as LF/HF ratio in the frequency domain.; The average daily dose in our study population was 106 mg of metoprolol and 54 mg of atenolol. There were trends toward lower heart rates daytime, lower LF/HF ratio daytime and higher rMSSD on atenolol compared to metoprolol. In the total group of 28 patients we found during the first 3 weeks, a significant increase of SDNN, SDANN (p<0.0001) and LF/HF ratio daytime and CCV-HF night-time (p<0.01). All differences and trends were unchanged between 3 and 6 weeks.; There was no evidence of more increased vagal tone with metoprolol compared to atenolol as has been suggested from animal models.

We performed a MEDLARS search using the MeSH heading ""hypertension"" and the text word ""nifedipine"" to identify all articles that were published between 1966 and August 1995 in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish languages and that involved human subjects. The computerized search was supplemented by a manual search of article bibliographies. Review of 1880 citations revealed 98 randomized controlled clinical trials that met protocol criteria. Articles were extracted independently by two doctors who were blinded for author, institution, and treatment regimen, using a structured, pretested extraction form. Differences of opinion were resolved by consensus. Fourteen events occurred in 5198 exposures (0.27%) to nifedipine and 24 events in 5402 exposures (0.44%) to other active drug controls. Unadjusted odds ratios for nifedipine versus controls were 0.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-1.09) for definitive events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, revascularization procedure) and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.31-1.17) for all events (definitive plus increased angina). The odds ratio for nifedipine monotherapy (sustained- or extended-release in 91% of exposures) was nonsignificantly higher for definitive and all events (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.49-4.03 and odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.59-3.32, respectively).

Differences in odds ratio for nifedipine monotherapy and combined therapy were statistically significant (P=.02 for definitive events and P=.001 for all events).

Furthermore, treated hypertensive patients still have a higher cardiovascular complication rate, compared with matched normotensives. This is particularly evident in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a major independent risk indicator for cardiovascular disease. In addition to elevating blood pressure, angiotensin II (A-II) exerts an important influence on cardiac structure and function, stimulating cell proliferation and growth. Thus, to further reduce morbidity and mortality when treating hypertensive patients, it may be important to effectively block the effects of A-II. This can be achieved directly at the A-II receptor level by losartan, the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents. It therefore seems pertinent to investigate whether selective A-II receptor blockade with losartan not only lowers blood pressure but also reduces LVH more effectively than current therapy, and thus improves prognosis. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction (LIFE) in Hypertension study is a double-blind, prospective, parallel group study designed to compare the effects of losartan with those of the beta-blocker atenolol on the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in approximately 8,300 hypertensive patients (initial sitting diastolic blood pressure 95 to 115 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure 160 to 200 mm Hg) with electrocardiographically documented LVH. The study, which will continue for at least 4 years and until 1,040 patients experience one primary endpoint, has been designed with a statistical power that will detect a difference of at least 15% between groups in the incidence of combined cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is also the first prospective study with adequate power to link reversal of LVH to reduction in major cardiovascular events. The rationale of the study, which will involve more than 800 clinical centers in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, is discussed, and the major features of its design and general organization are described.

Newer beta-blockers such as carvedilol have not been tested in this setting.; This study investigated the effects of acute (intravenous) and long-term (6 months, oral) treatment with carvedilol versus placebo in 151 consecutive patients with AMI. Exercise ECG, ambulatory monitoring, and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed before hospital discharge and at 3 and 6 months. All patients were followed up and cardiovascular events recorded. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare time from randomization with the occurrence of a cardiovascular event, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated.

Fifty-four patients had heart failure at study entry; 34 received carvedilol. There were no adverse effects of carvedilol therapy and no excess events in this subgroup. Carvedilol produced significant reductions in heart rate (P < .0001), blood pressure (P < .005) at rest, and rate-pressure product at peak exercise (P < .003), but exercise capacity was unchanged. Left ventricular ejection fraction was not altered significantly by carvedilol, but stroke volume was higher at pre-hospital discharge examination (63 versus 53 mL; P < .01).

We also evaluated the tolerability of both drugs. Sixty patients (42 males, 18 females, mean age 52 +/- 4 years) in renal failure maintained on haemodialysis, with coronary artery disease and more than four significant episodes of transient myocardial ischemia (> or = 1 min) during 48-hour Holter monitoring, were included in the study. All cardiovascular drugs were discontinued > or = 6 days before this 48-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring, with the exception of sublingual nitrates allowed for relief of anginal attacks. Patients were then randomized to receive either bisoprolol or nifedipine for 2 weeks. After a 15-day wash-out period, they were crossed over to receive either bisoprolol or nifedipine for other 2 weeks. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Student's t test. A p value < 0.01 was considered significant. Both bisoprolol and nifedipine reduced number and duration of transient ischemic episodes as well as the total ischemic burden. Reductions were statistically significant for both antianginal drugs. Only bisoprolol was effective in silent ischemia (p < 0.001). It also reduced heart rate (p < 0.001), while nifedipine raised it (p < 0.001). Both drugs reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The circadian variations of transient ischemic episodes showed two peaks in the 24 hours. Both peaks were reduced with bisoprolol. Nifedipine brought a clear overall reduction in the number of episodes but the circadian pattern was unchanged. During the study, 10 patients taking bisoprolol and 12 patients taking nifedipine had drug adverse effects. No one of them had to be withdrawn from treatment. In conclusion, bisoprolol seems to be more useful than nifedipine because its effects, in transient ischemic episodes, are greatly superior to those of nifedipine, and because it is effective also in silent ischemia. Both drugs showed a good tolerability in these patients. Bisoprolol, reducing the two daily peaks of ischemic episodes frequency, has a protective role towards mortality due to coronary artery disease.",E,E

Overall, routine prophylactic use of class I antiarrhythmic agents in high risk patients, mostly survivors of acute myocardial infarction, is associated with increased risk of death [61 trials, 23,486 patients: odds ratio (OR) 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.27, p < 0.05]. Conversely, beta-blockers are associated with highly significant reductions in risk of death in postinfarction patients (56 trials, 53,521 patients: OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.87, p < 0.00001). Overall data from the amiodarone trials on high risk patients, including postinfarction patients, patients with congestive heart failure or survivors of cardiac arrest, suggest that this agent is effective in reducing the risk of death (14 trials, 5713 patients: OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95, p = 0.01) although further studies are needed to better define which types of patients will potentially benefit most from this agent. No benefits were seen with calcium channel blockers (26 trials, 21,644 patients: OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.13, p = NS). The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is a promising option for high risk patients, but definition of its role awaits the completion of ongoing clinical trials. Since causes of sudden death are heterogeneous, the clinician should pursue a multifactorial approach to its prevention. Primary and secondary prevention of cardiac ischaemia, through the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and maximising the use of aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering drugs, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors after acute myocardial infarction, should lead to a future decrease in the incidence of sudden cardiac death.",I,8

Echocardiograms were obtained semiannually and evaluated in a blinded fashion. Of 99 patients in the study, aged 55 +/- 13 years, with heart failure for 5.2 +/- 3.1 years, 74 were men, 69 were Caucasian, and 34 had ischemic cardiomyopathy. The final dosage of enalapril was 40 +/- 23 mg/day of isosorbide dinitrate it was 153 +/- 127 mg/day.; Initial New York Heart Association classification improved from 2.8 +/- 0.9 to 1.7 +/- 0.9 (p < 0.001) in 2.7 years of follow-up. Of the 99 patients, 72 further improved their ejection fraction. For the whole group, ejection fraction increased from 21 +/- 9% to 30 +/- 13% in 6 months (p < 0.001), with a reduction in LV end-diastolic size from 6.6 +/- 0.9 to 6.3 +/- 1.0 cm (p = 0.002), a decrease in the severity of mitral regurgitation from mild/moderate to only mild. Resting heart rate declined with no change over time in systemic systolic blood pressure. Final ejection fraction for nonischemic patients (n = 65) was 36 +/- 16% versus 23 +/- 9% for the ischemic population.; Uptitration of high-dose ACE inhibitor and nitrate therapy to higher doses is well tolerated in severe heart failure, further improves both clinical status and LV systolic function, and is more effective in nonischemic than in ischemic cardiomyopathy.",E,E

Atenolol, a cardio-selective beta-blocker, has been shown to be a safe and effective antihypertensive agent. The extended-release form of felodipine (felodipine ER), a vascular-selective dihydropyridine calcium blocker, is extensively used in Caucasians. However, its effectiveness, tolerability and adverse side-effect have not been assessed in Chinese populations.; Sitting blood pressure (BP), heart rate, body weight, adverse reaction and serum biochemistry were assessed in 70 patients with mild-moderate essential hypertension treated either with felodipine ER (37 patients), or atenolol (33 patients) for 10 weeks. Each patient was prescribed 5 mg of felodipine ER or 50 mg of atenolol once daily and this daily dosage was doubled to twice daily if necessary.; Six patients who received felodipine ER and 3 who received atenolol withdrew from the treatment because of intolerable side effects. Within ten weeks, 81.1% of the patients had responded to a total daily dosage of 5-10 mg of felodipine ER and 81.8% to a daily dose of 50-100 mg of atenolol. By the end of treatment, the mean BP in the felodipine ER group had decreased from 176/104 mmHg at baseline to 145/85 mmHg, while the BP in the atenolol group had dropped from 173/103 mmHg to 145/84 mmHg (NS between the two groups). Heart rate declined in the atenolol group but did not change in patients who received felodipine ER. Overall, patients in the felodipine ER group had a higher rate of adverse reaction (70.3% vs. 39.4%; p < 0.001), and 16.2% of the patients in the felodipine ER group experienced symptoms of hypotension.; Equivalent doses of felodipine ER and atenolol are effective first-line monotherapeutic agents for the treatment of mild-moderate essential hypertension.",1,E

It has been the performance of relatively large, carefully controlled and often mortality endpoint trials that has given us great insight into therapies that are advantageous, disadvantageous, or neutral with respect to outcomes in patients with heart failure. No longer is the care of a patient with ventricular dysfunction and heart failure solely rooted in the prescription of a diuretic and digoxin. Indeed, we have seen a rather radical evolution from this prescription practice to approaches that were thought to be contraindicated at one time, such as beta blocker and vasodilator therapy. Indeed, treatment paradigms today are shifting rapidly toward more complete attenuation of adrenergic processes known to be detrimental in this setting. It is important to review the recent clinical trials that have given us further insight into managing heart failure. Twenty trials published since 1995 have been selected because of the important insight they give us regarding the wide spectrum of therapeutic options available for individuals with heart failure.",I,8

In 12 patients with hypertension, renal-clearance studies demonstrated that bunazosin significantly increased renal blood flow from 683 +/- 82 (SD) to 829 +/- 103 ml/min (p < 0.05) and decreased renal vascular resistance from 0.18 +/- 0.02 to 0.14 +/- 0.02 mm Hg/(ml/min) (p < 0.05), but that prazosin had little effect on renal function. In a radioligand-binding assay, specific, saturable, and stereoselective [3H]bunazosin binding, with a single class of binding sites (Kd = 2.7 +/- 1.4 nM; Bmax = 44 +/- 16 fmol/mg protein; n = 11) was detected in membrane preparations of human renal medullae. The rank order of potency of antagonists that inhibited [3H]bunazosin-binding was bunazosin (Ki in nM = 49) > prazosin (57) > yohimbine (3,900) > propranolol (29,000), and that of agonists, l-norepinephrine (7,400) > l-epinephrine (19,000) > d-norepinephrine (71,000). The competition curves fit a one-site model.

There was a two-week wash-out phase between each of the four treatment phases. At the end of each treatment phase glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by inulin and para-amino-hippuric acid (PAH) clearance. Proteinuria was determined in the course of a three-day collection period at the end of each treatment phase. During this period blood pressures were measured with a continuous 24-hour blood pressure monitor.; Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was significantly reduced, compared with placebo, by all three antihypertensives (108 +/- 9 mm Hg with placebo, 98 +/- 12 mg Hg with atenolol, 101 +/- 11 mm Hg with celiprolol and 98 +/- 8 mm Hg with ramipril; P < 0.01).

However, these results were obtained in medium-term studies of < 1 year duration. We report the results obtained with long-term (3-4 years) carvedilol administration to 40 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who were initially recruited in a 4-month double-blind placebo-controlled trial. In the initial 4-month double-blind trial, 20 patients were randomized to placebo and 20 to carvedilol treatment. All patients, except one who was not on ACE-inhibitors, were on digoxin, furosemide and ACE-inhibitors. Carvedilol or placebo doses were progressively titrated, at weekly intervals, up to the maximal doses of 25 mg bid. After the initial 4-month double-blind phase, all patients were followed long term. Mean follow-up duration was 52 +/- 12 months (range 48-61). Among the 20 patients initially randomized to carvedilol administration, 4 died (3 for cardiac and 1 for extracardiac causes) and 2 underwent heart transplant. Among the 20 patients initially randomized to placebo, 5 died for cardiac causes, 3 underwent heart transplant and 4 were started on carvedilol because of progressive heart failure during the initial 4 months of the study. The remaining 8 patients, who were kept on digoxin, furosemide and ACE-inhibitors, were used as control group. Each patient underwent an assessment of clinical conditions (NYHA functional classification and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire), equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography, and maximal cardiopulmonary bicycle exercise testing. Exams were performed before treatment, after 4 and 12 months, and at the end of the follow-up period. No significant difference between the carvedilol and control group was present at baseline. Compared with baseline, patients in the control group presented a significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume after long-term follow-up (from 126 +/- 62 to 138 +/- 43 and 158 +/- 52 ml/m2 after 12 and 48 months, respectively). No significant difference, compared to baseline values, was noted. Patients on carvedilol presented a persistent improvement in left ventricular function.

During a 10 +/- 12 month follow-up, recurrence rate for paroxysmal arrhythmia was 64%, with a 50% recurrence at 4.6 months. For patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, ventricular rates were well controlled with sotalol administration (136 +/- 33 beats/min versus 88 +/- 23 beats/min; p = 0.04). No patient with chronic atrial fibrillation converted to sinus rhythm during the study. Side effects necessitated sotalol discontinuation in three patients. By multivariate analysis, younger age, higher ejection fraction, and absence of hypertension independently predicted sotalol efficacy.",E,E

After a washout period of 10 days, 27 inpatients with major depression were treated with trazodone 100 mg/day (orally). One week later (T0), fluoxetine 20 mg/day, placebo, or pindolol 7.5 mg/day was added. Plasma concentrations of mCPP and trazodone were determined at T0 and 2 and 4 weeks later. Although placebo pindolol had no significant effect on the plasma concentrations of mCPP and trazodone, there was a significant increase of the concentrations of these compounds associated with the combination of trazodone + fluoxetine. The results suggest that fluoxetine-induced increases in plasma mCPP and trazodone concentrations contribute to the clinical efficacy of the combination of fluoxetine + trazodone. It is suggested that desensitization of 5-HT2C receptor function by mCPP as well as fluoxetine may contribute to the antidepressant effects of this combination.",E,E

Restoration of the number of down-regulated beta-adrenoceptors has been suggested to be one mechanism of beta-blocker effectiveness. However, the reversal of postreceptor events, namely, an increase in inhibitory G-protein alpha-subunit concentrations, could also play a role.; Fifteen patients with heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction 24.6 +/- 1.5% [mean +/- SD], New York Heart Association functional class II or III) were treated with metoprolol (maximal dose 50 mg three times daily) for 6 months. Before and after metoprolol treatment, inotropic responses to milrinone (5 to 10 micrograms/kg body weight per min) were measured echocardiographically. For comparison, responses to milrinone were determined under control conditions and after accelerated application of 150 mg of metoprolol to inactivate beta-adrenoceptors in subjects with normal left ventricular function.; In subjects with normal left ventricular function, treatment with metoprolol did not alter the increase in fractional shortening or pressure/dimension ratio of circumferential fiber shortening after application of milrinone. In patients with heart failure, treatment with metoprolol significantly increased left ventricular ejection fraction, fractional shortening and submaximal exercise tolerance and reduced heart rate, plasma norepinephrine concentrations and functional class. After metoprolol treatment, milrinone increased fractional shortening but had no effect before beta-blocker treatment.; Milrinone increases inotropic performance independently of beta-adrenoceptors in vivo. Metoprolol treatment restores the blunted inotropic response to milrinone in patients with heart failure, indicating that postreceptor events (e.g., increase in inhibitory G-protein) are favorably influenced. This mechanism could contribute to the beneficial effects observed in the study patients and represents an important mechanism of how beta-blocker treatment influences the performance of the failing heart.",E,E

We conducted a 6-month, double-blind randomized study to compare the effects of an alpha1-adrenoreceptor blocker (bunazosin) with those of a beta1-adrenoreceptor blocker (metoprolol) on early hypertensive target organ damage at a similar level of blood pressure reduction. The study consisted of 43 patients (29 men and 14 women) of varying ages (mean age 52 +/- 9 years) with essential hypertension World Health Organization stage I-II. Both the alpha- and the beta-blocker lowered blood pressure to a similar extent measured by 24-h blood pressure monitoring. The left ventricular mass was comparably reduced in both cohorts (alpha-blocker 284 +/- 80 v 259 +/- 67 g, P < .05, beta-blocker 282 +/- 74 v 254 +/- 70 g, P < .05). Treatment with the alpha-blocker led to reduced total peripheral resistance (22.9 +/- 8.0 v 19.9 +/- 5.3 U, P < .05), whereas therapy with the beta-blocker resulted in an elevated total peripheral resistance (25.5 +/- 8.4 v 28.5 +/- 9.3 U, P < .10; P < .05 for the difference in both groups). Renal plasma flow remained constant in the alpha-blocker treated group but decreased in the beta-blocker treated group (508 +/- 141 v 477 +/- 134 mL/min/1.73 m2, P < .05). Glomerular filtration rate as measured by inulin clearance tended to increase after treatment with the alpha-blocker (112 +/- 20 v 115 +/- 18 mL/min/1.73 m2, P < .10) in accordance with a decrease of serum creatinine (1.00 +/- 0.14 v 0.93 +/- 0.12 mg/dL, P < .001).

Left ventricular hypertrophy was similarily reduced with alpha- and with beta-blockade at a comparable reduction of 24-h blood pressure. Alpha-blockers effected a more favorable renal and systemic hemodynamic profile than beta-blockers, but only long-term prospective studies will answer the question whether these hemodynamic effects result into a better cardiovascular prognosis.",E,E

Atrial fibrillation developed in 23.3% of the patients, 6.7% after metoprolol compared with 40% in the placebo group. Atrial fibrillation developed a mean of 2.9 days postoperatively. The predominant hemodynamic findings were perioperative lower oxygen consumption and postoperative lower cardiac index after metoprolol. Patients developing atrial fibrillation had much higher oxygen consumption and postoperative cardiac index than other patients.; Perioperative oral beta-blockade can reduce the frequency of atrial fibrillation without serious side effects.

Beta-blockers have often been viewed as contraindicated in this group because of their potential adverse short-term effects on cardiac function.; One hundred thirty-one patients with severe congestive heart failure were enrolled into a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the vasodilating beta-blocker carvedilol. All patients had symptomatic, advanced heart failure while on standard triple therapy, as evidenced by a mean ejection fraction of 0.22, marked reduction in distance traveled in a 6-minute corridor walk test, and severe impairment in quality of life measured by the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire. After a 2-week, open-label test of 6.25 mg twice daily carvedilol, 105 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either carvedilol (up to 25 mg twice daily, n = 70) or matching placebo (n = 35) for 6 months while background therapy with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor remained constant. Ten patients (8%) did not complete the open-label period because of adverse events and 11.4% in both the carvedilol and placebo groups dropped out in the double-blind phase. The study was terminated early by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board and follow-up evaluation was therefore aborted before the projected number of patients and follow-up time was achieved. Quality of life, which was the primary endpoint, improved similarly in the carvedilol and placebo groups, whereas the global assessment by the physicians and the patient exhibited a better response to carvedilol (P < .05). Hospitalization and mortality rate were too low to evaluate a difference, and exercise time and New York Heart Association classification did not change significantly in response to the drug. Left ventricular ejection fraction rose significantly (+0.09) in the carvedilol group compared with the placebo group (+0.02, P = .004).; The beta-blocker carvedilol can be safely employed in patients with severe heart failure. Improved left ventricular function with a trend for some improvement in symptoms combined with the experience with the drug in the larger population of less severe patients in this multicenter trial suggests that carvedilol may have a favorable long-term effect in heart failure of diverse severity.",I,I

Increased insulin/glucose ratios (IGR) suggestive of insulin resistance were found in half of our patients. Hyperinsulinemic and normoinsulinemic obese patients with hypertension had comparable fasting glucose and DHEA-S concentrations and comparable blood pressure (BP) levels. Thus no relations were found between fasting insulin and DHEA-S levels. Fasting hyperinsulinemia was found in only half of the obese subjects with hypertension, suggesting that not all obese patients with hypertension are at the same high cardiovascular risk. Short-term treatment with captopril, prazosin, verapamil, atenolol, or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) reduced BP; greater BP reduction was observed with drugs with vasodilatory effects. Captopril, prazosin, and verapamil reduced fasting insulin levels, whereas atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide did not. The former drugs reduced fasting insulin levels that were either within normal limits or in the hyperinsulinemic range. None of the drug treatments produced significant increases in serum DHEA-S concentrations, although some of them considerably reduced fasting insulin levels. No relations between insulin and DHEA-S levels were observed either at baseline or at the end of the antihypertensive treatment. The BP reduction resulting from the peripheral vasodilation may explain the insulin-reducing action of captopril, verapamil, and prazosin. These results further emphasize the large heterogeneity present in the pathophysiologic mechanisms operating in obesity and hypertension.",E,E

Heart rate change over time had the highest predictive value for survival (P<.01).

LVFS change over time was also significantly correlated with further survival (P<.02 by Cox analysis).

Patients who demonstrated improvement of LVFS over time (82% and 51% of patients in the bisoprolol and the placebo groups, respectively; P<.02) were at lower risk, but the hazard did not further decrease with a further increase of fractional shortening, and there was no significant difference between study treatment groups. Finally, it could be demonstrated that each of the three factors (heart rate change over time, LVFS change over time, and bisoprolol treatment) made a specific contribution to mortality rate.; Preservation of left ventricular function appears to play a key role in the bisoprolol-induced beneficial effects on prognosis in heart failure. Short-term beta-blocker-induced cardiac effects could provide a means to identify those patients who will experience improved survival over the long term.",E,E

At baseline, participants answered questionnaires and underwent a detailed examination that included carotid ultrasound, pulmonary function tests, ECG, and echocardiography. Subjects with a pacemaker or AF at baseline (n=357) were excluded. New cases of AF were identified from three sources: (1) annual self-reports, (2) annual ECGs, and (3) hospital discharge diagnoses. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to assess baseline risk factors as predictors of incident AF. Among 4844 participants, 304 developed a first episode of AF during an average follow-up of 3.28 years, for an incidence of 19.2 per 1000 person-years. The onset was strongly associated with age, male sex, and the presence of clinical cardiovascular disease. For men 65 to 74 and 75 to 84 years old, the incidences were 17.6 and 42.7, respectively, and for women, 10.1 and 21.6 events per 1000 person-years. In stepwise models, the use of diuretics, a history of valvular heart disease, coronary disease, advancing age, higher levels of systolic blood pressure, height, glucose, and left atrial size were all associated with an increased risk of AF. The use of beta-blockers and high levels of alcohol use, cholesterol, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second were associated with a reduced risk of AF.; The incidence of AF in older adults may be higher than estimated by previous population studies. Left atrial size appears to be an important risk factor, and the control of blood pressure and glucose may be important in preventing the development of AF.",E,E

Since then, many studies have been performed in patients with heart failure of various aetiologies and the beneficial effects of long term beta-blockade have been confirmed. About 3000 patients have been included in randomised studies in which beta-blockade, given for more than 2 months, mostly elicited significant improvements in functional class, exercise capacity, cardiac function, quality of life and/or morbidity. When started at a very low dose (one-tenth to one-twentieth of the doses generally used in angina or hypertension), the treatment is well tolerated in most patients. In these studies, various types of beta-blockers were used, including beta1-selective blockers and nonselective blockers with additional properties (vasodilator and antioxidative) such as metoprolol, bisoprolol, bucindolol and carvedilol. Several large studies have also reported benefits on mortality and morbidity. In the Metoprolol in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (MDC) trial, metoprolol treatment in patients with IDC resulted in a 34% reduction of the primary combined endpoint, total number of deaths and need for cardiac transplantation. In the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS), in patients with idiopathic as well as ischaemic cardiomyopathy, there was a nonsignificant 20% reduction in mortality. In the US carvedilol studies (n = 1094), also in patients with ischaemic and idiopathic cardiomyopathy, carvedilol reduced mortality by 65%, which was highly significant. A nonsignificant reduction in mortality was observed in the Australia-New Zealand (ANZ) Heart Failure Study with carvedilol. In all these studies there was a reduction in hospitalisations, with all drugs being generally well tolerated. It can thus be concluded that the beneficial effects of beta-blockers on cardiac function and morbidity have been documented in a large number of studies in selected groups of patients. The treatment has been accepted in some countries by the regulatory authorities. Larger, placebo-controlled studies are needed to convincingly demonstrate a reduction in total mortality as observed in the pooling of the 4 US carvedilol studies. Such studies are in progress for various beta-blockers, which may lead to acceptance of their routine clinical use in patients with congestive heart failure.",I,8

Nineteen patients underwent 71 ECT treatments (34 placebo, 37 esmolol), recording 746 h of Holter data. The esmolol group had significantly reduced heart rate and mean arterial pressure immediately after ECT. There was no difference in the incidence of ECG defined ischemia post-ECT between groups, with 7 of 19 (36.8%) patients in the esmolol group showing ST-segment depression compared with 5 of 19 (26.3%) in the placebo group. There was no difference between groups in arrhythmia detection. This experiment demonstrates that (a) ECT is associated with a significant incidence of ST-segment depression, (b) esmolol blunts the sympathetic discharge during ECT, and (c) esmolol does not reduce the incidence of post-ECT ischemia or arrhythmia.",E,E

Combination therapy with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent might be considered in cases with insufficient efficacy of V alone. Therefore, an interaction trial was performed to evaluate the effects of co-administration of V on the pharmacokinetics of atenolol (A), and vice versa, and to monitor the pharmacodynamic response of plasma angiotensin II (ANG II) concentrations and plasma renin activity (PRA), as well as of heart rate and blood pressure, under resting and exercise conditions.; Twelve healthy, normotensive, male volunteers aged 23-46 years were treated with single doses of either 160 mg V or 100 mg A alone, or with both drugs in combination (V + A) according to a three-period crossover design. Plasma concentrations of V and A were determined using HPLC with fluorimetric and UV detection, respectively, and concentration-time profiles were established over 24 h. Plasma ANG II concentrations and PRA were monitored using specific radioimmunoassays. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured at rest and during exercise on a cycle ergometer at a workload of 2.5 W/kg-1.; For V, mean AUC and Cmax were slightly higher when A was co-administered, the ratios of log transformed values being 1.13 and 1.22 for AUC(0-inf) and Cmax, respectively. For A, mean AUC and Cmax were slightly lower when the drug was given in combination with V. The ratios of log-transformed values in this case were 0.90 and 0.92, respectively. The sharp increase in plasma ANG II concentrations and PRA, induced by administration of V, was significantly attenuated when the drug was combined with A. In the first 12 h after drug intake, heart rate and systolic blood pressure at rest were significantly decreased when V and A were co-administered compared with treatment with V alone. V given alone did not influence heart rate or systolic blood pressure during exercise, whereas A alone and V + A led to a significant reduction in those variables. Adverse experiences reported after A and V + A could be explained by the high degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade resulting from the administration of A.; Co-administration of single doses of V and A does not modify the pharmacokinetics of the two drugs to a clinically relevant degree. With respect to pharmacodynamics, a single dose of A attenuates the increase in plasma ANG II and PRA in response to a single dose of V, and V has no effect on the hemodynamic response to exercise. The combined treatment with single doses of 160 mg V and 100 mg A has some additive effects on resting blood pressure in healthy, normotensive subjects.",E,E

Patients with established coronary heart disease, or other major atherosclerotic disease, were deemed to be the top priority for prevention. A European survey (EUROASPIRE) was therefore conducted under the auspices of the ESC to describe current clinical practice in relation to secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.; The aims of EUROASPIRE were (i) to determine whether the major risk factors for coronary heart disease are recorded in patients medical records; (ii) to measure the modifiable risk factors and describe their current management following hospitalization, and (ii) to determine whether first degree blood relatives have been screened.; The survey was conducted in selected geographical areas and hospitals in nine European countries. Consecutive patients (< or = 70 years) were identified retrospectively with the following diagnoses: coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, acute myocardial infarction and acute myocardial ischaemia without infarction. Data collection was based on a retrospective review of hospital medical records and a prospective interview and examination of the patients.; 4863 medical records were reviewed of whom 25% were women, and 3569 patients were interviewed (adjusted response rate 85%) with an average age of 61 years. Nineteen percent of patients smoked cigarettes, 25% were overweight (BMI > or = 30 kg.m-2), 53% had raised blood pressure (systolic BP > or = 140 and/or diastolic BP > or = 90 mmHg), 44% had raised total plasma cholesterol (total cholesterol > or = 5.5 mmol.l-1) and 18% were diabetic. Reported medication at interview was: antiplatelet drugs 81%, beta-blockers, 54% (58% in post-infarction patients). ACE inhibitors 30% (38% in post infarction patients) and lipid lowering drugs 32%. Of the patients receiving blood pressure lowering drugs (not always prescribed for the treatment of hypertension) 50% had a systolic BP > 140 mmHg and 21% > 160 mmHg, and of those receiving lipid lowering drugs, 49% had plasma total cholesterol > 5.5 mmol.l-1 and 13% > 6.5 mmol.l-1. Thirty-seven percent of patients had a family history of premature coronary heart disease in a first-degree blood relative, but only 21% of patients reported being advised to have their relatives screened for coronary risk factors.; This European survey has demonstrated a high prevalence of modifiable risk factors in coronary heart disease patients. There is considerable potential for cardiologists and physicians to further reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality and improve patients chances of survival.",E,E

Cumulative rates of rebleeding were 23% in the TIPS group and 57% in the ES group (P = 0.0001). Hepatic encephalopathy was observed in 29% of the patients in the TIPS group and in 13% of those in the ES group (P = 0.041). Cumulative rates of survival were 69% in the TIPS group and 67% in the ES group (P = 0.62). Mortality rates in both groups were positively correlated with a higher Child's classification.; Although TIPS significantly reduced the rate of rebleeding, survival rates were not improved. Because TIPS is associated with an increased risk of encephalopathy and high rates of shunt dysfunction, which requires reintervention, the procedure cannot be recommended for elective treatment after the first variceal bleeding episode, but it is an effective therapy in patients in whom endoscopic sclerotherapy fails to control bleeding.",E,E

The combined use of endosonography, allowing the objective measurement of variceal radius, and endoscopic measurement of transmural variceal pressure may enable assessment of this important parameter. The aim of this study was to assess the effects on variceal hemodynamics of drugs acting through different mechanisms: decreasing portocollateral blood flow (propranolol) or resistance (isosorbide-5-mononitrate [ISMN]).; Repeated measurements of variceal radius, volume (by endosonography), and transmural pressure (using endoscopic gauge) were performed in 27 cirrhotic patients at baseline and 40 minutes after double-blind administration of placebo (n = 9), propranolol (n = 9), or ISMN (n = 9).; Placebo had no effect. Propranolol significantly reduced variceal volume (-32% +/- 26%; P = 0.01), radius (-12% +/- 9%; P < 0.005), and pressure (-26% +/- 10%; P < 0.0001). The resulting decrease in wall tension (-34% +/- 13%; P < 0.0005) exceeded that in transmural pressure (P < 0.01). ISMN reduced transmural variceal pressure (-26% +/- 21%; P < 0.005), but not radius (-3% +/-14%; NS) and volume (-9% +/- 31%; NS).; The combination of endosonography and endoscopic measurement of transmural variceal pressure allows quantitative estimation of variceal wall tension. Propranolol and ISMN reduce similarly transmural variceal pressure. Propranolol, but not ISMN, reduces variceal volume and radius. Therefore, despite similar decreases in variceal wall tension, propranolol may offer a greater therapeutic effect than ISMN in portal hypertension.",E,E

Our study included 416 women (57%) and 316 men (43%; mean age 62 +/- 12 years [range 16 to 93]). Patients were divided into 3 age groups: (1) group I (n = 179): < 55 years (mean 47 +/- 6), (2) group II (n = 447): 55 to 74 years (mean 64 +/- 5), and (3) group III (n = 106): > or = 75 years (mean 80 +/- 4). DSE was more likely to have negative results in women than in men (prevalence of positivity = 20% vs 31%, p = 0.001), but DSE had a similar safety profile in both genders. Women required lower doses of dobutamine and atropine to reach an end point. There was a similar incidence of test positivity in older and younger patients (23% in group I, 24% in group II, and 30% in group III, p = NS). DSE was generally a safe test in patients > or = 75 years, but there was a different safety profile in the elderly group compared with younger patients--specifically, more frequent asymptomatic hypotension (7% in group I, 13% in group II, and 25% in group III, p = 0.0002) and ventricular arrhythmias (26% in group I, 30% in group II, and 41% in group III, p = 0.04), but less frequent chest pain (32% in group I, 23% in group II, and 17% in group III, p = 0.009). Multivariate analysis suggested that the baseline usage of beta blockers was also a major determinant of the safety and ischemia profile during DSE. In conclusion, there were significant gender- and/or age-specific differences in the safety and test result profile of DSE. These differences should be considered when performing or interpreting DSE, particularly in women and in patients aged > or = 75 years.",E,E

Theoretically, when coadministered with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker the tedisamil combination could induce dangerous bradycardia and QT interval prolongation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of tedisamil and atenolol alone and in combination, on heart rate and QT interval duration at rest and during exercise tests.; The effects of tedisamil (100 mg twice daily) and atenolol (50 mg twice daily) on heart rate and QT interval duration were analysed in a three-period crossover study in healthy male volunteers.; This study showed that tedisamil exerted a significant (P<0.05) bradycardic action at rest (-10 beats min(-1); 95% CI: -6 to -15 beats min(-1)) similar to atenolol (-14 beats min(-1); -11 to -17) and drug combination (-9 beats min(-1); -6 to -12). During exercise, at the highest comparable workload, heart rate did not decrease significantly with tedisamil but decreased significantly with atenolol (-42 beats min(-1); -37 to -47) and combination (-47 beats min(-1); -41 to 52). Atenolol did not modify QT interval duration. Tedisamil alone and in combination with atenolol increased QT interval duration by 12% (95% CI: 7 to 17%) and 12% (8 to 16) respectively at RR=1000 ms, but not at RR<700 ms (combination).

Patients were randomized to receive either sevoflurane (S) (n = 106) or isoflurane (I) (n = 108) in conjunction with sodium thiopental, vecuronium, fentanyl, and 50%-70% N2O. Intraoperative hemodynamics were maintained within 20% of awake baseline with standard drugs. A Holter monitor was applied 3-24 h before surgery and maintained until 48 h after surgery. Electrocardiograms and blood samples for analysis of the MB isoenzyme fraction of creatine phosphokinase were obtained preoperatively and daily for 48 h postoperatively. Anesthetic exposure (1.79 +/- 0.15 [mean +/- SE] minimum alveolar concentration-hour) and duration of surgery (219 +/- 13 min) did not differ between groups. The incidence of ischemia in the pre-, intra- and postoperative periods, adverse cardiac outcomes (18% occurrence), intraoperative hemodynamic variations (+/-20% change from ward baseline), and administration of adjunct cardiovascular medications were similar between groups. In cardiac patients having noncardiac surgery, sevoflurane was comparable to isoflurane with respect to the incidence of intra- and postoperative myocardial ischemia and in the frequency of adverse cardiac outcomes.; Surgical patients with heart disease are at risk of heart complications, some of which could be induced by an anesthetic.

Tamsulosin is highly selective for prostatic receptors with minimal affinity for vascular receptors. Therefore, it should have little effect on blood pressure and should not potentiate other agents' antihypertensive activity. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate how coadministration of tamsulosin would affect the pharmacodynamic profiles of nifedipine, enalapril, and atenolol. Each study enrolled 12 hypertensive men aged 45 years or older whose blood pressure was being controlled with maintenance doses of nifedipine (study 1), enalapril (study 2), or atenolol (study 3). All 36 subjects were treated with placebo for 5 days and then randomly assigned to either placebo (control group) or tamsulosin therapy (0.4 mg/d for 7 days followed by 0.8 mg/d for 7 days) in addition to continuing their maintenance antihypertensive therapy. Blood pressure and pulse rate were monitored over a 24-hour period on study days 4, 11, and 19. Coadministration of tamsulosin in these small studies had no clinically significant effects on the pharmacodynamic action of nifedipine, enalapril, or atenolol; it produced no clinically significant differences in pulse rate and blood pressure, did not alter electrocardiographic or Holter monitoring results, and did not cause increased side effects. Coadministration of tamsulosin with the three antihypertensive agents studied had a favorable safety profile. Our results in these small studies indicate that the dose of nifedipine, enalapril, or atenolol did not require adjustment in patients given tamsulosin, which may give tamsulosin an advantage over other alpha-blocking agents used to treat patients with BPH. Now that tamsulosin has been approved in the United States, further clinical use may confirm these findings.",I,E

The behaviour of the Na+ total efflux (Na+ TE), of the Na+/K+ pump, of the Na+K+ cotransport (Na+/K+ CT), of the Na+/Li+ counter transport (Na+/Li+ Cnt), of the Na+ passive permeability (Na+ PP), of the intracellular Na+ (I Na+) and of the plasmatic noradrenaline (NE) was evaluated basally, at the third minute during cold pressor test (CPT) and 20 minutes after the end of the test. The test, which the same method, was repeated after a 30 day treatment with propranolol at the dose of 240 mg/day in three daily administrations. The beta-blockade caused, besides the reduction of both the systolic and diastolic pressure values, a significant increase in the Na+/K+ CT (from 248 +/- 41 to 314 +/- 71 mmol/l/cells/h, p < 0.001) and a decrease in the Na+ PP (from 0.039 +/- 0.004 to 0.023 +/- 0.007 hr-1, p < 0.00001), probably directed towards the reduction of the accumulation of intracellular Na+, that could compete, among the other mechanisms, with the anti-hypertensive action of the beta-blockers. The CPT caused, before the beta-blockade, a significant depression of the Na+/K+ pump (from 2057 +/- 149 to 1610 +/- 101 mmol/l/cells/h, p < 0.00001) and of the Na+ TE (from 2640 +/- 397 to 2032 +/- 179 mmol/l/cells/h, p < 0.00001) inversely correlated to the levels of NE (r = -0.60, p < 0.003), with a consequent increase in I Na+ (from 6.2 +/- 0.6 to 7.5 +/- 1.5 mmol/l/cells, p < 0.001), showing how the adrenergic activation in hypertensive subjects is able to interfere with the systems of transmembrane transport with an inhibitory attitude, that is expressed by an increase in the levels of I Na+. The beta-blockade was able to outweigh the depression of the Na+/K+ pump (from 1843 +/- 584 to 1728 +/- 640 mmol/l/cells/h, p: ns) and the reduction of the Na+ TE, preventing the accumulation of I Na+ (from 6.3 +/- 1.6 to 6.6 +/- 1.3 mmol/l/cells, p: ns). Such data show an increased susceptibility of the Na+ transport systems to the adrenergic stimuli in hypertensive subjects with a tendency to favor the accumulation of I Na+ and that the beta-blockade is able to antagonize the effects, with a maintenance of the intracellular levels of Na+.",1,E

The forearm noradrenaline spillover was reduced after 16 months on prazosin, but remained unchanged during metoprolol treatment. Pressor responses to intravenous noradrenaline were affected little by either treatment, whereas reflexogenic bradycardia was attenuated by prazosin treatment.; The findings suggest that metoprolol and prazosin treatments reduce the minimal vascular resistance similarly, despite different reductions in blood pressure. Prazosin treatment might also reduce the forearm sympathetic nerve activity. Reductions in minimal forearm vascular resistance during antihypertensive therapy need not be related only to the lowering of the blood pressure per se.",E,E

When simultaneously considering age, sex, history of cardiovascular disease, various complications in hospital and medication at discharge, the development of congestive heart failure was found to be an independent predictor of death. The mode and place of death after initial discharge from hospital was similar in patients with and in those without congestive heart failure. Among patients with congestive heart failure who were discharged from hospital, the following factors were associated with an increased risk of death: older age (P < 0.001), no prescription of beta-blockers at discharge (P < 0.01) and a previous history of infarction (P < 0.05).; The prognosis during 5 years of follow-up after AMI was directly related to the severity of congestive heart failure based on a clinical assessment.

9391772,NSAIDs and increased blood pressure. What is the clinical significance?,"Adult; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Blood Pressure; Humans; Hypertension; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Johnson, A G","Several randomised studies have demonstrated that various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) elevate blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive individuals; however, these data have been contradicted by numerous negative studies. Two meta-analyses have demonstrated that, after pooling data drawn from published reports of randomised trials of younger adults, NSAID use produces a clinically significant increment in mean blood pressure of 5 mm Hg, most marked in patients with controlled hypertension. Stratification by NSAID type revealed that piroxicam, naproxen and indomethacin had the greatest, and sulindac the smallest, pressor effect. These data were supported by 2 large community studies involving elderly patients. Recent NSAID users had a 1.7-fold higher risk of requiring the initiation of antihypertensive therapy compared with nonusers; NSAID users also had a 40% increased risk of receiving a diagnosis of hypertension compared with nonusers. It is vital to determine the nature of the association in the elderly, 12 to 15% of whom are concurrently receiving an NSAID and an antihypertensive agent. Importantly, a 5 to 6 mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure maintained over a few years may be associated with a 67% increase in total stroke risk and a 15% increase in coronary heart disease events. While the mechanism(s) remain speculative, salt and water retention through several factors operating in parallel, coupled with increased total peripheral vascular resistance, via increased renal endothelin-1 synthesis, are potentially important. Clinicians should strive to avoid excessive use of NSAID treatment and consider well-tolerated therapeutic alternatives, including simple analgesics and physical therapy. For patients who require concomitant NSAID and antihypertensive treatment, physicians should be aware that indomethacin, naproxen and piroxicam may be associated with a greater pressor effect than many other NSAIDs, and that antagonism of beta-blockers may be greater than that of vasodilators (including ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists) and diuretics. Finally, the progress of each patient should be monitored by careful blood pressure measurement, particularly during the period of initiation of NSAID therapy.",E,E

Out of 809 patients with stable angina pectoris, lipid variables were obtained in 786 patients at baseline, and after one month's double-blind treatment with metoprolol or verapamil, to evaluate treatment effects on these lipid variables. During a median follow-up time of 3.3 years (2663 patient years), 37 patients suffered a CV death, 30 suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and 100 underwent a revascularization. Apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were predictors of CV death or non-fatal MI in univariate analyses, but only apo A-I remained as an independent predictor in multivariate analyses. All lipid variables except low density lipoprotein cholesterol were related to the risk of revascularization in univariate analyses, but only apo A-I and apo B were independent predictors of such events. Triglycerides were weakly, but not independently, associated with prognosis. Verapamil and metoprolol had differential short-term effects on lipids, with a shift towards a more atherogenic profile in metoprolol treated patients. However, there was no significant impact of the treatment given, or of these treatment effects on the risk of CV events. Results of the present study suggest that apolipoprotein levels were better predictors of CV events than other lipid parameters in patients with stable angina pectoris.",I,E

Resistance-size small arteries (standardized lumen diameter of 247 +/- 8 microns) were studied after dissection from a gluteal subcutaneous biopsy. Small arteries were investigated on a wire myograph and as pressurized vessels. On the myograph, the media width-to-lumen diameter ratio of arteries was 5.37 +/- 0.09% in normotensive subjects, 5.38 +/- 0.18% in patients treated with nifedipine GITS, 6.81 +/- 0.18% in patients treated with atenolol and 7.08 +/- 0.12% in untreated hypertensives (p < 0.001, untreated or atenolol-treated patients vs. normotensives or nifedipine-GITS-treated hypertensives), and similar results were found in pressurized arteries. Contractility and endothelium-dependent relaxation were impaired in small arteries from untreated or atenolol-treated patients in comparison to those from normotensive subjects or nifedipine-GITS-treated patients. In conclusion, hypertensive patients with well-controlled blood pressure under treatment for more than 1 year with nifedipine GITS exhibit normal structure and function of small arteries, whereas similar patients whose blood pressure is as well controlled by the beta-blocker atenolol present abnormally thick small arteries with impaired contractility and endothelium-dependent relaxation. It will be important to determine whether small arteries of other vascular beds are also improved by nifedipine GITS treatment of elevated blood pressure and whether this results in reduced morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients.",E,E

Twenty milligrams of slow-release nifedipine twice daily (n = 14) produced a consistent reduction in the BP over the entire 24-h period and effectively blunted the rise in BP in the morning. Captopril (12.5 mg) twice daily (n = 15) produced a mild reduction in BP with little change in the circadian pattern. The slow-release nifedipine group had the greatest decrease in mean systolic and diastolic BP.

The patients had angina and positive bicycle exercise tests despite optimal beta-blockade (resting heart rate < 65 beats.min-1). Randomization was to three treatment groups: continuation of metoprolol (control), addition of felodipine to metoprolol, and replacement of metoprolol by felodipine. Exercise tests were repeated after 2 and 5 weeks. The main outcome measure was: exercise result after 5 weeks, compared with baseline, between-group comparison of changes vs control. There were no significant differences in exercise duration and onset of chest pain vs control. The addition of felodipine increased time until 1 mm ST depression (43 s, 95% confidence interval 20-65 s), and decreased both ST depression at highest comparable work load (0.46 mm, 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.72), and maximal ST depression (0.49 mm, 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.74).

Chronic treatments of methysergide and propranolol, drugs exerting antagonist action at 5-HT receptors, induced a significant amelioration in 256M sufferers. On the contrary, chronic treatments of ergotamine and sumatriptan, both provided with a 5-HT1 agonist activity, induced a worsening of M in 134 M sufferers. The M worsening was paralleled by an increase in consumption of analgesic drugs.

After 1 week of a placebo run-in period, 63 untreated major depressive inpatients were randomly assigned to three different groups. Group 1 received paroxetine (20 mg/day) plus placebo (4 weeks). Group 2 received paroxetine (20 mg/day) plus pindolol (7.5 mg/day) for 1 week and placebo for 3 weeks. Group 3 received both active treatments for the entire duration of the study (4 weeks). Clinical response was defined as a reduction of the score in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) to 8 or below. Also, to preliminarily examine whether beta-adrenoreceptor blockade was involved in the action of pindolol, another group of 10 inpatients was treated in an open-label manner with paroxetine (20 mg/day) plus 50 mg/day of the beta-adrenergic antagonist metoprolol, devoid of significant affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. At endpoint, the incidence of treatment-emergent side effects did not significantly differ among the three groups. After 1 and 2 weeks of treatment, the two groups treated with paroxetine plus pindolol displayed a significantly greater response rate than the group treated with paroxetine plus placebo. At study completion, only the patients treated with pindolol for the entire period showed a significantly greater response rate (p = 0.05).

Patients with persistent pain on admission tended to have higher relative CK-MBm values (peak CK-MBm/CK: 6.8, range 0.5-17.3, versus 5.3, range 1.4-7.9, p = 0.08; AUC CK-MBm/CK: 0.05, range 0.01-0.10, versus 0.03, range 0.01-0.06, p < 0.05). Three vessel disease on coronary angiography was associated with higher peak CK-MBm/CK values during the acute phase of myocardial infarction than those with 1-2 vessel disease (Peak CK-MBm/CK: 7.9, range 5.5-17.3, versus 6.4, range 3.1-10.2, p < 0.05; AUC CK-MBm/CK: 0.06, range 0.02-0.11, versus 0.04, range 0.02-0.07, p < 0.05). We conclude that relative CK-MBm/CK levels reflect to a certain degree the extent of the coronary disease and that preinfarctional beta-blockade may result in lower CK-MBm levels.",E,E

Despite the use of prophylactic medication, such as propranolol, breakthrough attacks often occur in patients. Consequently we investigated the effects of propranolol on the pharmacokinetics of, and cardiovascular responses to, zolmitriptan.; A double-blind, randomized, crossover study of the effects of pre-treatment with propranolol 160 mg daily for 7 days or placebo on the pharmacokinetics and effects on blood pressure of a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan in 12 healthy volunteers.; Propranolol increased mean zolmitriptan Cmax and AUC by 56% and 37% respectively; mean t1/2 was prolonged from 3.1 to 4.0 h. Mean Cmax and AUC of the pharmacologically active N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 24% and 11% respectively and the metabolite:parent AUC ratio (AUCm/AUCp) fell from 0.46 to 0.26. Mean Cmax and AUC for the inactive indole acetic acid metabolite were both reduced by 13% and AUCm/AUCp from 1.04 to 0.59. A small pressor effect of short duration was observed following zolmitriptan with mean peak rises of 13 and 11 mmHg in systolic and diastolic pressures respectively; propranolol had no effect on the pressor response.; The results suggest that propranolol inhibits biotransformation of zolmitriptan but with no change in the small pressor response to zolmitriptan. It is therefore unlikely that the pharmacokinetic changes will lead to clinically important changes in pharmacological effects and dosage adjustment of zolmitriptan is not required in patients taking propranolol for migraine prophylaxis.",E,E

We analyzed illustrative examples of reports of clinical trials in which run-in periods were used to exclude noncompliant subjects, placebo responders, or subjects who could not tolerate or did not respond to active drug. The Physicians' Health Study exemplifies the use of a prerandomization run-in period to exclude subjects who are nonadherent, while recent trials of tacrine for Alzheimer disease and carvedilol for congestive heart failure typify the use of run-in periods to exclude patients who do not tolerate or do not respond to the study drug. The reported results of these studies are valid. However, because the reported results apply to subgroups of patients who cannot be defined readily based on demographic or clinical characteristics, the applicability of the results in clinical practice is diluted. Compared with results that would have been observed without the run-in period, the reported results overestimate the benefits and underestimate the risks of treatment, underestimate the number needed to treat, and yield a smaller P value. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial exemplifies the use of an active-drug run-in period that enhances clinical applicability by selecting a group of study subjects who closely resembled patients undergoing active clinical management for this problem. Run-in periods can dilute or enhance the clinical applicability of the results of a clinical trial, depending on the patient group to whom the results will be applied. Reports of clinical trials using run-in periods should indicate how this aspect of their design affects the application of the results to clinical practice.",E,E

These patients had abdominal aortic aneurysms that were considered to be too small to warrant surgical repair at the time of presentation. Sequential ultrasound examinations were used to measure maximal anteroposterior aneurysm diameter. From these data, annual growth rates were calculated. Growth rate per annum was then compared with gender, age, initial aortic aneurysm diameter, presence of hypertensive disease, cardiac disease, family history of aneurysmal disease, diabetes mellitus, smoking, beta-adrenergic blockade and lipid lowering drugs.; Univariate analysis showed that three factors were significantly related to growth rate: the initial size of the aortic aneurysm, the presence of cardiac disease and the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade.; The presence of beta-adrenergic blockade appeared to have an independent effect on aneurysm growth rate, and suggests a possible role for beta-adrenergic blockade as a therapeutic strategy in controlling expansion rates of small abdominal aortic aneurysms. A controlled double-blind clinical trial is required to demonstrate this conclusively.",E,E
9441156,[Dynamic cardiomyoplasty].,Cardiomyoplasty; Equipment Design; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Failure; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Postoperative Complications; Quality of Life; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome,"Lange, R; Thielmann, M; Hagl, S","Between 1965 and 1995 the incidence of heart failure has been constantly rising and the mortality from this disease has increased fivefold. The introduction of ACE-inhibitors and of adrenergic beta-blockers have resulted in major symptomatic improvements in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. For end-stage disease, heart transplantation offers by now the only therapeutic option and yields excellent results. The permanent implantation of left heart assist-devices is just gaining increasing importance. Yet, both methods also have inherent drawbacks and may not be available to all patients, so that new methods are constantly evaluated. Cardiomyoplasty was introduced into clinical practice in 1985 by Alain Carpentier and since then more than 700 patients have been operated worldwide. After dissection of the latissimus dorsi muscle it is wrapped around the heart in a clockwise fashion (Figure 1). Two sensing electrodes are placed on the anterior aspect of the right ventricle and two stimulation electrodes between the proximal branches of the thoracodorsal nerve (Medtronic SP 5548). The electrodes are then connected with a burststimulator (Cardiomyostimulator, Medtronic 4710) (Figure 2). During the first 2 weeks following the operation the muscle is not stimulated in order to allow for the healing process. Thereafter, a stimulation protocol with a programmed, staged increase of the stimulation frequency is started, to induce transformation of the skeletal muscle into a ""fatigue resistant"" tissue. After 3 months the muscle is stimulated with every second heart beat (2:1 mode) with full burstimpulses containing 6 single impulses per burst for a duration of 185 ms (Figure 3). Cardiomyoplasty was conceived for patients in NYHA III and severely impaired myocardial function, in whom drug treatment does not produce the expected benefits. The criteria for patient selection are strictly followed, since it has been shown in the past, that the preoperative condition of the patient is of specific importance for the postoperative outcome. Contraindications are NYHA IV, advanced right ventricular dysfunction, secondary pulmonary hypertension (> 600 dyn x s x cm-5), LV end-diastolic diameter > 70 mm und AV-valve incompetence > Grad II. Between July 1985 und October 1996 647 patients received a cardiomyoplasty with the Medtronic Cardiomyoplasty System and the results from 438 patients were analyzed from the ""Worldwide Cardiomyoplasty Study Group"". One and 2 years following the operation NYHA-class had improved by one class in 41.9% and 53.3%, respectively, and by 2 classes in 38.1% and 30.5%, respectively. In 16% and 15% no improvement was found (Figure 4). Prospective investigation of the quality of life by a score revealed a considerable improvement in the level of daily activities and social interaction. In contrast, two years after the operation, only a small, but significant increase in LV-EF from 22.9 +/- 8.1% to 25.8 +/- 9.7% (p < 0.05) was shown. Heart rate, maximal O2-consumption, total exercise time, cardiac index, stroke volume and stroke work index did not change. According to the results of a recent FDA-study, in-hospital mortality was 12% between 1991 and 1993, and was reduced during a second phase starting 1994 to < 3%. One, 2 and 3-year survival of 349 patients who were in NYHA-III prior to the operation was 69%, 56% und 47%, respectively. 43 patients who were operated in NYHA IV exhibited considerably worse survival with only 48% after 1 year and 30% after 2 years, respectively. In a subgroup of 103 patients with a statistically low operative risk, 1, 2 and 3-year survival was 77%, 71% und 61%, respectively (Figure 5). As a mechanism of action the skeletal muscle wrap exerts some active improvement of systolic wall motion of the heart/skeletal muscle complex. However, probably more important is an acute and chronically persisting shift of the pressure-volume relation to the left. This process results in a ""reverse remodel",1,E

Patients then received latanoprost (once daily) for an 18-month follow-up period regardless of their initial treatment.; Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured over the 24-month treatment period, and any ocular-systemic symptoms or adverse events were evaluated.; Latanoprost significantly reduced (P < 0.001) IOP by approximately 8 mmHg from pretreatment values, and this reduction was maintained over the 24-month treatment period with no sign of upward drift. Latanoprost is apparently free of any systemic side effect. The most significant ocular side effect with latanoprost was an increase in iris pigmentation, which occurred in 51 patients.; Latanoprost, administered once daily, is effective and well tolerated for the long-term treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.",5,E

For migraine, flunarizine was compared to propranolol in 686 patients; for vertigo, flunarizine was compared to betahistine in 198 patients. The incidence of depression during follow-up in this study was significantly higher in the flunarizine group than in the propranolol group in the condition of migraine. There were no observations of an extrapyramidal syndrome. There was a suggestion that flunarizine has more benefits than propranolol in the condition of migraine, and that betahistine has more benefit than flunarizine in the condition of vertigo.

The aim of this study was to study the effects of the selective beta-1 blocker bisoprolol and of the ACE inhibitor captopril on cellular insulin action in hypertensive individuals. After washout, 12 mild to moderate essential hypertensives were randomized in a double-blind manner to 5 mg bisoprolol daily or 25 mg captopril twice daily for 8 weeks. Erythrocyte insulin binding and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase (TK) activity were measured before and after therapy. Both agents decreased diastolic blood pressure significantly (bisoprolol 96.5+/-0.9 to 87.8+/-3.1 mm Hg; captopril 96.5+/-0.9 to 91.5+/-1.8 mm Hg; P < .05). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin/glucose indices remained unchanged after both therapies, as did lipid profiles. Maximal insulin-stimulated TK activity, assessed by phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate poly-Glu80Tyr20, was significantly higher (P < .05) after bisoprolol treatment, but not after captopril treatment, when compared to placebo (bisoprolol 8.5+/-1.8; captopril 7.3+/-1.5; placebo: 6.4+/-1.3 pmol 32P-ATP/fmol bound insulin). However, captopril, but not bisoprolol, increased the sensitivity of the receptor TK activity, as measured by the half-maximal activity concentration (ED50). Specific insulin binding was not affected by these two agents. Thus, both captopril and bisoprolol may have favorable but different effects on TK activity and insulin action at the cellular level.",E,E

We examined medical claims data from the Pennsylvania Medicaid Management Information System to investigate compliance rates for four major antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and diuretics) and the health care costs associated with noncompliance. Multivariate analysis was used to relate antihypertensive drug class with compliance and variations in compliance with health care costs. The highest estimated rates of compliance were associated with ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists, and these rates were significantly greater than with beta-blockers and diuretics. Moreover, poor compliance was associated with higher health care costs. Efforts to increase compliance with antihypertensive drug therapy are needed to improve patient outcomes and reduce health care costs.",E,E

Perioperative atenolol administration reduces the risk of death for as long as 2 yr after surgery. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial tested the hypothesis that perioperative atenolol administration reduces the incidence and severity of perioperative myocardial ischemia, potentially explaining the observed reduction in the risk for death.; Two-hundred patients with, or at risk for, coronary artery disease were randomized to two study groups (atenolol and placebo). Monitoring included a preoperative history and physical examination and daily assessment of any adverse events. Twelve-lead electrocardiography (ECG), three-lead Holter ECG, and creatinine phosphokinase with myocardial banding (CPK with MB) data were collected 24 h before until 7 days after surgery. Atenolol (0, 5, or 10 mg) or placebo was administered intravenously before induction of anesthesia and every 12 h after operation until the patient could take oral medications. Atenolol (0, 50, or 100 mg) was administered orally once a day as specified by blood pressure and heart rate.; During the postoperative period, the incidence of myocardial ischemia was significantly reduced in the atenolol group: days 0-2 (atenolol 17 of 99 patients; placebo, 34 of 101 patients; P = 0.008) and days 0-7 (atenolol, 24 of 99 patients; placebo, 39 of 101 patients; P = 0.029). Patients with episodes of myocardial ischemia were more likely to die in the next 2 yr (P = 0.025).; Perioperative administration of atenolol for 1 week to patients at high risk for coronary artery disease significantly reduces the incidence of postoperative myocardial ischemia.

The hypertension was defined as severe, resulting in stroke before age 50 years, featuring normal renin, aldosterone, and catecholamine responses, and did not appear to be salt-sensitive. The responsible gene resides on chromosome 12p. To determine which medications were most effective, we performed a prospective clinical trial. We studied 13 affected individuals in a randomized double-blind, cross-over trial including a beta-blocker (BBL), alpha-blocker (ABL), calcium channel blocker (CCB), converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) and placebo (PLA). We then added moxonidine (MOX) and continued the trial for an additional period in a single-blind fashion. Each drug was given for four weeks with an option to double the dose after two weeks; each washout period comprised two weeks. Blood, 24-hour urine, and saliva were studied at the outset, and blood and urine samples were obtained at the end of each phase. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate measurements were with the patient ambulatory at 24 hours. All regimens required doubled doses at two weeks. Beta blocker, CCB, CEI, and ABL lowered BP (6 to 10 mm Hg) and BP load compared to PLA, while HCT and MOX did not. Converting enzyme inhibitor and HCT increased plasma renin activity (PRA), while BBL lowered PRA. The 24-hour urine analysis indicated a high dietary salt intake with a low potassium and calcium intake. The salivary electrolytes showed similar sodium and potassium concentrations, while chloride values were significantly higher in affected than nonaffected subjects. Thus, this monogenic form of hypertension resembles nonsalt-sensitive essential hypertension in that BBL, CCB, CEI, and ABL were effective, while HCT was not. The BP reduction was similar to other single drug trials in essential hypertension. The high salivary chloride values suggest an additional intermediary phenotype that may be related to electrolyte transport. These results raise the possibility that an as yet unknown hypertensive mechanism is operative in these subjects.",E,E

The doses were adjusted if beta-blockade was inadequate or excessive. AF occurred in 16 (16%) of 98 sotalol patients and in 30 (32%) of 93 metoprolol patients (p < 0.01). Symptoms related to beta-blockade or proarrhythmia did not appear. After CABG, sinus heart rate increased in both groups (p < 0.001) but less in the sotalol patients (p < 0.001) throughout the postoperative period. Corrected QT duration (by the Bazett equation) was prolonged after the operation in both groups (p < 0.001), whereas uncorrected QT duration at similar heart-rate levels were prolonged only in sotalol patients (mean increase, 31 ms; 95% confidence interval, 2042 ms; p < 0.01). Uncorrected QT durations at similar heart-rate levels were longer during sotalol (compared with metoprolol) treatment (p < 0.05). Heart rates or QT durations did not differ between the patients with or without AF. In conclusion, sotalol significantly reduces the incidence of AF after CABG. Although a marked class III effect is demonstrated with relatively low doses (as prolonged ventricular repolarization) in direct comparison unbiased by any rate correction, its contribution as an enhanced antifibrillatory mechanism in the postoperative state remains unconfirmed.",I,E

Moreover, treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents showed an independent and significant negative relation with plasma IL-6 levels. In 100 patients, plasma IL-6 (p < 0.0001), NE (p = 0.0004) and left ventricular ejection fraction (0.015) were significant independent prognostic predictors by Cox proportional hazards analysis.; Our findings indicate that the IL-6 spillover in the peripheral circulation increases with the severity of CHF and that the increase in plasma IL-6 is mainly associated with the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. High plasma levels of IL-6 can provide prognostic information in patients with CHF, independent of left ventricular ejection fraction and plasma NE, suggesting an important role for IL-6 in the pathophysiology of CHF.",E,E

The choice between the two drugs appeared not to be influenced by age (62 +/- 11 vs 57 +/- 8 years), anterior (70% vs 57%) or inferior (30% vs 40%) MI location or echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (50.2 +/- 10% vs 52.3 +/- 11%), which were comparable in both groups. On the other hand, beta-blockers were used significantly more often (52% vs 10%; p < 0.05) in the presence of hypertension, while verapamil was preferred (although statistical significance was not reached) in patients with contraindications to beta-blockers, such as chronic obstructive lung disease or peripheral artery disease (20% vs 9% and 10% vs 4%; p = ns, respectively).; In conclusion, our study gives, for the first time, an estimate of the real use of verapamil in patients with MI, confirming, in keeping with the indications in the literature, that its administration is limited and essentially reserved to patients with contraindications to beta-blockers. A wider use of verapamil (and even more of beta-blockers) would be however hoped for, due to the relevant number of patients (62% of our population) treated with drugs, such as diltiazem, dihydropyridines or nitrates, for which a conclusive demonstration of efficacy on major clinical end-points are lacking.",1,E

However recent data have also suggested that such an effect might increase mortality due to an increased incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. We identified 43 subjects from general practice with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension to compare the effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine with that of the beta-blocker atenolol on platelet function, plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels, fibrinolysis, and serum lipids in a randomised double-blind parallel group study. After careful evaluation to exclude concomitant aspirin use, only 24 subjects were eligible to enter the study. While isradipine and atenolol produced comparable and clinically significant falls in blood pressure (167 +/- 2/102 +/- 1 to 153 +/- 3/91 +/- 2 mm Hg, and 165 +/- 2/101 +/- 1 to 156 +/- 4/91 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively), neither drug produced a detectable effect on ex vivo platelet aggregation, platelet retention, or thromboxane generation with adrenaline, collagen, adenosine-di-phosphate, or platelet activating factor. However a decrease in plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels was observed which reached statistical significance (P < 0.05) after 12 weeks treatment in the isradipine but not the atenolol group. A 39% reduction with isradipine compared with 34% following atenolol treatment. Euglobulin clot lysis time was not altered by either drug. Serum cholesterol concentrations were also unaltered by drug treatment. Therapeutic doses of the calcium antagonist isradipine may produce a minor indirect effect on platelet function after several weeks of treatment. However, this is of doubtful clinical importance and may simply reflect an effect of lowered blood pressure on platelet function.",E,E

It was the aim of this study to investigate if there are disturbances in the development of fetal behavioural states and if possible disturbances are due to poor fetal growth or to antihypertensive therapy. Our results show that in PIH treated by antihypertensive drugs, there are disturbances in the development of fetal behavioural states with higher percentages of NOC and C1F, lower percentages of C2F, and higher UA RI values. These disturbances are mainly due to coexisting placental impairment and poor fetal growth rather than to nifedipine or labetalol therapy, although these drugs may cause some redistribution of states.",E,E

NSAID users showed less decline, with younger subjects seeming to benefit more than older. We found no relationship between NSAID use and time taken to complete the Trail Making Test and also no relationship between anti-indigestion drug use and either cognitive outcome. These analyses highlight the need for larger studies with prospective classification of NSAID use and adequate control of confounding, including exposure to other medications.

Non-Q-wave infarction developed in 409 patients (20%) after thrombolytic therapy. Compared with Q-wave patients, non-Q-wave patients were more likely to present with lesser ST-segment elevation in a nonanterior location. The infarct-related artery in non-Q-wave patients was more likely to be nonanterior (67% versus 58%, P=.012) and distally located (33% versus 39%, P=.021).

Suppose that an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis shows a significant difference between the randomized groups. We may want to ask questions about the reason for such a difference in outcome between randomized groups: for example, was the difference due to different policies for change to a third more beneficial regime? We address such questions using the semi-parametric accelerated life models of Robins, which exploit the randomization assumption fully and avoid direct comparisons of possibly differently selected subgroups. No assumption is made about the relationship of treatment actually prescribed to prognosis. A sensitivity analysis, using a range of plausible values for the causal effect of a covariate, estimates the contrasts between randomized groups that would have been observed if the covariate had universally been 0. The main technical problem is in dealing with censoring, for the method requires different degrees of recensoring for different values of the causal effect, and this can lead to estimates of low precision. The methods are applied to a randomized comparison of two anti-hypertensive treatments in which approximately half the subjects changed treatment during follow-up. Various time-dependent covariates, representing patterns of side-effects and treatments, are used in the model. We find that the observed difference in cardiovascular deaths between the randomized groups cannot be explained in this way by their different covariate patterns.",E,E

Patients have been randomized to receive either conventional antihypertensive therapy (diuretics and/or beta-blockers) or captopril-based treatment. A prospective, randomized, open, blinded-endpoint evaluation (PROBE) study design is used to compare these two therapeutic regimens as regards cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The rationale for the CAPPP Study are the many observations of beneficial effects of ACE inhibition, as compared to diuretics and beta-blockers, on intermediary endpoints such as insulin sensitivity, serum lipoproteins, left ventricular hypertrophy and renal function. Captopril has also been shown to be markedly effective in the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction as well as congestive heart failure. The hypothesis is that these differences might result in improved risk reduction when ACE inhibitors are used in the treatment of hypertension. The present paper describes the baseline data and the changes in blood pressure during the first year in the total cohort. During the first year the average blood pressure was reduced by 11/8 mm Hg. A number of substudies have been conducted in the CAPPP Study. In one of these insulin sensitivity was compared in a subgroup of the patients using the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. In another substudy the ACE gene was sequenced and some new polymorphisms were discovered. Several other substudies are in progress or in the planning phase. The main results of the CAPPP Study should be available by mid-1998. Some of the intended anayses of the final results as well as other planned substudies are briefly described here.",E,E

The incidence of asymptomatic AAA seems to be increasing, although exact incidence estimates vary. The most important risk factors for AAA are male sex, age, family history and smoking. Hypertension is associated with a mildly increased risk, but diabetes is not associated with any increase. Primary prevention of AAA is not a realistic option. There is no evidence of an effective medical treatment to prevent growth of small AAAs, although trials with propranolol are under way. The only intervention to prevent death from aneurysm is elective repair of the asymptomatic lesion. Screening for asymptomatic AAA can reduce the incidence of rupture. However, further studies are needed to determine the cost effectiveness of screening compared with that of other health programmes.",E,E

We report this very rare syndrome in a patient with pectoral implanted unipolar cardioverter defibrillator. This syndrome was detected because the patient presented in the 3 month routine visit an exitblock with an increased pacing impedance. The defibrillation threshold remained unchanged. The chest x-ray revealed an inferolaterally migrated generator with a multiply rotated lead. The intraoperative exploration showed a generator which was rotated nine-fold around its longitudinal axis with a multiple twisted unipolar lead. The lead was substituted and the aggregate fixed with a suture to the underlying muscle fascia. An atrophy of the pectoralis muscle was found in this patient which previously resulted from a long hospital stay. This atrophy was identified as a possible risk factor for the development of Twiddler's syndrome. This report illustrates that Twiddler's syndrome, a rare complication in patients with pectoral ICD, may become a significant problem in these patients as it is for pacemaker patients but with more serious possible consequences.",E,E

Time-dependent Cox regression analysis was used to determine correlation between the incidence of CHD and entry characteristics, the monitored serum levels of cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and the development of diabetes mellitus. Univariate analysis showed the presence of diabetes mellitus a entry to the study and increased baseline serum concentrations of cholesterol and of triglycerides each to be a significant predictor of CHD, the respective relative risks (RR) being 2.12, 1.21 and 1.21. However, analysis of monitored levels of metabolic variables during follow-up showed only an increased serum cholesterol concentration to be significantly and independently associated with CHD (RR 1.07). Although serum triglyceride concentrations increased slightly during follow-up, they were unrelated to the incidence of CHD; nor was onset of diabetes mellitus during follow-up significantly associated with an increased risk of CHD (RR 1.48.

Fifty patients, aged 46.3+/-8 (mean+/-SD) years, with newly diagnosed or poorly controlled essential hypertension were randomized to treatment with either isradipine or hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride. Atenolol and hydralazine were added in both groups as secondary and tertiary drugs, respectively, when needed for normalization of diastolic blood pressure. A subcutaneous gluteal biopsy was taken surgically before medication and again after 9 months of successful antihypertensive treatment. Two small resistance arteries were isolated from each biopsy and mounted in a Mulvany-Halpem isometric small vessel myograph. The media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio (percentage) of the vessels was measured under standardized conditions and meaned. Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was determined by echocardiography according to the Penn convention. Ten patients were treated with isradipine as monotherapy, whereas only one patient was well controlled on diuretics as monotherapy. Mean blood pressure was reduced equally with the two regimens, from 131+/-9 mm Hg to 101+/-10 mm Hg with the isradipine and from 128+/-9 mm Hg to 99+/-7 mm Hg with the thiazide/atenolol regimen. LVM decreased significantly in both groups by 130+/-75 g with the isradipine-based regimen and by 70+/-53 g with the hydrochlorothiazide/atenolol-based regimen. The reduction of LVM was significantly greater on the isradipine-based regimen than on the thiazide-based regimen (P < .01). There was a significant reduction of media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio during treatment with the isradipine-based regimen from 10.9% to 8.8% (P < .01). The reduction in the thiazide regimen was from 9.7% to 8.5%, which was not significant (P = .07).

Eighteen patients were randomized in a double-blind, crossover fashion to receive each of the four different medications for 8 weeks. ABPM was performed at baseline and after an 8-week treatment with these medications. A 2- to 3-week washout period occurred both at baseline and between each of the four medications. Three patients were omitted from statistical analysis because of technical problems of ABPM.

There was with nebivolol no overall deterioration of cardiac function or cardiac symptoms, and especially not of exercise capacity, in comparison with placebo. One patient on nebivolol 2.5 mg developed hypotension and pulmonary edema, and one patient on nebivolol 5 mg, bradycardia. All the remaining patients continued with unchanged diuretic and digitalis dosage. Nebivolol was accompanied by a trend toward clinical and functional improvement; rather better results were obtained with 2.5 than 5.0 mg.; In view of increasing interest in beta-blockade in heart failure, nebivolol merits further study in this context. The capacity of nebivolol to enhance endothelial nitric oxide production appears potentially attractive.",E,E

Efficacy was determined by change from baseline in blood pressure and by therapeutic response rates. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs). Both treatments significantly lowered blood pressure from baseline. There were no significant differences between treatment groups with respect to blood pressure changes or therapeutic response. Atenolol significantly reduced seated heart rate compared with irbesartan at Week 12. The incidences of serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were approximately twice as high in the atenolol group compared with the irbesartan group.

Of the 228 patients enrolled, 100 patients (54/111 doxazosin and 46/117 atenolol) completed the 5-year study. Both treatments were similarly efficacious in controlling blood pressure. As assessed by the Framingham risk equation, which incorporates lipid parameter values, patients receiving doxazosin had significantly less chance of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) within 10 years compared with those patients receiving atenolol (p < 0.05). Doxazosin significantly (p=0.0005) reduced the mean CHD risk from baseline to final visit by 12.3%; whereas, atenolol produced essentially no change in mean risk (0.2% increase). In patients receiving doxazosin, statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases from baseline were observed in serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and the HDL/total cholesterol ratio during the first 2 and 3 years of treatment, respectively. In contrast, significant (p < 0.05) percent reductions from baseline in both these lipid parameters were seen in atenolol-treated patients during most of the 5-year trial.

Triglycerides, however, significantly increased with atenolol treatment (p < 0.0001 vs baseline) while remaining essentially unchanged with doxazosin treatment.

After 4 weeks of treatment a comparison was made between the once daily administered doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg as well as with placebo. The primary parameter was the mean diastolic blood pressure between 8.00 and 22.00 (dTMW). Furthermore, the duration of action of the once daily administration of 200 mg talinolol was compared with the twice daily application of 100 mg each. With regard to dTMW an increasing antihypertensive effect was determined for the dosage step from 50 mg to 100 mg talinolol/d. No further increase in the blood pressure lowering effect was observed with 200 mg talinolol/d. The highest frequency of therapy responders was found in the 100 mg group with 72.2%. Moreover it could be demonstrated, that within the dosage range of 1 x 100-200 mg Talinolol/d a significant and 24 h lasting reduction of blood pressure and pulse rate was achieved, including the early morning period. There were no differences between the blood pressure profile of the 200 mg group and the 2 x 100 mg group at the end of the 4 weeks treatment. All talinolol dosages investigated in this study were proved to be safe and well tolerated. The observed complaints classified as adverse drug reactions represented typical side effects of beta-blockers of mild to moderate intensity. It can be concluded from the results that the once daily intake of talinolol in the dosage range of 100-200 mg/d shows a reliable efficacy in the treatment of essential hypertension accompanied by a noncritical safety profile.",1,E

CHF causes disturbances in ventilation and pulmonary gas transfer (stress failure of alveolar-capillary membrane) that participate in limiting VO2p. Carvedilol improves LV function and not VO2p. Twenty-one NYHA functional class II-III patients were randomized (2 to 1) to carvedilol (25 mg bid., 14 patients) or placebo (7 patients) for 6 months. Rest forced expiratory volume (FEV1), vital capacity (VC), total lung capacity (TLC), carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO), its alveolar-capillary membrane component (DM), pulmonary venous and transmitral flows (for monitoring changes in LV end-diastolic pressure, EDP), LV diastolic (EDD) and systolic (ESD) dimensions, stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF), fiber shortening velocity (VCF) were measured at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. VO2p, peak ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VTp), ventilatory equivalent for CO2 production (VE/VCO2), VO2 at anaerobic threshold (VO2at) were also determined.

Carvedilol reduced EDP, EDD, ESD, and increased EF, SV, VCF, without affecting VO2p, VO2at, VD/VTp, VE/VCO2, at 3 and 6 months. Placebo was ineffective. In CHF, carvedilol exerts neutral effects on ventilation and pulmonary gas transfer and ameliorates LV function at rest. This proves that antifailure treatment may not be similarly effective on cardiac and pulmonary function; and does not contradict the possibility that persistence of lung impairment may contribute to lack of improvement in exercise performance with carvedilol.",1,E

After a 9-month treatment, systolic, diastolic and pulse pressures and radial artery wall thickness, mass and thickness/radius ratio decreased significantly (p < 0.01), whereas carotid compliance increased (p < 0.001). The decrease in radial artery thickness/radius ratio after a 9-month treatment was significantly related to the reduction in pulse pressure (p < 0.01), whereas the improvement in carotid compliance was related to the reduction in mean arterial pressure (p < 0.01). In healthy subjects and untreated hypertensive patients, radial artery diameter, wall thickness and thickness/radius ratio and carotid artery compliance did not change significantly during a 9-month observation period.; These results indicate that in elderly hypertensive patients, both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor- and diuretic combination-based treatments can reduce radial artery wall hypertrophy and improve carotid artery compliance.",E,E

When first evaluated (2 weeks-1 month), peak A wave velocity and atrial filling ratio were higher in group 2 than in group 1 (37 +/- 10 cm/s vs 20 +/- 5 cm/s and 23% +/- 7 vs 13% +/- 5, respectively) and group 1 had also a lower exercise tolerance (80 +/- 25 W vs 110 +/- 10 W). There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 in left atrial and left ventricular dimensions, ejection fraction and E wave deceleration time. After 1 month there were no significant differences in Doppler characteristics, echocardiographic parameters and exercise tolerance between the two groups. Group 1 remained at a lower heart rate and had a lower maximal double product (17250 mmHg/min vs 22100 mmHg/min) corresponding to a lower cardiac work. At 3 and 6 months there were no significant changes in all characteristics between the two groups. In conclusion, sotalol seems to be a well tolerated antiarrhythmic agent in patients with mild heart failure, after conversion of persistent atrial fibrillation. In this setting: 1. Sotalol could reversibly amplify the effect of atrial stunning after electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, but this effect is brief. 2. Sotalol has no relevant negative inotropic effect, at least not in association with captopril. 3. Sotalol improves the effort capacity.",E,E

The cirrhotics were evaluated prior to and after ingestion of propranolol (60 mg twice daily for seven days) or placebo in a randomized cross-over fashion. Variations in heart rate, blood pressure, portal vein diameter, and portal venous flow and velocity were evaluated.; The mean (SD) portal venous flow in the volunteers was 746 (280) mL/min, portal flow velocity was 18.5 (3.6) cm/s and portal vein diameter was 9.2 (1.4) mm. In cirrhotics, propranolol decreased portal blood flow from 586 (220) to 413 (120) mL/min (p < 0.03), the overall reduction being 29.5%. This effect was due to decrease in portal flow velocity, from 12.5 (3.3) to 9.7 (2.3) cm/s (p < 0.03) without significant change in portal vein diameter. No changes were observed with placebo.; Propranolol decreases portal flow velocity and thus portal venous flow in cirrhotics.",E,E

Out of consecutive 107 live related donor renal transplant, complete data available for 74 patients between June 1991 and March 1993, were entered in proforma and analysed. On the basis of antihypertensive or no antihypertensive drugs prescribed, patients were grouped in 6 categories. Group I patients taking no antihypertensives were taken as control. All patients were comparable for their age, sex, weight, immunosuppressive therapy, anaesthetic and fluid management during surgery. At the time of induction of anaesthesia, patients taking atenolol (plasma K+ levels being 5.34 +/- 0.75 mmol/l in group II and 5.44 +/- 0.63 mmol/l in group III) or captopril (serum K+ level being 5.05 +/- 0.94 mmol/l in group V) in combination with nifedipine and with or without clonidine had significant hyperkalaemia than the patient without antihypertensives (serum K+ level being 4.49 +/- 0.71 mmol/l). Patients, on these two antihypertensives, frequently needed active treatment of alarming hyperkalaemia (blood K+ more than 5 mmol/l and tall 'T' wave in lead II) and cardiac arrhythmias. In conclusion, ESRD patients taking atenolol or captopril are needed to be frequently monitored for blood potassium levels and it would be advisable to avoid these drugs to control hypertension in ESRD patients, especially, when scheduled for renal transplantation.",E,E

The aim of the present study was to examine serum levels of aspartate, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine, serine, glycine, threonine, histidine, alanine, taurine and arginine in major depression patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). No significant differences in the serum concentrations of any of the above amino acids could be found between patients with and without TRD and normal controls. Non-responders to treatment with antidepressants during a period of 5 weeks were characterized by significantly lower serum levels of aspartate, asparagine, serine, threonine and taurine. A 5-week period of treatment with antidepressants significantly reduced the serum levels of aspartate, glutamate and taurine, and significantly increased the serum concentrations of glutamine. The results suggest that alterations in serum levels of aspartate, asparagine, serine, threonine and taurine may predict the subsequent response to treatment with antidepressants, and that the latter may modulate serum levels of excitatory amino acids and taurine.",E,E

The primary aim of the Fosinopril Versus Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Randomized Trial (FACET) was to compare the effects of fosinopril and amlodipine on serum lipids and diabetes control in NIDDM patients with hypertension. Prospectively defined cardiovascular events were assessed as secondary outcomes.; Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of NIDDM and hypertension (systolic blood pressure of > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of > 90 mmHg). Exclusion criteria included a history of coronary heart disease or stroke, serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl, albuminuria > 40 micrograms/min, and use of lipid-lowering drugs, aspirin, or antihypertensive agents other than beta-blockers or diuretics. A total of 380 hypertensive diabetics were randomly assigned to open-label fosinopril (20 mg/day) or amlodipine (10 mg/day) and followed for up to 3.5 years. If blood pressure was not controlled, the other study drug was added.; Both treatments were effective in lowering blood pressure. At the end of follow-up, between the two groups there was no significant difference in total serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, HbA1c, fasting serum glucose, or plasma insulin. The patients receiving fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of the combined outcome of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalized angina than those receiving amlodipine (14/189 vs. 27/191; hazards ratio = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.26-0.95).; Fosinopril and amlodipine had similar effects on biochemical measures, but the patients randomized to fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of major vascular events, compared with the patients randomized to amlodipine.",E,E

A 4-week run-in placebo period preceded the active 12-week treatment with perindopril (4-8 mg daily) or carvedilol (25-50 mg daily). Endothelial functions were assessed by evaluating the hemodynamic (mean blood pressure, leg blood flow) and rheological (platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and blood filterability) responses to an intravenous bolus of 3 g L-arginine, the natural precursor of nitric oxide.; Both perindopril and carvedilol significantly reduced mean blood pressure (P < 0.001) and increased leg blood flow (P < 0.05) to the same extent; blood filterability remained unchanged in both perindopril- and carvedilol-treated groups. Carvedilol reduced platelet aggregation and blood viscosity significantly (P < 0.05) but perindopril did not. Before treatment, the hemodynamic and rheologic responses to L-arginine were significantly lower in patients (P < 0.05-0.01) than in 20 nondiabetic nonhypertensive control subjects. After 12 weeks of treatment, both drugs normalized the hemodynamic responses to L-arginine. Platelet aggregation response to L-arginine was ameliorated by carvedilol and remained unchanged in the perindopril group.; At the doses used, both drugs effectively reduce blood pressure and normalize the hemodynamic responses to L-arginine.

The association with atypical chest pain and migraine headache was also investigated. Over the 16 years of follow-up there were 130 men and 171 women who developed primary RP. The prevalence in women (9.6%) was somewhat higher than in men (8.1%) and 81.4% of the RP was primary. Secondary RP was equally prevalent in men (18.6%) and women (19.7%).

Moreover, such patients generally do not tolerate beta-blockade, a promising new therapy for chronic heart failure. Positive inotropes, including phosphodiesterase inhibitors, are associated with increased mortality when administered over the long term in these patients. The addition of a beta-blocker to positive inotropic therapy might attenuate this adverse effect, although long-term oral inotropic therapy might serve as a bridge to beta-blockade.; Thirty patients with severe heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 17.2+/-1.2%, cardiac index 1.6+/-0.1 liter/min per m2) were treated with the combination of oral enoximone (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and oral metoprolol at two institutions. Enoximone was given at a dose of < or = 1 mg/kg body weight three times a day. After clinical stabilization, metoprolol was initiated at 6.25 mg twice a day and slowly titrated up to a target dose of 100 to 200 mg/day.; Ninety-six percent of the patients tolerated enoximone, whereas 80% tolerated the addition of metoprolol. The mean duration of combination therapy was 9.4+/-1.8 months. The mean length of follow-up was 20.9+/-3.9 months.

We review the evidence for benefit in diabetic patients, of the major drug groups used as secondary prevention. Beta blockers: meta-analyses suggest a reduction in mortality of 35% with beta blockers. Diabetic patients should receive beta blockers post myocardial infarction. In many patients, the benefits of beta blockers will outweigh relative contraindications. Aspirin: meta-analyses of antiplatelet therapy in high-risk subjects have shown substantial benefits. Aspirin should be prescribed for secondary prevention. Lipid lowering with statins: subgroup analyses of the major secondary prevention trials show substantial benefits across a wide range of baseline cholesterol and LDL levels. These drugs should be prescribed as secondary prevention to patients with diabetes whose total cholesterol is > 4.0 mmol(-1). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs): the few subgroup analyses that exist from ACEI trials suggest that diabetic and non-diabetic patients derive similar benefits. Diabetic subjects who have systolic dysfunction after myocardial infarction should receive ACEIs. Treatment combination: data exist to suggest that most of these drugs produce benefit independently.; diabetic patients benefit from secondary prevention with drug treatment as much as, or more than, non-diabetic patients.",I,8

The FDA requires only that blood pressure be controlled safely, but current evidence-based medicine demands answers to the mortality/morbidity question. We need this outcome trial information on all the classes of antihypertensives, including calcium channel blockers. For example, we often rely on surrogate endpoints such as control of blood pressure or control of PVCs. If we treat hypertensives with PVCs using beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, we may see both control of blood pressure and suppression of PVCs. However, as we learned from the CAST trial with flecainide and encainide, PVCs can be controlled, but mortality may increase. On the other hand, the Lewis trial demonstrated that captopril, an ACE inhibitor, reduced proteinuria, which is another surrogate endpoint in diabetic hypertensives with nephropathy, although blood pressure was controlled with diuretic and conventional therapy. Importantly, captopril also reduced morbidity and mortality without influencing blood pressure. Unfortunately, there are no outcome trials measuring mortality endpoints for most of the antihypertensive agents in use today, especially in patients with uncomplicated hypertension.",I,8

The mean heart rate on ambulatory monitoring provides a more robust statistic for clinical use. We examined the relationship between mean heart rate on initial referral ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to the BP-lowering efficacy of the four main groups of anti-hypertensive medications, in a referral hypertensive population. Patients were retrospectively identified by review of the BP database, and data collected from the initial referral BP monitor off medication, and the subsequent ABPM after treatment with either beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The change in mean arterial BP from the initial to the subsequent ABPM (ie, as a result of treatment) was correlated with the mean heart rate on the initial ABPM. A moderate association was found for initial daytime heart rate and BP response to beta-blockers (r = 0.24, P = 0.02), and ACE inhibitors (r = 0.14, P = 0.05). No such association was found for calcium antagonists or diuretics. When the groups were divided into those with a mean daytime heart rate <75 and > or =75 beats per min, BP reduction from beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy was significantly greater in those patients with a higher daytime heart rate. We conclude that average daytime heart rate on pre-treatment ABPM can be useful as a predictor of BP response to beta-blockade or ACE inhibition.",E,E

Once daily administration of moexipril 7.5 or 15 mg effectively reduces blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension (including the elderly and postmenopausal women with this condition). In double-blind randomised comparative studies, moexipril 7.5 to 15 mg once daily showed similar efficacy to other antihypertensive agents, including captopril, hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, metoprolol, sustained release verapamil and nitrendipine. Combined therapy with hydrochlorothiazide and moexipril had a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either agent alone. Moexipril is well tolerated by the majority of patients and compares well in this respect with other antihypertensive agents. Its tolerability profile appears to be characteristic of ACE inhibitors as a class (the most common adverse events being headache, symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection and cough). Moexipril generally had no clinically significant effect on lipid, glucose or electrolyte metabolism or haematological parameters, and, in particular, it was not associated with any significant changes in lipid or glucose metabolism in postmenopausal women (with or without hormone replacement therapy).; Once daily moexipril is a useful agent for the treatment of essential hypertension, which compares well with currently available options in terms of clinical efficacy and tolerability. In addition, clinical experience to date supports its use in postmenopausal women.",E,E

The modest protection against myocardial infarction conferred by these compounds in primary-preventive studies has suggested that beneficial effects of beta-blockade are counteracted by known adverse influences on lipid and glucose metabolism. As most beta-blockers increase plasma triglycerides and decrease the high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration, a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study was conducted to evaluate whether a 12-week treatment with metoprolol (100 mg o.d.) or placebo affected the metabolism of postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in 15 middle-aged men with a modestly increased cardiovascular risk. Metoprolol treatment significantly increased the postprandial responses of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and VLDL remnants to a mixed meal-type of oral fat tolerance test. The effect was particularly prominent for larger (Svedberg flotation rate (Sf) > 400 and Sf 60-400) particle species (P < 0.001 in repeated measures ANOVA), whereas the smaller (Sf 20-60) particles were less affected (P < 0.05). The changes in the postprandial responses of the different VLDL species were mainly related to an effect on the fasting plasma concentrations, with limited or no influences on VLDL catabolism during the postprandial state. In contrast, metoprolol treatment did not significantly influence the postprandial responses of chylomicrons and chylomicron remnants. Notably, the enhanced fasting and postprandial triglyceridaemia during metoprolol treatment was neither accompanied by a rise in fasting or postprandial free fatty acid concentrations, nor by alterations of the glucose and insulin responses to a standard oral glucose challenge. The ensuing shift in the LDL particle size distribution towards smaller particles was limited (fraction small LDL: metoprolol 22.8 +/- 15.7% versus placebo 19.3 +/- 15.0%, P < 0.05). In conclusion, metoprolol treatment primarily enhances fasting and postprandial triglyceridaemia in middle-aged men by increasing the basal hepatic production of VLDL.",I,E

This study was undertaken (1) to define the clinical and arteriographic features associated with CAD among diabetics and nondiabetics with LEAD and (2) to determine the long-term survival and predictors of mortality of diabetics and nondiabetics with LEAD and CAD.; Two hundred sixty-three diabetics and 1137 nondiabetics from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study who had evidence of LEAD, who were 50 years and older, and who had arteriographically proven CAD were monitored for a mean of 12.8 years.; Among all the subjects with LEAD there was a high prevalence of current and past smoking, history of previous myocardial infarction, systemic hypertension, congestive heart failure, high degrees of angina pectoris and unstable angina pectoris, and use of beta-blockers. On arteriographic evaluation a high prevalence of three-vessel epicardial coronary disease and involvement of multiple coronary segments with > or =50% diameter narrowing was found. Multivariate analysis showed the number of coronary segments with >50% occlusion, the presence of cerebrovascular disease, the use of digitalis, and elevated systolic blood pressure were independently associated with diabetes. On follow-up diabetics had a significantly higher mortality rate (mostly cardiac) than nondiabetics: median survival, 8.1 years and 12.7 years, respectively. At 15 years the mortality rates were 77.1% and 62.0%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, age, number of coronary occlusions, number of significantly narrowed epicardial arteries, diminished myocardial contractility, hypertension, and smoking were significant predictors of mortality in the total group and in each subgroup. Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery was protective. The presence of diabetes was an independent risk factor for mortality.; The presence of LEAD is associated with multivessel epicardial and multiple coronary segment occlusion. On long-term follow-up there is a high mortality rate. In patients with LEAD and diabetes, CAD is especially severe and prognosis is poor.",E,E

Patients were treated with hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, prazosin, or placebo for up to 2 years. Heart rates were measured at baseline, the end of titration, 1 year, and 2 years. Data were also stratified by baseline heart rate. A subset of patients had heart rate also determined by electrocardiogram. All drugs except prazosin reduced heart rate from baseline; additional small decreases were obtained over time with hydrochlorothiazide and placebo. The decrease initially achieved with clonidine was attenuated over time. The overall reduction in heart rate was greatest for atenolol (-12.2 beats/min) and least for prazosin (+3.8 beats/min). Only atenolol effected a further reduction of heart rate for patients whose baseline rate was < or =65 beats/min. All drugs reduced heart rate when the baseline was > or =85 beats/min. Data derived by electrocardiogram yielded similar results.

We analyzed results from 24 hypertensive patients (30-68 years of age) with adequate blood-pressure lowering on monotherapy. Acutely, both drugs lowered systolic blood pressure and heart rate. Whereas metoprolol reduced cardiac output and increased both systemic and femoral artery resistance, carvedilol did not alter cardiac output but led to reductions in the systemic and regional resistances. After 4 weeks of therapy, cardiac output remained reduced and vascular resistances increased in the metoprolol group, whereas in carvedilol patients cardiac output continued to be unchanged and the trend for vascular resistances to be decreased persisted. Acutely and chronically the differences in the hemodynamic effects of the two medications were statistically significant. The study results indicate that carvedilol's vasodilatory action is not subject to tolerance development. Chronic afterload reduction associated with the decrease in systemic vascular resistance may lead to additional savings in myocardial oxygen consumption, a beneficial feature particularly in those patients with concomitant ischemic heart disease. It may also have a favorable influence on concentric cardiac hypertrophy and changes in the walls of arteriolar resistance vessels.",E,E

We performed a cost-minimization analysis based on numbers-needed-to-treat (NNT) derived from the metaanalysis of 15 major clinical trials of hypertension treatment, and the average wholesale prices of both the most commonly prescribed and the least expensive drugs in each class. The inclusion criteria for clinical trials were that they be randomized, controlled trials of drug therapy of uncomplicated mild-to-moderate hypertension with stroke, MI, or death as endpoints. The wholesale drug costs and the total direct outpatient treatment costs to prevent a stroke, MI or death among middle-aged and elderly hypertensives were our outcome measures. The estimated wholesale drug acquisition cost to prevent one major event (MI or stroke or death) ranged from $4730 to $346,236 among middle-aged patients, and from $1595 to $116,754 in the elderly; generic diuretic or beta-blocker therapy was more economical than treatment with an ACEI, alpha-blocker, or CCB. The associated 5-year NNT was 86 for middle-aged patients and 29 for elderly patients. Diuretic therapy remained more cost-effective even under the unlikely assumption that the newer drugs were 50% more effective than diuretics at preventing these major events. The costs associated with potassium supplementation did not eliminate the advantage of diuretics. Treatment costs to prevent major hypertensive complications are much lower with diuretics and beta-blockers than with ACEI, CCB, or alpha-blockers, especially in middle-aged patients.",E,E

Among 11,575 patients with coronary artery disease screened for participation, but not included in the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) study, 3,225 (28%) were in NYHA classes II and III. In the latter group of patients we compared the prognosis of 1,109 (34%) treated with beta blockers with 2,116 counterparts not receiving beta-blocker therapy. After a mean follow-up of 4 years, all-cause and cardiac mortality rates were significantly lower among beta-blocker users, 9% and 5%, respectively, than among beta-blocker nonusers, 17% and 11%, respectively (p <0.01 for both). After multivariate adjustment, treatment with beta blockers was associated with a lower all-cause mortality risk (hazards ratio [HR] 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49 to 0.78), and a lower cardiac mortality risk (HR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.83) than was no treatment with a beta blocker. Lower total mortality risk was noted among patients in NYHA class II (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.82) and in NYHA class III (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.87) as well as in patients with (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.81) or without (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.09) a previous myocardial infarction. We conclude that beta-blocker therapy in coronary patients in NYHA classes II or III is safe and associated with a lower risk for all-cause and cardiac mortality.",E,E

ACE-inhibitors have been reported to be superior to most other antihypertensive drugs in inducing a regression of LVH. In a double-blind study with parallel groups, 50 patients with essential hypertension were randomized to treatment with either fosinopril (20 mg o.d.) or atenolol (50 mg o.d.) for 12-16 weeks. Left ventricle wall thickness (LVWT, defined as the sum of interventricular septum and posterior wall), diastolic function (represented by the ratio between the E-wave and the A-wave of mitral blood flow) and femoral artery blood flow (FBF) were evaluated using ultrasonic measurements. FBF was measured at normoinsulinemia and after 2 h of euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. Before treatment, the insulin-induced increase in FBF was inversely related to the LVWT (r = -0.52, p < 0.02). The reduction in ambulatory 24-h SBP/DBP was 13/9 mmHg for fosinopril and 15/14 for atenolol, ambulatory DBP being significantly more reduced by atenolol (p = 0.03 for difference in treatment effect). However, only fosinopril treatment resulted in a significant reduction in LVWT (from 20.5 mm to 19.4 mm, p < 0.05). The degree of reduction in LVWT was related to the increase in FBF in the fosinopril group (r = -0.45, p < 0.05). For fosinopril (but not for atenolol), there was a positive relationship between the change in E/A ratio and the change in femoral artery stroke volume (r = 0.80, p < 0.01).; Impaired insulin-induced stimulation of leg blood flow was related to an increased LVWT. Furthermore, during fosinopril treatment, regression of LVWT was associated with enhanced skeletal muscle blood flow during hyperinsulinemia. This indicates that impaired peripheral blood flow (and thereby increased afterload) may be a possible mechanism explaining the previously found association between insulin resistance and cardiovascular hypertrophy.",E,E

Both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been reported to increase vagal modulation of heart rate and baroreflex sensitivity, but the relations between the antihypertensive and vagal cardiac effects of these drugs have remained unclear in essential hypertension. In the present study we evaluated the effects of a 4-week crossover monotherapy with metoprolol and ramipril on spectrum analysis indices of heart rate variability in the supine rest and head-up tilted positions, baroreflex sensitivity (phenylephrine method), and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in 12 formerly untreated stage 1-2 essential hypertensive patients. Compared to the pretreatment values, both drugs decreased BP similarly and significantly. However, the drugs showed different effects on cardiac vagal activity: metoprolol increased significantly mean R-R interval, R-R interval total, and high-frequency variability at supine rest and baroreflex sensitivity, but ramipril did not significantly affect these variables. The metoprolol-induced decrease in ambulatory BP correlated with the prolongation of the R-R interval and the increase of high-frequency variability at supine rest. The present data show that 4-week treatment with metoprolol increases tonic and reflex vagal cardiac activity, whereas ramipril does not affect vagal cardiac control in essential hypertension. Increase in vagal activity may contribute to the BP-lowering effect of metoprolol in hypertensive patients.",E,E

A prospective randomized study was conducted in adult patients who previously derived no significant benefit from most conventional prophylactic therapy for migraine. Twenty-seven patients with a diagnosis of migraine with aura or migraine without aura from a headache clinic received low dose sodium valproate for 3 months. Response to therapy was defined as 50% or greater reduction in the frequency of headache. Plasma drug level monitoring helped to identify four noncompliers who were excluded from the study. Seventeen (71%) patients observed improvement within 4-6 weeks of medication and remained well for 12 weeks. They were further followed up for 12-24 months. Two patients for side effects and 1 for nondrug-related problems were withdrawn from follow-up study. Twelve patients (60%) maintained their response for 12 months or longer. Clinical improvement (percentage reduction in the frequency of migraine attacks) correlated inversely with the plasma drug levels at 13-24 months and daily dose of valproate, among the responders, suggestive of a possible therapeutic window. In other words, patients who do not respond to low dose valproate are unlikely to benefit from further increase in dosage.",E,E

9660523,The role of combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension.,"Antihypertensive Agents; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Hypertension; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Ruilope, L M; Coca, A","Antihypertensive therapy is indicated for reducing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that accompanies arterial hypertension. Usually, pharmacological treatment is started as monotherapy, which, if unsuccessful, is followed by sequential monotherapy, or by combination therapy. Recent data indicate that combination therapy is required in more than 50% of the hypertensive population when the goal is to reduce blood pressure to below 140/90 mm Hg. The choice and doses of drugs used in combination therapy should be such that their synergistic effect on blood pressure is maximized, the tolerability of the drugs is maintained and side-effects are minimized. The combination of a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a beta-blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is one of the most commonly used combination therapies. Two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group studies compared the antihypertensive effects of the dihydropyridine, barnidipine, with the beta-blocker, atenolol (n = 247), and the ACE inhibitor, enalapril (n = 155). The efficacy and tolerability of barnidipine in combination with either atenolol or enalapril was also investigated. Monotherapy with barnidipine was as effective in reducing blood pressure as monotherapy with either atenolol or enalapril. Combining barnidipine with either atenolol or enalapril reduced blood pressure further, and significantly increased the percentage of patients attaining the required reduction in blood pressure. When patients whose blood pressure was not adequately controlled by enalapril monotherapy were switched to barnidipine monotherapy, the majority then achieved the desired reduction in blood pressure. These results indicate that if barnidipine monotherapy fails to lower blood pressure to the desired values, its combination with either a beta-blocker or an ACE inhibitor is effective and well tolerated.",E,E

Metabolic indices measuring glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity were derived from minimal model analysis of the glucose and insulin profiles measured during the IVGTT. Indices of first- and second-phase insulin release were also calculated from the IVGTT insulin response. Atenolol had different metabolic effects on normal subjects and syndrome X patients. Despite the fact that the drug was found to be effective in relieving symptoms of chest pain, it induced a significant (p < 0.05) worsening of insulin resistance in syndrome X patients. No such effect was observed in control subjects. On the other hand, atenolol produced a marked reduction (40%, p < 0.05) of first-phase insulin release in control subjects, but no significant change of the same index in syndrome X patients.; These results show that betablockers are very effective for controlling symptoms and improving quality of life in syndrome X patients.

Similar results were obtained in the bopindolol group, apart from the triglycerides, which increased significantly (to 2.5 +/- 1.1 from 2.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l), probably because of the lower baseline concentration.

In placebo-treated patients, instead, these parameters were not significantly changed (329.1 +/- 76.5 vs 361.7 +/- 71.7, NS, and 324.6 +/- 79.7 vs 359.3 +/- 58.1, NS; 6.2 +/- 3.7 vs 7.3 +/- 3.7, NS, and 4.9 +/- 2.2 vs 6.1 +/- 3.2, NS; 9.8 +/- 6.3 vs 13.3 +/- 8.0, NS, and 9.0 +/- 6.2 vs 12.4 +/- 7.8, NS). Carvedilol confirmed a significant effect on myocardial ischemia and systemic hypertension. No significant side effects were reported. Ventricular arrhythmias are frequent in patients with end-stage renal disease maintained on hemodialysis. They are often due to an underlying cardiac disease, namely systemic hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary artery disease. The results of our study show that the antiarrhythmic effect of carvedilol is linked, at least partly, to an improvement of the underlying cardiac disease. Uremic patients have a chronic increase in adrenergic tone, with a direct correlation between norepinephrine plasmatic concentration and frequence of premature ventricular contractions. Beta-blockers are very important in these patients because of their modulation on the adrenergic system. They also reduce potassium flow, from extracellular to intracellular fluid. Therefore carvedilol can affect the sudden hypokalemia occurring in the first phase of hemodialysis treatment, that may be an important cause of intradialytic arrhythmias.",1,E
9679720,Effect of single-drug therapy on reduction of left atrial size in mild to moderate hypertension: comparison of six antihypertensive agents.,Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Double-Blind Method; Echocardiography; Heart Atria; Humans; Hypertension; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged,"Gottdiener, J S; Reda, D J; Williams, D W; Materson, B J; Cushman, W; Anderson, R J","Cardiac effects of hypertension include increased left ventricular (LV) mass and LV hypertrophy, as well as increased left atrial size, a predictor of stroke and atrial fibrillation. Although literature on reduction of LV mass with antihypertensive therapy is extensive, little information is available on effects of treatment on left atrial size.; Patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 109 mm Hg) were randomly allocated to treatment with atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, hydrochlorothiazide, or prazosin in a double-masked trial. Two-dimensional targeted M-mode echocardiography was used to assess left atrial size and LV mass at baseline, 8 weeks, and 1 and 2 years. Longitudinal analysis examined changes in left atrial size from the baseline study, statistically adjusting for age, race, pretreatment left atrial size and LV mass, and serial measurements of systolic blood pressure, body weight, urinary sodium excretion, and physical activity score. Without adjustment for covariates, only hydrochlorothiazide was associated with decreases in left atrial size from baseline at 8 weeks (-1.0 +/- 5.2 mm; P=0.052), 1 year (-2.0 +/- 5.1 mm; P=0.02), and 2 years (4.6+/-7.2 mm; P=0.002). After adjustment for effects of covariates, patients with normal left atrial size had greater reduction (-3.3 mm) in left atrial size at 2 years with hydrochlorothiazide than with any other drug. For patients with left atrial enlargement, left atrial size decreased significantly with hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, clonidine, and diltiazem at 1 year and with all treatments at 2 years. However, reduction at 2 years was greater with hydrochlorothiazide than with captopril or prazosin.; Antihypertensive drugs differ in their effects on left atrial size. Hydrochlorothiazide was associated with greater overall reduction of left atrial size than other drugs effective for the treatment of hypertension. Reduction of left atrial size with therapy is in part independent of factors known to influence left atrial size, including LV mass and reduction of LV mass with treatment. The clinical benefit of reducing left atrial size with antihypertensive treatment remains to be determined.",E,E

Other work in animals suggests that inhibitors of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) protect against cancer. We aimed to assess the risk of cancer in hypertensive patients receiving ACE inhibitors or other antihypertensive drugs.; Our retrospective cohort study was based on the records of 5207 patients who attended the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 1995. The patients' records are linked with the Registrar General Scotland and the West of Scotland Cancer Registry.; Compared with the West of Scotland controls, the relative risks of incident and fatal cancer among the 1559 patients receiving ACE inhibitors were 0.72 (95% CI 0.55-0.92) and 0.65 (0.44-0.93). Among the 3648 patients receiving antihypertensive drugs other than ACE inhibitors (calcium-channel blockers 1416, diuretics 2099, beta-blockers 2681), the corresponding relative risks were 110 (0.97-1.22) and 1.03 (0.87-1.20). The relative risk of cancer was lowest in women on ACE inhibitors: 0.63 (0.41-0.93) for incident cancer; 0.48 (0.23-0.88) for fatal cancer; and 0.37 (0.12-0.87) for female-specific cancers. The reduced relative risk of cancer in patients on ACE inhibitors was greatest with follow-up of longer than 3 years. Calcium-channel blockers, diuretics, and beta-blockers had no apparent effect on risk of cancer.; Long-term use of ACE inhibitors may protect against cancer. The status of this finding is more that of hypothesis generation than of hypothesis testing; randomised controlled trials are needed.",E,E

CONVINCE will compare the incidence of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular-disease-related death in two antihypertensive treatment regimens. One treatment arm begins with controlled onset-extended release (COER)-verapamil, which has its major antihypertensive effect 6-12 hours after administration. The other arm (standard of care (SOC)) begins with either hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or atenolol, one of which is preselected by the investigator for an individual patient prior to randomization. Secondary objectives include comparisons of the regimens for each of the components of the primary endpoint (separately), death or hospitalization related to cardiovascular disease, efficacy in lowering blood pressure to goal, primary events occurring between 6 am and noon, all-cause mortality, withdrawals from blinded therapy, cancer, and hospitalizations due to bleeding. Patients may be enrolled if they are hypertensive and at least 55 years of age and have an established second risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Initial medications include COER-verapamil (180 mg/d), HCTZ (12.5 mg/d), or atenolol (50 mg/d). Initial doses are doubled if blood pressure (BP) does not reach goal (systolic BP < 140 mm and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). If BP is not controlled by the higher dose of the initial medication, HCTZ is added to COER-verapamil, or the SOC choice not initially selected is added in the SOC arm. An ACE-inhibitor is recommended (although nearly any open-label medication is allowed) as the third step for patients whose BP is not adequately controlled or who have a contraindication to one of the two SOC medications. Patients take two sets of tablets daily, one in the morning and one in the evening. Although most patients switch from an established antihypertensive medication to randomized treatment, untreated patients with stages I-III hypertension (SBP between 140 and 190 or DBP between 90 and 110 mm Hg) are eligible. Outcomes are monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Enrollment began during the third quarter of 1996, and follow-up is to be completed in the third quarter of 2002.",E,E

Management includes both primary prevention of variceal bleeding and treatment of actively bleeding varices. Evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates that beta blockers and nitrates may prevent the initial episode of bleeding varices. Ample data from randomized controlled trials indicate that band ligation is more effective than scleropathy for the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices. Somatostatin may decrease rebleeding rates with or without endoscopic therapy. No effective treatment has been developed for the treatment of patients who fail endoscopic therapy.,I,8

Changes in mean flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery from normal condition to hypercapnia were evaluated by means of a transcranial Doppler in 42 hypertensive patients and 21 healthy subjects comparable for age and sex distribution. We obtained hypercapnia with breath-holding and evaluated cerebrovascular reactivity with the breath-holding index (BHI). After a baseline evaluation (time 0), patients were randomly assigned to a placebo (group 1) or atenolol (group 2) therapy. The evaluation was repeated after 30 (time 1) and 60 (time 2) days of treatment. Before treatment, hypertensive patients had significantly lower BHI values (0.96 +/- 0.1 group 1 and 0.85 +/- 0.3 group 2) than controls (1.69 +/- 0.4) (P < 0.0001). During treatment, mean blood pressure significantly decreased in group 2 patients. In the same group, BHI values significantly increased with respect to the pre-treatment evaluation: 1.39 +/- 0.2 at time 1 and 1.44 +/- 0.2 at time 2 (P < 0.0001). On the contrary, mean blood pressure and BHI values remained unchanged in the placebo group. Furthermore, BHI values were significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 patients at times 1 (P < 0.001) and 2 (P < 0.0001). These findings suggest that hypertension causes reduced capability of cerebral vessels to adapt to functional changes. This condition, which is reversible after treatment, could be implicated in the increased susceptibility to ischemic stroke in hypertension.",E,E

After administration of glycopyrrolate 0.1 mg i.v., placebo (saline) or nicardipine was administered by rapid infusion (1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 mg) or bolus injection (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg), either alone or in combination with labetalol 10 mg i.v. Unconsciousness was induced with methohexital 1 mg/kg i.v.; succinylcholine 1.2 to 1.5 mg/kg i.v. was administered for muscle relaxation. A bilateral electrical stimulus was delivered and the durations of motor and electroencephalographic (EEG) seizures were noted.; Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) values were recorded at 1- to 5-minute intervals throughout the study period. When administered as a rapid infusion, nicardipine 5 mg i.v. produced a significant decrease in MAP; however, nicardipine dosages of 10 to 15 mg i.v. did not produce a significantly greater decrease in MAP than 5 mg. Bolus administration of nicardipine 1.25 to 5 mg produced a rapid onset of its hemodynamic effects without exacerbating the cardiovascular depressant effects of methohexital. However, the decrease in MAP was accompanied by an increase in HR after administration of the 5 mg i.v. bolus dose. The acute hyperdynamic response to ECT was most effectively controlled by nicardipine 2.5 to 5 mg i.v. bolus, in combination with labetalol 10 mg i.v. Seizure duration was not significantly altered by the use of nicardipine as part of the anesthetic regimen for ECT.; Nicardipine 2.5 mg i.v. bolus in combination with labetalol 10 mg i.v. was the most effective pretreatment regimen for preventing the acute hyperdynamic response to ECT. However, this combination produced a 20% decrease in MAP immediately prior to ECT and a lower MAP at the time of discharge.",E,E

Randomized clinical trials in patients with CHD have provided convincing evidence that risk factor modification is beneficial in decreasing all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Multifactorial coronary risk reduction provides the most substantial benefit. Coronary risk reduction is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular-related hospital admissions, a reduced need for myocardial revascularization procedures, and an improved quality of life for the patients so treated.

However, early studies provided promising results in terms of improved symptoms and work capacity and reduced heart size. Small-scale studies have been completed over the past 20 years but until large-scale, long-term, randomized trials were conducted, the potential of beta-blockers in heart failure was not confirmed. The results of randomized trials published to date have included over 3,000 patients and the results show improvements in left ventricular function and heart rate. Significant improvements in New York Heart Association classification were also shown. Although no conclusive effect on mortality was shown, the first Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS) indicated a trend toward improved survival during long-term treatment with bisoprolol. Ongoing studies have been specifically designed to investigate the effects of beta-blockers on survival. One of these trials, CIBIS II, which was terminated early in 1998 because of a positive effect on survival, is expected to report in late summer 1998. Such trials will also examine the different mechanisms of action of beta-blockers in heart failure and the influence of causes on the effects of beta-blockade.",I,8

However, in some patients the introduction of therapy can be associated with a period of clinical instability, including risks of fluid retention, hypotension, and bradycardia. Appropriate patient selection and optimization of background therapy can minimize the risk during the introduction of therapy. With vigilance for early signs of clinical deterioration and appropriate adjustment of background medications, the care of most patients exhibiting clinical instability can be successfully managed so the patient is able to continue with the long-term therapy, a prerequisite to realizing beneficial effects. With the initiation of carvedilol, any evidence of fluid retention warrants a prompt increase in the diuretic dosage, and in more pronounced cases the carvedilol dose may need to be reduced or interrupted. In contrast, symptoms of hypotension (most commonly dizziness) generally resolve without intervention, although persistent problems may necessitate adjusting the timing of dose administration or perhaps temporarily reducing the dose of vasodilators or diuretics (the latter with care to avoid fluid retention). Bradycardia should be managed as standard practice would indicate. During long-term treatment, adjustments in beta-blocker dosage may be required in the event of an exacerbation of heart failure. Dosages should be adjusted as would be the case with other heart-failure medications, based on the severity of the clinical decompensation, but with care to minimize abrupt changes unless mandated by the patient's condition and to avoid precipitating ischemia or further deterioration. The occurrence of effects such as these does not necessarily indicate that a patient cannot respond favorably to long-term beta-blockade, but all require understanding, vigilance, and the availability of medical personnel, especially during the introduction of this therapy.",E,E

It is unknown if this deleterious effect is associated with changes in gastroesophageal collateral blood flow and if these can be prevented by propranolol administration. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of propranolol on the splanchnic hemodynamic response to exercise in patients with cirrhosis. Twenty-three patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension had hemodynamic measurements in baseline conditions, and during moderate cycling exercise (40 W) under double-blind propranolol or placebo administration. In patients receiving placebo, HVPG significantly increased during exercise (from 16.7 +/- 0.9 to 19.0 +/- 1.0 mm Hg; P < .01), hepatic blood flow (HBF) decreased (-18% +/- 4%; P < .01), while azygos blood flow (AzBF) was unchanged (4% +/- 12%; ns).

The lack of increase in HVPG in response to exercise in patients receiving propranolol may be related to a more pronounced decrease in HBF, as compared with patients receiving placebo, and to a blunted increase in cardiac output (CO). Moderate physical exercise adversely influences the hepatic hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis, causing a significant increase in portal pressure.

Surrogate measures of microvascular and macrovascular disease included urinary albumin excretion and retinopathy assessed by retinal photography.; Captopril and atenolol were equally effective in reducing blood pressure to a mean of 144/83 mm Hg and 143/81 mm Hg respectively, with a similar proportion of patients (27% and 31%) requiring three or more antihypertensive treatments. More patients in the captopril group than the atenolol group took the allocated treatment: at their last clinic visit, 78% of those allocated captopril and 65% of those allocated atenolol were taking the drug (P<0.0001). Captopril and atenolol were equally effective in reducing the risk of macrovascular end points. Similar proportions of patients in the two groups showed deterioration in retinopathy by two grades after nine years (31% in the captopril group and 37% in the atenolol group) and developed clinical grade albuminuria >=300 mg/l (5% and 9%). The proportion of patients with hypoglycaemic attacks was not different between groups, but mean weight gain in the atenolol group was greater (3.4 kg v 1.6 kg).; Blood pressure lowering with captopril or atenolol was similarly effective in reducing the incidence of diabetic complications. This study provided no evidence that either drug has any specific beneficial or deleterious effect, suggesting that blood pressure reduction in itself may be more important than the treatment used.",E,E

Among the 30 072 patients investigated in this post marketing retrospective study, 1813 patients (6.0 per cent) reported an adverse effect. The five most frequent side effects were coughing (3.1 per cent), dizziness (0.7 per cent), headache (0.6 per cent) asthenia (0.5 per cent) and nausea (0.3 per cent). Intolerance risk factors for trandolapril were researched using both univariate and multivariate analysis. In the univariate analysis, a prior intolerance of an ACE inhibitor and female gender were strongly correlated with either overall intolerance or coughing. The most relevant variables for the occurrence of adverse effects, listed according to their entry order in the multivariate analysis, were: prior intolerance of ACE inhibitors (OR: 4.19, 95 per cent CI: 3.66-4.78), female gender (OR: 1.46, 95 per cent CI: 1.31-1.63), prior intolerance of other antihpertensive agents (OR: 1.27, 95 per cent CI: 1.14-1.41), smoking (OR: 0.76, 95 per cent CI: 0.66-0.87) and combination with a beta blocker (OR: 1.31, 95 per cent CI: 1.08-1.58). A prior intolerance of an ACE inhibitor appears to be a very strong predictor of coughing (OR: 6.14, 95 per cent CI: 5.24-7.19). The following variables, namely female gender (OR: 1.61, 95 per cent CI: 1.40-1.85), age 60-80 (OR: 1.25, 95 per cent CI: 1.09-1.44) and prior intolerance of other antihypertensive agents (OR: 1.20, 95 per cent CI: 1.03-2.39) appear less significant.",1,E

There were no differences between the groups with respect to initial hospital costs or length of stay. Long-term follow-up at a median of 21 months revealed no significant differences in the endpoints of late revascularization, recurrent myocardial infarction, or all-cause mortality.; Early triage angiography in patients with acute coronary syndromes who are not eligible for thrombolytics reduced the composite of recurrent ischemic events or death and shortened the time to definitive revascularization during the index hospitalization.

From this combined database of 3023 patients, we evaluated the strength of evidence supporting an effect of treatment on left ventricular ejection fraction, NYHA functional class, hospitalizations for heart failure, and death. beta-Blockers exerted their most persuasive effects on ejection fraction and on the combined risk of death and hospitalization for heart failure. beta-Blockade increased the ejection fraction by 29% (P<10(-9)) and reduced the combined risk of death or hospitalization for heart failure by 37% (P<0.001). Both effects remained significant even if >90% of the trials were eliminated from the analysis or if a large number of trials with a neutral result were added to the analysis. In contrast, the effect of beta-blockade on NYHA functional class was of borderline significance (P=0.04) and disappeared with the addition or removal of only 1 moderate-size study. Although beta -blockade reduced all-cause mortality by 32% (P=0.003), this effect was only moderately robust and varied according to the type of ss-blocker tested, ie, the reduction of mortality risk was greater for nonselective beta-blockers than for beta1-selective agents (49% versus 18%, P=0.049). However, selective and nonselective beta-blockers did not differ in their effects on other measures of clinical efficacy.; These analyses indicate that there is persuasive evidence supporting a favorable effect of beta-blockade on ejection fraction and the combined risk of death and hospitalization for heart failure. In contrast, the effect of these drugs on other end points requires additional study.",I,8

Their method amounts to discretizing a preselected continuous boundary by clumping the density of the boundary crossing time at discrete analysis times and calculating the resultant discrete-time boundary values. In this framework, the cumulative distribution function of the continuous-time stopping rule is used as an alpha spending function. A key assumption that underlies this method is that future analysis times are not chosen on the basis of the current value of the statistic. However, clinical trials may be monitored more frequently when they are close to crossing the boundary. In this situation, the corresponding continuous-time boundary should be used. Here we demonstrate how to construct a continuous stopping boundary from an alpha spending function. This capability is useful in the design of clinical trials.

In this study, a specific bradykinin-receptor antagonist, icatibant acetate (HOE 140), was used to determine the contribution of bradykinin to the short-term effects of ACE inhibition on blood pressure and plasma renin activity in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects.; We compared the hemodynamic, renal, and endocrine effects of captopril alone (25 mg), captopril plus icatibant (100 microg per kilogram of body weight), the angiotensin II subtype 1-receptor antagonist losartan (75 mg), and placebo in 20 subjects with normal blood pressure and 7 subjects with hypertension. The subjects were studied while they were salt depleted (i.e., in balance on a diet in which they were allowed 10 mmol of sodium per day). The drugs were administered on four separate study days in a single-blind, randomized fashion.; The coadministration of icatibant significantly attenuated the hypotensive effect of captopril (maximal decrease in mean arterial pressure for all subjects combined, 10.5+/-1.0 mm Hg, as compared with 14.0+/-1.0 mm Hg for captopril alone; P=0.001), in such a way that the decrease in blood pressure after the administration of captopril plus icatibant was similar to that after the administration of losartan (maximal decrease in mean arterial pressure, 11.0+/-1.7 mm Hg). Icatibant did not alter the renal hemodynamic response to captopril, but it significantly altered the change in plasma renin activity in response to ACE inhibition (-0.4+/-0.4 ng of angiotensin I per milliliter per hour, as compared with 2.0+/-0.7 ng per milliliter per hour for captopril alone; P=0.007). The magnitude of these effects was similar in both the normotensive and the hypertensive subjects, as well as in both the black subjects and the white subjects.; These data confirm that bradykinin contributes to the short-term effects of ACE inhibition on blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive persons and suggest that bradykinin also contributes to the short-term effects of ACE inhibition on the renin-angiotensin system.",E,E

While the intervention study is progressing, this article summarizes baseline data obtained from the whole cohort of 2259 patients randomly allocated to treatment.; Baseline ultrasound data were obtained from two replicate examinations performed shortly before random allocation to treatment by certified sonographers at 23 referral centres and read at the ultrasound coordinating centre at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Intima-media thickness was measured at up to 12 different sites in the carotid artery tree and expressed as the mean of the maxima at these sites (Mmax), the mean of the maxima at four sites in the distal common carotid artery and bifurcation (CBMmax) and the maximum intima-media thickness (Tmax). Baseline demographic and clinical measurements were performed by investigators in 410 peripheral clinical units and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitorings read and validated by members of a centralized unit at the University of Milan. The statistical analysis centre at the Technische Universit盲t M眉nchen received and analysed all baseline data, by calculating means +/- SD, medians and ranges and performing correlation (Spearman correlation coefficients) and multiple regression analyses.; Prevalence of carotid artery wall alterations among the hypertensive patients randomly allocated to treatment in the ELSA was very high: 82% had Tmax > or = 1.3 mm ('plaques' according to protocol) and 17% had Tmax > or = 1.0 and < 1.3 mm ('thickening'), with a median of two plaques per patient. We found significant correlations between ultrasound measurements and the following demographic and clinical variables: age, sex, systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure (both clinic and ambulatory), concentrations of total, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, smoking habit and duration of hypertension. We found no significant correlation to diastolic blood pressure and glucose concentration. A multiple regression analysis indicated significant variables in the following rank order: age, 24 h ambulatory pulse pressure, sex, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, triglyceride concentration, smoking and clinic systolic blood pressure.; Analysis of baseline data from the ELSA has shown that there is an extremely marked prevalence of carotid artery wall alterations among mild-to-moderate, middle-aged hypertensive patients. In addition to age, systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, particularly if they are accurately measured by ambulatory monitoring, play a major role, somewhat greater than those of sex, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and smoking, in influencing intima-media thickness.",E,E

The percentage of patients who complained of sexual dysfunction symptoms was significantly higher in the atenolol- than in the lisinopril-treated group (17% v 3%, P < .05).

Antihypertensive drug therapy may be initiated either after a trial of lifestyle modifications or immediately after the diagnosis is made, depending on the patient's other cardiovascular risk factors and the presence of clinical cardiovascular disease. In general, therapy may begin with diuretics or beta-adrenergic blockers in patients under age 65, unless a concomitant condition warrants another, more tailored choice. Low dosages should be used initially, but if the blood pressure is not successfully reduced to 140/90 mm Hg or below, another drug should be added or should replace the initial choice. General principles of therapy include the use of once-a-day formulations and combination drugs as well as cost considerations.",E,E

Because reversal of LVH may be associated with an improvement of prognosis, the influence of new antihypertensive compounds, such as angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonists, on LVH should be determined.; In a randomized, double-blind trial, 69 predominantly previously untreated hypertensive patients with echocardiographically proven LVH, ie, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) >134 g/m2 in men and >110 g/m2 in women and/or end-diastolic septal thickness >12 mm, received either the angiotensin II antagonist valsartan or atenolol for 8 months. Echocardiographic data of 58 patients were available. After 8 months of valsartan treatment (n=29), LVMI decreased from 127+/-23 to 106+/-25 g/m2 (ratio [R]=0.83; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.87; P<0.0001 versus baseline). Under atenolol (n=29), LVMI decreased to a smaller extent, from 127+/-25 to 117+/-27 g/m2 (R=0.92; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.98; P=0.0082 versus baseline). The mean reduction of LVMI came to 21 g/m2 under valsartan and only to 10 g/m2 under atenolol (R=0.91; 90% CI, 0.85 to 0.97 versus atenolol). Baseline mean blood pressure values were determined to be 163+/-12/101+/-6 mm Hg before treatment with valsartan and 160+/-14/103+/-6 mm Hg before atenolol treatment. After 8 months of treatment, mean blood pressure decreased to 146+/-13/90+/-7 mm Hg with valsartan and to 147+/-18/90+/-7 mm Hg with atenolol. Nine patients in the valsartan group and 8 patients in the atenolol group required additional medication with hydrochlorothiazide.; Antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin II antagonist valsartan for 8 months produced a significant regression of LVH in predominantly previously untreated patients with essential hypertension. The drug may be safely administered in this subset of hypertensive patients; however, the long-term benefit in terms of risk reduction has still to be evaluated in further trials.",E,E

This article reviews results from recent trials suggesting that the etiology of HF, and particularly whether it is ischemic or nonischemic, may influence the long-term prognosis and the response to treatment. Some studies, but not all, suggest that nonischemic HF has a better prognosis than ischemic HF. The data on the benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in ischemic versus nonischemic HF are conflicting. Carvedilol, and recently, bisoprolol have been shown to reduce mortality in ischemic and nonischemic HF, whereas metoprolol has, to date, improved prognosis only in dilated cardiomyopathy. Better responses to digoxin, amlodipine and amiodarone have been reported in non-ischemic HF. There is at present no clear explanation for the apparent therapeutic differences between ischemic and nonischemic HF. Absence of a rigorous definition of ""nonischemic HF"" in many studies makes interpretation of the results difficult. Further studies to clarify the effects of etiology of HF on the response to treatment could be particularly important for preventing progression to more advanced stages, in which any type of drug therapy may have limited value in prolonging survival. An individualized therapeutic approach, based on etiology of HF and possibly other factors such as plasma drug levels or the levels of neurohormones, could result in major progress in treating HF patients.",I,8

For this reason, recent attention has focused on calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. While these agents reduce blood pressure, outcome data from large randomized trials are lacking, but some case-control data, dominated by short-acting dihydropyridines, suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular events. These studies had methodologic limitations and did not differentiate among calcium antagonist types and formulations. Several studies differentiating among calcium antagonist types and an overview of published randomized trials show no increased risk with verapamil and suggestion for benefit in CAD patients.; A total of 27,000 CAD patients with hypertension will be randomized at 1,500 primary care sites to receive either a calcium antagonist-based (verapamil) or beta-blocker/diuretic-based (atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide) antihypertensive care strategy. The study uses a novel, electronic ""paper-less"" system for direct on-screen data entry, randomization and drug distribution from a mail pharmacy linked to the coordination center via the Internet.; Contract negotiations with the United States and international sites are ongoing. Patients being enrolled are predominantly elderly (72% aged 60 years or older) men (54%), with either an abnormal coronary angiogram or prior MI (71%). In addition to hypertension, CAD and elderly age, most patients (89%) have one or more associated conditions (diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, cerebral or peripheral vascular disease, etc.) contributing to increased risk for adverse outcome. While 26% have diabetes, most of these are noninsulin dependent. Using the protocol strategies, target blood pressures (according to JNC VI) have been reached in 58% at the fourth visit, and as expected most (89%) are requiring multiple antihypertensive drugs.; The design and baseline characteristics of the initial patients recruited for a prospective, randomized, international, multicenter study comparing two therapeutic strategies to control hypertension in CAD patients are described.",E,E

Of these respondents, 40% (1041) of the hypertensive men and 59% (1403) of the hypertensive women were being treated pharmacologically; 57% (595) of the treated men and 54% (760) of the treated women were on monotherapy for hypertension with a diuretic (men 14.8%, women 37.2%), a beta-blocker (men 59.0%, women 45.3%), a calcium antagonist (men 8.6%, women 5.0%) or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (men 17.7%, women 12.5%). Among those on monotherapy for hypertension, women were less likely than men to be using a beta-blocker [prevalence odds ratio (POR), female/male=0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24-0.47], a calcium antagonist (POR=0.27, 95% CI 0.15-0.48) or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (POR=0.34, 95% CI 0.22-0.52) than a diuretic. These sex differences persisted after adjustment for all factors that could have influenced the choice of these antihypertensive drugs (indications and contra-indications for the four antihypertensive drug classes). The sex differences in antihypertensive drug use were smaller among hypertensives with a history of cardiovascular disease (adjusted PORs, female/male, for beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors, respectively, compared to diuretics were 0.80 with 95% CI 0.20-3.24, 0.40 with 95% CI 0.10-0.48 and 0.64 with 95% CI 0.12-3.39) than among those without such a history.; The different patterns of antihypertensive drug use among hypertensive men and women seem irrational, and cannot be explained by factors known to influence antihypertensive drug choice. Among hypertensives with a history of cardiovascular disease, the sex differences were smaller than among those without such a history. Further research is required to explain the sex differences in the choice of antihypertensive drug by prescribers, and to investigate the consequences of these differences for long-term patient outcomes.",E,E

After a 4-week placebo run-in phase, 116 obese, postmenopausal women with primary hypertension were randomised into two treatment groups receiving once daily dosages of either moexipril 7.5 mg or atenolol 25 mg initially (mean age: 57 +/- 7 years in both groups; mean weight: 94 kg in the moexipril group and 89 kg in the atenolol group, corresponding to a body mass index (BMI) of 35.2 kg/m2 and 34.1 kg/m2 in both groups, respectively). After 4 and 8 weeks, the dosages were uptitrated to moexipril 15 mg, or if necessary to moexipril 15 mg/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg, or to atenolol 50 mg and atenolol 50 mg/HCTZ 25 mg, in patients whose blood pressure was not sufficiently controlled. At endpoint, metabolic parameters (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, glucose, insulin) were not significantly altered in either treatment group. Most frequent adverse events under monotherapy (moexipril/atenolol) were asthenia (5.3/13.0%), headache (13.2/21.7%), cough (7.9/6.5%), pharyngitis (21.1/8.7%) and peripheral oedema (5.3/13.0%). Overall at least one AE was reported in 66% of the patients treated with moexipril and in 78% of those treated with atenolol.

In 1989-1996 2308 diabetics had spa treatment in the Military Balneological Institute in Karlovy Vary and 1058 of these patients had hypertension (45.8%). The patients were from all parts of the Czech Republic and before 1993 from the whole Czechoslovak Federal Republic. The authors investigated the pharmacotherapy of hypertension and focused attention on four basic groups of antihypertensive drugs (beta-blockers, diuretics, Ca channel blockers and ACE inhibitors). They recorded a marked drop of the number of patients taking diuretics (from 62% to 24%), and a slight decline in the group taking beta-blockers). They recorded an increase in Ca channel blockers (from 7% to 54%) and in recent years of ACE inhibitors (from practically zero to 24%). They draw attention to the dominant ratio of some drugs in selected groups of antihypertensives and discuss whether they are suitable for the treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus.

In ST elevation myocardial infarction, new aggressive thrombolytic regimens improve early reperfusion and improve survival. The current focus is on bolus thrombolysis, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition, and low-molecular-weight heparin as adjuncts. In unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, two major advances are IIb/IIIa inhibition and low-molecular-weight heparin, each of which significantly improves the outcome of patients and which have just been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration. Following acute coronary syndromes, cholesterol lowering with statin drugs has a major effect, even in the large group of patients with average cholesterol levels. Use of clopidogrel, a more potent antiplatelet agent than aspirin, appears to decrease recurrent ischemic events, which has highlighted the potential benefits of oral IIb/IIIa inhibitors, which are much more potent antiplatelet agents. An additional focus has been on ensuring that patients actually receive the currently available medications.

This change could be facilitated by computerization similar to the interpretation programs available for the resting ECG. Therefore, we sought to determine if computerization of both exercise ECG measurements and prediction equations can substitute for visual analysis performed by cardiologists to predict which patients have severe angiographic coronary artery disease. We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients referred for evaluation of possible or known coronary artery disease who underwent both exercise testing with digital recording of their exercise ECGs and coronary angiography at two university-affiliated Veteran's Affairs medical centers and a Hungarian hospital. There were 2,385 consecutive male patients with complete data who had exercise tests between 1987 and 1997. Measurements included clinical and exercise test data, and visual interpretation of the ECG paper tracings and > 100 computed measurements from the digitized ECG recordings and compilation of angiographic data from clinical reports. The computer measurements had similar diagnostic power compared with visual interpretation. Computerized ECG measurements from maximal exercise or recovery were equivalent or superior to all other measurements. Prediction equations applied by computer were only able to correctly classify two or three more patients out of 100 tested than ECG measurements alone. beta-Blockers had no effect on test characteristics while ST depression on the resting ECG decreased specificity. By setting probability limits using the scores from the equations, the population was divided into high-, intermediate-, and low-probability groups. A strategy using further testing in the intermediate group resulted in 86% sensitivity and 85% specificity for identifying patients with severe coronary disease. We conclude that computerized exercise ST measurements are comparable to visual ST measurements by a cardiologist and computerized scores only minimally improved the discriminatory power of the test. However, using these scores in a stratification algorithm allows the nonspecialist physician to improve the discriminatory characteristics of the standard exercise test even when resting ST depression is present. Computerization permitted accurate identification of patients with severe coronary disease who require referral.",E,E

Eighty-six were treated with beta blockers, 64 with diuretics, 133 with calcium antagonists and 56 with ACE inhibitors. Blood pressure dropped similarly with all medications. During follow up, 79 patients died. Life table analysis showed that patients with a history of angina, diabetes or myocardial infarction had higher mortality rates. Similarly, patients treated with beta blockers and diuretics had higher mortality than patients treated with calcium antagonists or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.

9833172,Nephroprotection by antihypertensive therapy.,Antihypertensive Agents; Blood Pressure; Humans; Hypertension; Kidney,"Jacobi, J; Schmieder, R E","Morbidity and mortality due to end-stage renal failure has become a major health concern in recent years and there is clear evidence that arterial hypertension constitutes a powerful risk factor for the progression of renal disease. Several studies have documented the benefit of blood pressure control on renal function, and it is increasingly recognized that antihypertensive therapy aimed at reducing blood pressure well below the target value of 140/90 mmHg further improves the overall renal survival rate. Different classes of antihypertensive agents show disparate specific nephroprotective properties that are unrelated to their blood pressure lowering properties. ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers have been reported to ameliorate renal function by favorably modifying renal and intraglomerular hemodynamics. In addition, both drugs exert beneficial effects on non-hemodynamic parameters of renal function. In contrast, beta-blockers and diuretics, although still being solely recommended as first line drugs in the management of arterial hypertension, can have adverse effects on renal function. Recently, long-term randomized controlled trials have consistently demonstrated the superior nephroprotective value of ACE inhibitors on renal function outcome. Whether AT1 receptor antagonists have similar effects on long-term renal survival is still under investigation. The outcome of forthcoming clinical trials is likely to influence clinical guidelines and optimize the medical regimen of human essential hypertension in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.",E,E

Beta-receptor blocker therapy has been effective in improving clinical status and left ventricular function in patients with heart failure. Similarly, high doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with nitrates partially reverse the ventricular remodeling of heart failure.; We tested the hypothesis that beta-blocker therapy added to high-dose ACE inhibitor-nitrates would potentiate the reversal of heart failure.; Thirteen patients, aged 52 +/- 8 years, with moderate to severe heart failure, 12 of whom were referred for transplant consideration, with heart failure duration of 4.8 +/- 2.2 years, were prospectively followed for 12 months. Baseline echocardiographic ejection fraction was 19 +/- 8%, and presenting New York Heart Association class was 2.9 +/- 0.7. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nitrates were uptitrated over 6 months to a final dose of lisinopril 53 +/- 31 mg/day, and isosorbide dinitrate 217 +/- 213 mg/day. At 6 months, beta-blocker therapy with atenolol was initiated and titrated to a final dose of 46 +/- 23 mg/day. Two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography and metabolic stress testing were performed at baseline, at 6 months on lisinopril-nitrates only, and at 12 months on combined ACE inhibitor-nitrate and beta-blocker therapy.; New York Heart Association classification improved from 2.9 +/- 0.7 to 1.8 +/- 0.8 on lisinopril-nitrates (p < 0.05), and to 1.5 +/- 0.5 with the addition of beta blockade (p = NS). On follow-up, peak oxygen consumption rose from 17 +/- 7 ml O2/kg/min at baseline to 21 +/- 5 ml O2/kg/min at 6 months on lisinopril-nitrates (p = 0.06) without further change on beta blockade.

The addition of beta-receptor blockade over and above high-dose ACE inhibitor-nitrates was well tolerated but had no further impact on symptomatic status, exercise tolerance, or left ventricular systolic function. The potential for pharmacologic reversal of heart failure remodeling may be finite despite the use of complementary therapies. Larger placebo-controlled and randomized trials of beta-receptor blockade added to high-dose ACE inhibitor-nitrate therapy are needed to confirm these observations.",E,E

At 4 weeks, the effects on heart rate, blood pressure and lipids appeared similar and subjects taking a beta-blocker were combined. Compared with placebo, those on a beta-blocker gained 0.5 kg in weight (P = 0.04), heart rate fell from 63 to 52 beats/min (P < 0.0001) and blood pressure fell from 116/74 to 113/69 mmHg (P < 0.005); high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol fell from 1.26 to 1.11 mmol/l (P = 0.005), there being no change in the ratio of free to esterified cholesterol in HDL, and there was an apparent rise in serum triacylglycerols from 1.18 to 1.43 mmol/l (P = 0.15 when adjusted for weight gain). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and lipoprotein (a) did not change. In this study, the oxidizability of LDL was unaffected by beta-blocker therapy. beta-blockade was not associated with any change in LDL fatty acid profile, or beta-carotene or alpha-tocopherol content which might account for the reduced LDL oxidizability previously reported in patients treated with beta-blockers. Furthermore, neither atenolol nor propranolol, at concentrations up to 100 mumol/l, had any effect on in vitro oxidizability of LDL obtained from healthy volunteers. 3. In contrast to the favourable haemodynamic effects conferred by beta-blockers, the effects on weight and serum triacylglycerols and HDL-cholesterol appear to be adverse and we did not demonstrate any changes in lipid oxidizability which might be relevant to the protective effects of beta-blockers in patients with coronary disease.",E,E

Altogether, 9223 patients in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the United States were randomized from June 1995 through April 1997, and 9194 remain after exclusion of a study center at which irregularities were discovered. This population of hypertensives (mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure, 174.4/97.8 mm Hg) with LVH comprises women (54.1%) and men, mostly retired from active work (mean age, 66.9 years), with a high prevalence of overweight (mean body mass index, 28.0 kg/m2), diabetes mellitus (12.3%), lipid disorders (18.0%), and symptoms or signs of coronary heart disease (15.1%). There were fewer current smokers (<17%) than in the general population, and approximately 7% were nonwhite. Almost 30% of participants had been untreated for at least 6 months when screened for the study.

Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) is central to treating HF patients, because these agents decrease mortality and morbidity significantly. Digoxin does not reduce mortality but does reduce morbidity. Angiotensin II antagonists, although found to provide clinical benefit equal to ACE-I, have not been found as yet to have similar effects on mortality and morbidity. Diuretics and nitrates are useful for treating these patients' symptoms.

This report presents the clinical follow-up of these patients at a mean, after randomization, of 2.4 years for interview and 3.0 years for exercise testing. Of the 212 patients originally randomized, 175 received an extended follow-up interview, and 132 underwent exercise testing; 62% of patients in the PTCA group were angina free compared with 47% of patients in the medical group (p <0.05).

This was an epidemiologic, prospective survey involving 2152 patients recruited in November 1995 from 312 French coronary care units.; All consecutive patients admitted within 48 hours for confirmed acute myocardial infarction to the participating centers in November 1995 were included. For each patient, baseline parameters, as well as clinical course and therapeutic treatment during the first 5 days, were collected. For the purpose of this study, the diagnosis of heart failure required a left ventricular ejection fraction </=35% and/or a Killip class >1. During the 1-year follow-up, date and cause of death were recorded. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed with the log rank test. Cox multivariate analyses were used to assess the independent prognostic factors among 5-day survivors. Eight hundred twenty-one (38%) patients exhibited heart failure during the first 5 days after myocardial infarction. Patients with heart failure were 10 years older and were more likely to be hypertensive or diabetic; use of primary revascularization (33% vs 47%, P <.001) and beta-blockers (40% vs 79%, P <.001) was less frequent, whereas prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was enhanced (56% vs 41%, P <.001). Mortality rate was strongly related to both left ventricular ejection fraction (P <. 001) and Killip class (P <.001). One-year mortality rate was 39.7% in patients with heart failure compared with 7.1% in patients without heart failure (P <.001).

It was more pronounced in patients with heart failure.; Results of this French observational survey are in line with previous epidemiologic studies and with major therapeutic trials. Patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction constitute a high-risk group. They appear to derive a greater benefit from treatment with both beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors than from each class on its own.",E,E

To determine the success of single and combination therapy in achieving target blood pressures in such a population.; INSIGHT is a double-blind, prospective outcome trial comparing the efficacy of the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine GITS, and the thiazide, co-amilozide, in preventing myocardial infarction and stroke. We recruited 2996 men and 3454 women, aged 55-80 years, with blood pressure during placebo run-in >150/95 mmHg or isolated systolic blood pressure >160 mmHg from nine countries. Treatment allocation to nifedipine GITS 30 mg daily or co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/amiloride 5 mg) once daily was performed by minimization rather than randomization to balance additional risk factors. This was followed by four optional increases in treatment: dose-doubling of the primary drug, addition of atenolol 25/50 mg or enalapril 5/10 mg, and then any other hypotensive drug excluding calcium blockers or diuretics. Target blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg or a fall > or = 20/10 mmHg.; Blood pressure at randomization was 172+/-15 / 99+/-9 mmHg. Thirteen per cent of the patients were previously untreated. The proportions of each additional risk factors were: smoking > 10/day, 29%; cholesterol > 6.43 mmol/l, 52%; family history of premature myocardial infarction or stroke, 21%; diabetes mellitus 20%; left ventricular hypertrophy, 10%; previous myocardial infarction, other presentations of coronary heart disease, and peripheral vascular disease, each 6%; proteinuria, 3%. Fifty-five per cent of patients had one additional risk factor, whereas 33%, 9% and 3% had two, three or more additional risk factors, respectively. The blood pressure (and falls in blood pressure) at the end of titration and at 1 year after minimization was 139+/-12 / 82+/-7 mmHg (33+/-15 / 17+/-9) in the 5226 patients still on randomized treatment The numbers requiring the four treatment increments were, respectively, 1591, 780, 597 and 294, meaning that almost 70% of patients on randomized treatment in INSIGHT are receiving only the primary drug. At one year, 69% of patients had a blood pressure < or = 140/90 mmHg.; INSIGHT is one of the first double-blind comparisons of active antihypertensive treatments, requiring high-risk patients to achieve sufficient power. Despite this requirement, it is possible to achieve good blood pressure control in most patients without the addition of multiple additional treatments that may dilute any differences between the primary agents.",E,E

Nevertheless, the mechanisms leading to cardiac injury and irreversible cellular changes remain elusive. Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) are the critical mediators of cellular damage during ischemia-reperfusion. To explore the response of cardiac oxidative stress parameters to intravenous (i.v.) And intraperitoneal (i.p.) cocaine exposure, cardiac total glutathione (GSH, GSSG), malonaldialdehyde (MDA), Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), catalase (CAT), GSH-peroxidase (GSH-px), and GSH s-transferase (GST) were measured, along with biochemical and histologic markers indicative of cardiac injury. Repeated i.p. cocaine exposure produced significant impairment in cardiac integrity, demonstrated by increased circulating lactate (2.4-fold; p < 0.0001), creatine kinase (2.2-fold; p < 0.0001), and creatinine levels (1.7-fold; p < 0.0001). Infiltration of neutrophils into myocardial cavities also was evident. These changes paralleled increases in cardiac MDA (25%; p < 0.04), GSSG (55%; p < 0.001), protein carbonyls (23%; p < 0.05), and Mn-SOD (23%; p < 0.05) levels, indicative of oxidative stress, decreases in GSH (35%; p < 0.01), adenosine triphosphate (ATP; 26%; p < 0.04), GSH-px (28%; p < 0.03), CAT (32%; p < 0.01), and GST (50%; p < 0.001) levels. Intravenous cocaine administration also had similar effects on cardiac oxidative stress measures. In conclusion, our data indicate that cocaine administration compromised the heart's antioxidant defense system.",I,8

This was tested by analyzing data from patients who had taken part in the Circadian Anti-ischemia Program in Europe (CAPE) trial. After a 2-week, single-blind, run-in period (Phase 1), patients were randomized to amlodipine, 5 mg/day (first 4 weeks) and 10 mg/day (second 4 weeks), or placebo for 8 weeks (Phase 2). The 48-h Holter data were analyzed for 167 amlodipine-treated patients and 83 placebo patients based on a 2:1 randomization scheme. Sixty-three per cent of amlodipine patients and 67% of placebo patients were receiving concomitant BBLs, and >90% had taken sublingual nitrates during anginal attacks, as basic antiischemic therapy. After 7 weeks of therapy, when 48-h Holter monitoring was repeated, there were no significant changes in the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias in the placebo or amlodipine groups for all patients or subgroups of patients with or without BBLs. Also, between-group comparisons showed no significant differences in arrhythmias between amlodipine and placebo patients. In summary, amlodipine (5-10 mg/day) given to patients with severe, chronic CAD receiving conventional antiischemic therapy, did not produce any proarrhythmic effects.",E,E

We sought to determine first whether beta-adrenoreceptor blockade will improve baroreceptor function and vagal tone in chronic heart failure, and second whether there were any differences between standard therapy with metoprolol and the second-generation vasodilating beta-blocker celiprolol. In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study 50 patients with stable chronic heart failure received either celiprolol 200 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks after a 4-week dose titration period. Thirty-five healthy normal subjects were also studied. Baroreceptor gain was assessed non-invasively by cross-spectral analysis of R-R and systolic blood pressure low- and high-frequency components (the alpha angle) during controlled respiration. High-frequency power was used as a measure of vagal modulation. Satisfactory recordings for analysis were obtained in 31 patients with heart failure. The results showed that at baseline baroreceptor gain (alphaHF) was significantly depressed in patients with heart failure compared with the normal control group (4.95+/-0. 55 versus 11.73+/-1.32 ms/mmHg, P<0.0001). After 12 weeks of treatment with metoprolol baroreceptor gain improved significantly whether measured while supine (P=0.03) or standing (P=0.009), and this was associated with a significant increase in R-R HF power (P=0. 008). There were no significant changes after treatment with celiprolol or placebo. We conclude that metoprolol but not celiprolol therapy restores baroreceptor gain towards normal and increases vagal tone in chronic heart failure. The ancillary properties of celiprolol do not appear to provide any advantages over metoprolol for the restoration of autonomic and baroreceptor function in heart failure.",E,E

After the open-label carvedilol run-in, patients received carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) or placebo for an average of 19 months. The main adverse events during this double-blind period were worsened heart failure, hypotension/dizziness, bradycardia/atrioventricular block, and aggravation of angina. By Chi square analysis, carvedilol and amiodarone together were not associated with a greater overall incidence of adverse effects than either drug alone. The beneficial effects of carvedilol on left ventricular ejection that were observed in the main trial were preserved in the presence of amiodarone.; Carvedilol is a useful additional therapy for patients with chronic heart failure already receiving amiodarone. Carvedilol can be added to amiodarone in these patients without expectation of increased adverse effects or loss of clinical efficacy.",E,E

However, the benefits of ACE inhibition are not homogeneous and are largely confined to high-risk patients who have subjective or objective evidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. How long treatment should continue is a vexed question, which also arises with other agents, for example beta-blocker use after MI. The AIREX study assessed the long-term magnitude and duration of the survival benefits observed with ramipril in patients after MI who have clinically defined heart failure. The mortality status of all 603 patients recruited from the UK centres involved in the AIRE study was verified at an extended 5-year follow-up (3 years after the AIRE study closed). Ramipril assignation was associated with a 36% relative and a 11% absolute mortality risk reduction. These findings strongly support the view to select patients on the basis of impaired LV function and reinforce the previously reported conclusions of the ""selective"" ACE inhibition post-MI trials. Using this approach, the survival benefit is not only of large magnitude but also sustained over many years. These results also argue for life-long treatment with an ACE inhibitor, once a decision to treat an individual patient after MI has been made.",E,E

If blood pressure (BP) remained suboptimally controlled after 4 weeks (supine diastolic BP >90 mm Hg 24-h post dose), the dose was doubled for a further 4 weeks. After 8 weeks felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine BP significantly more than enalapril (19.7/12.0 mmHg and 11.1/7.2 mm Hg, respectively). The mean differences in change in BP between treatments were 8.6/4.8 mm Hg in favour of felodipine-metoprolol (P = 0.001/P <0.001). A statistically significant difference to the advantage of felodipine-metoprolol was also seen in standing BP. Even though the dose was increased in a larger proportion of patients in the enalapril group (61%) than in the felodipine-metoprolol group (40%), fewer enalapril-treated patients achieved adequate BP control (41% vs 63% on felodipine-metoprolol, P <0.05). Both treatments were well tolerated. Three patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol and four with enalapril discontinued treatment due to adverse events. A similar number of patients reported adverse events in each treatment group. In conclusion, a combination tablet of felodipine-metoprolol 5/50-10/100 mg once daily reduced BP more effectively than enalapril 10-20 mg once daily 24 h post dose. The result was expected, but a more important observation was that both treatments were tolerated to a similar degree. Obviously, a considerable BP reduction may be well tolerated, as was the main purpose to demonstrate in this study.",E,E

A MEDLARS search of published articles from 1966 to 1995 in English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish, supplemented by a manual search of bibliographies, identified 60 randomized controlled trials that met protocol criteria. Blinded articles were extracted by 2 physicians. The pooled risks of death, withdrawal, and cardiovascular event were computed and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) for all nifedipine formulations and relative to same study control drug regimens. Thirty cardiovascular events were reported in 2635 nifedipine exposures (1.14%) and 19 events in 2655 other active drug exposures (0.72%). Unadjusted ORs for nifedipine versus controls were 1.40 (95% CI, 0.56 to 3.49) for major events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedure), 1.75 (95% CI, 0.83 to 3.67) for increased angina, and 1.61 (95% CI, 0.91 to 2.87) for all events (major events plus increased angina).

The OR for immediate-release nifedipine was significantly higher than that for sustained-release/extended-release nifedipine (P=0.001), and the OR for nifedipine monotherapy was higher than that for nifedipine combination therapy (P=0.03). Increased risks of cardiovascular events in patients with stable angina on nifedipine were due primarily to more episodes of increased angina, confined to the immediate-release formulation and to nifedipine monotherapy.",E,E

Clinical trial results, however, may not reflect conditions in actual practice. In hypertension, for example, trials indicate equivalent antihypertensive efficacy and safety for many medications, yet blood pressure frequently remains uncontrolled, perhaps owing to poor compliance. This paper examines the effect of initial choice of treatment on persistence with therapy in actual practice.; The authors examined all outpatient prescriptions for antihypertensive medications filled in Saskatchewan between 1989 and 1994 by over 22,000 patients with newly diagnosed hypertension whose initial treatment was with a diuretic, beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker or angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Rates of persistence over the first year of treatment were compared.; After 6 months, persistence with therapy was poor and differed according to the class of initial therapeutic agent: 80% for diuretics, 85% for beta-blockers, 86% for calcium-channel blockers and 89% for ACE inhibitors (p < 0.001). These differences remained significant when age, sex and health status in the previous year were controlled for. Changes in the therapeutic regimen were also associated with lack of persistence.; A relation not seen in clinical trials--between persistence with treatment and initial antihypertensive medication prescribed--was found in actual practice. This relation also indicates the importance of real-world studies for evidence-based medicine.",E,E

These models were modified as clinical evidence supported or refuted their assumptions. During the past 2 decades, heart failure models emphasized the importance of neurohormonal systems in heart failure progression. The positive impact that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have had on mortality from heart failure has bolstered the neurohormonal theory. Attention recently has turned to the sympathetic nervous system and its potential deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system in heart failure. The sympathetic nervous system can negatively impact the cardiovascular system in heart failure in several ways, including down-regulating beta1-receptors, exerting direct toxic effects on the myocardium, and contributing to myocardial remodeling and life-threatening arrhythmias. Beta-adrenergic blockers have shown promise for reducing morbidity and mortality in heart failure, but definitive reductions in mortality remain to be shown by future investigations.",I,8
