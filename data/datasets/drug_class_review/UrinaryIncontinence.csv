10073329,Pharmacokinetics of an oral once-a-day controlled-release oxybutynin formulation compared with immediate-release oxybutynin.,"Administration, Oral; Aged; Area Under Curve; Cholinergic Antagonists; Circadian Rhythm; Cross-Over Studies; Delayed-Action Preparations; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Humans; Mandelic Acids; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Middle Aged; Urinary Incontinence; Xerostomia","Gupta, S K; Sathyan, G","Oxybutynin is used for the treatment of urge urinary incontinence. In this randomized, open-label, two-way crossover, multiple-dose study, the pharmacokinetics of a once-daily, controlled-release formulation, OROS oxybutynin chloride, was compared with that of immediate-release (IR) oxybutynin (Ditropan). Thirteen healthy female volunteers received three 5 mg OROS oxybutynin chloride tablets once daily for 4 days or IR oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 4 days. On day 1, with OROS oxybutynin chloride, mean plasma concentrations rose slowly over approximately 6 hours following dosing (mean Cmax 4.2 ng/mL) and remained fairly constant over the 24-hour dosing interval, whereas with IR oxybutynin, mean plasma concentrations rose rapidly within the first hour after dosing (mean Cmax 12.0 ng/mL), then declined. The mean oxybutynin degree of fluctuation was much lower for OROS oxybutynin chloride (78%) than for IR oxybutynin (371%). For both formulations, the plasma concentration-time profiles for the metabolite N-desethyloxybutynin paralleled those of oxybutynin but at higher concentrations. Steady-state oxybutynin concentrations were achieved by day 3 for both formulations. Mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values for both oxybutynin and its metabolite were similar between day 1 and day 4 for each treatment, suggesting time-invariant pharmacokinetics. With OROS oxybutynin chloride, mean relative bioavailability was higher (153%) for oxybutynin and lower (69%) for N-desethyloxybutynin compared with IR oxybutynin. This increased bioavailability may be due to reduced first-pass metabolism; within 3 to 5 hours after dosing, OROS systems are thought to reach the colon, where cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation (oxybutynin's primary metabolic pathway) may be less extensive than in the small intestine. Fewer subjects reported any adverse event with OROS oxybutynin chloride than with IR oxybutynin (including dry mouth, oxybutynin's most frequently reported anticholinergic adverse effect).",I,8

Where possible, the properties of the new drugs are compared with those of older drugs marketed for the same indications.; A number of the new therapeutic agents marketed in 1998 have important advantages over older medications. An understanding of the properties of these agents is important for the pharmacist to effectively counsel patients about their use and to serve as a valuable source of information for other health professionals regarding these drugs.",E,E
10160084,A review of the quality-of-life aspects of urinary urge incontinence.,Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Urinary Incontinence,"Lenderking, W R; Nackley, J F; Anderson, R B; Testa, M A","Urinary incontinence (UI) is prevalent and costly, occurring in 15 to 30% of the US population over the age of 60 years. Among people aged 15 to 64 years, UI occurs in 1.5 to 5% of men and 10 to 25% of women. Severe incontinence occurs in 6% of the general US population, and it is estimated that $US10 billion per year is spent in direct costs alone on care for these patients. This review presents a description of the various types of UI and describes the prevalence and costs of the condition. In addition, 3 approaches to assessing the impact of UI on quality of life are discussed, namely generic measures, disease-specific measures and qualitative approaches. We also review papers on UI and sexual functioning, UI in men, and some aspects of treatment. The review was conducted in the process of developing a new disease-specific measure for urinary urge incontinence (UUI). In general, the literature suggests that UUI has a greater impact than stress incontinence on quality of life, and that UI affects social and psychological functioning more than physical functioning. Only in a minority of individuals is the impact of UI disabling; however, most individuals with UI show significant reduction in their social functioning. Several studies suggest that the impact of UI is not solely a function of its severity, but also depends on individual coping abilities. Some studies also indicate that the social problems associated with UI grow with time, but it is not clear if that is a function of increasing severity of the condition, or the particular adaptations required for coping with this problem. An important distinction appears to be the ability of individuals to avoid public notice of their condition because of uncontrolled accidents. In summary, there is a need for a new measure of the quality-of-life impact of UUI that is based on the literature and on in-depth interviews with patients.",E,E

All subjects were EMs with respect to CYP2C19. The subjects received single oral doses of debrisoquine (10 mg), omeprazole (20 mg) and caffeine (100 mg) for determination of the appropriate metabolic ratios (MR). The drugs were given on separate consecutive days, before, during and after the co-administration of tolterodine.; Mean serum tolterodine concentrations were 5-10 times higher in PMs than in EMs. Serum concentrations of the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite of tolterodine, 5-HM, were not quantifiable in PMs. The mean MR of debrisoquine (95% confidence interval) during tolterodine treatment was 0.50 (0.25-0.99) and did not differ statistically from the values before [0.49 (0.20-1.2)] and after tolterodine administration [0.46 (0.14-1.6)] in EMs. The mean MR of omeprazole hydroxylation and sulphoxidation or caffeine metabolism were not changed in the presence of tolterodine in either EMs or PMs. Debrisoquine and caffeine had no significant effect on the AUC(1,3 h) of either tolterodine or 5-HM, but during omeprazole administration small decreases (13-19%) in these parameters were seen.; Tolterodine, administered at twice the expected therapeutic dosage, did not change the disposition of the probe drugs debrisoquine, omeprazole and caffeine and thus had no detectable effect on the activities of CYPs 2D6, 2C19, 3A4 and 1A2.

We investigated the effects of tolterodine and its major active metabolite, DD 01 (PNU-200577), (R)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-(2-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethylphenyl)-3-phenylpropa namine, on the contractions induced by carbachol, KCl, CaCl2 and electrical field stimulation in human isolated urinary bladder smooth muscles, using the muscle bath technique. Specimens of human urinary bladder were obtained from 20 patients who underwent total cystectomy due to malignant bladder tumor. The detrusor preparations were taken from the intact part of the dome region of the bladder. Carbachol (10(-9)-10(-2) M) caused concentration-dependent contraction of human detrusor smooth muscles. Tolterodine (10(-9)-10(-6) M), DD 01 (10(-9)-10(-6) M), oxybutynin (10(-8)-10(-6) M), propiverine (10(-8)-10(-6) M), atropine (10(-9)-10(-6) M), pirenzepine (10(-8)-10(-5) M), methoctramine (10(-8)-10(-5) M) and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) (10(-9)-10(-6) M) caused typical shifts to the right of the concentration-response curves for carbachol, except for higher concentrations (10(-5) M) of oxybutynin and propiverine, which caused a decrease of about 30% of the maximum contractile responses to carbachol. All the slopes of the regression lines of Schild plots were close to unity, and the rank order of pA2 values was: atropine = DD 01 = tolterodine = 4-DAMP = oxybutynin > propiverine = pirenzepine > methoctramine. Tolterodine (10(-9)-10(-6) M) and DD 01 (10(-9)-10(-6) M) did not inhibit the KCl-induced (80 mM) and CaCl2-induced (5 mM) contractions, while oxybutynin (10(-8)-10(-5) M) and propiverine (10(-8)-10(-5) M) significantly inhibited the contractions. Electrical field stimulation (2-60 Hz) caused frequency-dependent contraction of human detrusor smooth muscles, which were significantly inhibited by various drugs. In the presence of 10(-6) M atropine, tolterodine and DD 01 did not inhibit the residual contractions induced by electrical field stimulation at any of the frequencies, while oxybutynin (10(-5) M) and propiverine (10(-5) M) significantly inhibited the atropine-resistant part of the contractions. The results suggest that the inhibitory effects of tolterodine and DD 01 are mediated only by their antimuscarinic action, which is equal to that of oxybutynin and significantly greater than that of propiverine, and that tolterodine and DD 01 have neither Ca2+ channel antagonist action nor inhibitory effect on the atropine-resistant part of the contractions in human detrusor smooth muscles. These findings support the usefulness of tolterodine as a therapeutic drug for overactive bladder with symptoms of frequency, urgency and urge incontinence.",E,E

Binding of tolterodine and the two metabolites to human serum albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) was also assessed, as was binding of tolterodine to red blood cells. Ex vivo protein binding of tolterodine and 5-HM was determined in serum samples from healthy volunteers treated with oral tolterodine 4 mg twice daily for 8 days. Tolterodine exhibited high protein binding in human serum; the unbound fraction (f(u)) was 3.7%. The unbound fraction of tolterodine in cat and dog serum (1.5 and 2.1%, respectively) was lower compared with human serum; f(u) was higher in the other species investigated (rat, 22%; mouse, 16-17%; rabbit, 39%). The unbound fraction of 5-HM was much higher in serum from humans (36%) and all animal species investigated (mouse, 72%; rabbit, 68%; cat, 32%; dog, 45%). Binding of N-dealkylated tolterodine to proteins in human serum was intermediate (f(u) 14%). AAG was the major binding protein for tolterodine and 5-HM, and the degree of binding increased with increasing concentration of the protein. The association constant of 5-HM for AAG was lower than that of tolterodine (1.3 x 10(5) M(-1) versus 2.1 x 10(6) M(-1)). The blood:plasma tolterodine concentration ratio was 0.6 in both humans and dog; thus, a minor fraction of tolterodine was present in red blood cells compared with plasma (0.18 and 0.36, respectively). In the mouse, tolterodine was equally present in blood and plasma. In ex vivo samples, f(u) values for tolterodine (pH adjusted) varied between 1.6 and 4.9% (mean 2.8%), which could be explained by differences in AAG concentrations. There was good correlation between observed f(u) values for tolterodine and those predicted on the basis of AAG levels. Similar findings were observed for 5-HM.",E,E

It acts by muscarinic receptor blockade in the bladder wall and detrusor muscle. Despite short terminal disposition half-lives of 2-3 and 3-4 hours for tolterodine and its active 5-hydroxy metabolite, respectively, twice/day dosing is effective due to the drug's prolonged pharmacodynamic effects. Dosage adjustment is recommended in the presence of hepatic impairment and during concurrent therapy with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 and 3A4 isozymes. Tolterodine significantly reduces clinically relevant end points such as number of micturitions and number of incontinence episodes/day. In general, it is superior to placebo and equivalent to oxybutynin in this regard. As might be expected from its pharmacologic profile, the principal adverse effects of the drug are anticholinergic. In clinical trials, tolterodine was tolerated significantly better than oxybutynin. Its relative merits as a first- or second-line agent for patients intolerant of oxybutynin are unclear. Until pharmacoeconomic analyses are conducted that clearly justify use of this more expensive agent, tolterodine is perhaps best reserved for patients who are intolerant of or fail oxybutynin therapy.",E,E

Micturition diary and urodynamic variables and subjective urinary symptoms were assessed after 2 weeks of treatment. Patients were classified as ""extensive"" or ""poor"" metabolizers of tolterodine on the basis of serum levels of tolterodine.; A per-protocol analysis of efficacy in 262 patients showed dose-related improvements in micturition diary and urodynamic variables. A dosage of 4 mg twice daily was, however, associated with an increase in residual urinary volume. The incidence of adverse events (mainly mild or moderate antimuscarinic effects) was comparable between placebo and tolterodine dosages of 2 mg twice daily. No serious drug-related adverse events were observed, and tolterodine had no clinically significant impact on electrocardiographic or laboratory findings. Changes in urodynamic variables were found to be related to the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and its major active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. In poor and extensive metabolizers of tolterodine, exposure to the sum of these active moieties was similar, and the efficacy and safety profiles were comparable.; The results of this pooled data analysis indicate that tolterodine offers an effective treatment for patients with urinary symptoms attributable to overactive bladder. The optimal dosage is 1 to 2 mg twice daily, irrespective of metabolic phenotype.",E,E

Results of recent clinical trials demonstrate differences in tolerance between antimuscarinic drugs. It is the purpose of this paper to relate the available clinical data to the pharmacological and physicochemical properties of the different antimuscarinic drugs, in order to discuss the reasons for this enhanced tolerance and to make possible modes for improvement of antimuscarinic therapy plainly visible.; Therefore, we reviewed the available literature using among others the computerized library systems Medline (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) and Embase (Excerpta Medica, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Differences in tolerance of oral antimuscarinic drugs may result from muscarine-receptor selectivity, organ selectivity, and pharmacokinetic as well as physicochemical properties. While the roles of m-receptor and organ selectivity need more detailed clarification, influences of differences in bioavailability and physicochemical properties on the tolerance of antimuscarinic drugs are more sufficiently investigated.; Generally, tolerance as well as efficacy of antimuscarinic drugs seem to be a complex result of a combination of various pharmacological properties distinguishing the individual substances. The enhancement of tolerance of propiverine hydrochloride, tolterodine tartrate and trospium chloride compared to oxybutynin chloride seems to be reached by different modes, from which the molecular structure -- propiverine and tolterodine are tertiary amines, trospium chloride possesses a quarternary ammonium structure -- may be of great importance. First investigations with alternative transdermal and intravesical application routes show interesting possibilities for further improvement of antimuscarinic therapy in urological indications.; In conclusion, from pharmacological and clinical data it becomes obvious that there are significant differences between antimuscarinic drugs, which are of clinical relevance and include possible starting points for the development of new drugs and application forms.",I,E
10363730,An extended-release formulation of oxybutynin chloride for the treatment of overactive urinary bladder.,Cholinergic Antagonists; Clinical Trials as Topic; Delayed-Action Preparations; Humans; Mandelic Acids; Parasympatholytics; Urinary Incontinence; Urination Disorders,"Goldenberg, M M","Detrusor instability, or urinary incontinence, is common in elderly patients, particularly elderly women. The clinical symptoms of overactive, or unstable, urinary bladder include urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency. Mixed urinary incontinence, which comprises urge urinary incontinence and stress incontinence, is manifested by increased intraabdominal pressure on coughing or sneezing. The detrusor muscle of the bladder is under the control of the parasympathetic, or muscarinic, nervous system. The drug of choice in this condition is oxybutynin chloride, which has the ability to block acetylcholine released from parasympathetic nerves in the urinary bladder, preventing contractions of the muscle and exerting a direct spasmolytic effect on the bladder. A new extended-release oral tablet formulation, OROS oxybutynin, uses osmotic pressure to deliver the drug at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. It resembles a conventional tablet but has a two-part core consisting of a drug layer and below it, a ""push"" layer containing osmotically active components, the whole surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with a laser-drilled opening in the drug side. Water in the gastrointestinal tract enters the tablet and mixes with the drug to form a suspension. The ""push"" layer expands and pushes the suspended drug out of the orifice and into the gastrointestinal tract for eventual absorption. Pharmacokinetic studies have indicated a slow rise in mean plasma concentration of the isomer R-oxybutynin for 4 to 6 hours after a single dose of OROS oxybutynin, followed by maintenance of steady concentrations for up to 24 hours, minimizing the fluctuations between peak and trough associated with TID dosing of 5-mg immediate-release oxybutynin tablets. Efficacy and safety studies comparing the extended-release with the immediate-release formulation of oxybutynin demonstrated equivalent efficacy in patients with overactive urinary bladder. The adverse-event profile of oxybutynin is similar to that of a typical anticholinergic agent such as atropine--dry mouth, constipation, somnolence, blurred vision, headache, and gastrointestinal pain--although in 2 clinical studies, the incidence of dry mouth was less with the extended-release formulation. Once-daily dosing with OROS oxybutynin appears to be well tolerated and effective, as well as convenient, for the treatment of overactive bladder, particularly for elderly patients using multiple medications.",E,E

Affinity estimates were obtained for several muscarinic antagonists against carbachol-stimulated [3H]-inositol phosphates accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-KI) cells stably expressing either human muscarinic M3 or M5 receptor subtypes. The rationale for these studies was to generate a functional antagonist affinity profile for the M5 receptor subtype and compare this with that of the M3 receptor, in order to identify compounds which discriminate between these two subtypes. 2. The rank order of antagonist apparent affinities (pK(B)) at the muscarinic M5 receptor was atropine (8.7) > or =tolterodine (8.6) = 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP, 8.6)> darifenacin (7.7) > or =zamifenacin (7.6)>oxybutynin (6.6)= para-fluorohexahydrosiladifenidol (p-F-HHSiD, 6.6)>pirenzepine (6.4) > or = methoctramine (6.3)=himbacine (6.3)>AQ-RA 741 (6.1). 3. Antagonist apparent affinities for both receptor subtypes compare well with published binding affinity estimates. No antagonist displayed greater selectivity for the muscarinic M5 subtype over the M3 subtype, but himbacine, AQ-RA 741, p-F-HHSiD, darifenacin and oxybutynin displayed between 9- and 60 fold greater selectivity for the muscarinic M3 over the M5 subtype. 4. This study highlights the similarity in pharmacological profiles of M3 and M5 receptor subtypes and identifies five antagonists that may represent useful tools for discriminating between these two subtypes. Collectively, these data show that in the absence of a high affinity M5 selective antagonist, affinity data for a large range of antagonists is critical to define operationally the M5 receptor subtype.",E,E

Several different pharmacological actions are potentially useful depending on the underlying cause of the incontinence: a) Detrusor instability (DI) responds to drugs reducing bladder contractility: Anticholinergic agents, e.g. oxybutynin and tolterodine, act at postganglionic parasympathetic cholinergic receptor sites on the detrusor muscle, reducing the strength of the detrusor contraction. Tricyclic antidepressants, e.g. imipramine, have anticholinergic effects, block presynaptic uptake of amine neurotransmitters and directly inhibit detrusor muscle. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists may have a role to play by dual actions on bladder overactivity (due to altered receptor function) and by reducing outlet resistance. b) Genuine stress incontinence (GSI) may be treated using alpha-adrenergic agonists, e.g. phenylpropanolamine, to increase outlet resistance by stimulating smooth muscle of the urethra and bladder neck. c) In nocturnal enuresis reduction of nocturnal urine output with the anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) analogue DDAVP (1-deamino, 8-arginine vasopressin) is beneficial. d) Bladder emptying may be facilitated in patients with retention and 'overflow' incontinence by alpha-adrenergic antagonists, which reduce outlet resistance, and perhaps by parasympathomimetics, e.g. bethanecol. e) In postmenopausal women, systemic oestrogen replacement reduces filling symptoms including urge incontinence. Evidence for oestrogen replacement alone in GSI is lacking, but combination with alpha-agonists is beneficial in milder GSI. For the future, tolterodine and other new anticholinergics offer the hope of treatment for DI with fewer of the side effects that limit the use of established drugs. Better understanding of the pathophysiology of DI may provide new targets for drug therapy, such as hyperpolarisation of detrusor muscle membrane. Alpha-agonists may find a greater role in the future, as may ADH analogues for noctural symptoms.",E,E

The objectives of this descriptive study were to examine utilization patterns and discontinuation rates of various pharmacologic agents used to treat symptoms of overactive bladder, primarily urge incontinence (UI), and to estimate the prevalence of urinary incontinence in the study population. Patient-level data regarding specific drugs used to treat UI and the use of diapers or pads over a 9-month period from October 1995 to May 1996 were retrospectively extracted from the medication databases of 9 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. A total of 2233 male patients were included in the analyses. Most patients were receiving oxybutynin chloride (39.8%), dicyclomine hydrochloride (16.0%), or imipramine hydrochloride (13.9%), and the remaining 30.3% were using flavoxate hydrochloride, propantheline bromide, hyoscyamine sulfate, and adult diapers or pads. Overall, 72.1% of patients had been prescribed daily dosages within the recommended dosing ranges for these medications. The majority (91.3%) of patients had not switched to another UI medication during the study period. Based on a chronic disease index, 47.6% of patients had 2 or fewer chronic diseases. Using pooled prevalence estimates, the estimated percentage of patients who had ever experienced UI in this population ranged from 7.4% to 20.8%; however, a considerably smaller percentage were taking medications for the treatment of UI. The results of this study suggest that oxybutynin, dicyclomine, and imipramine are the agents most commonly used to treat urinary incontinence within Veterans Affairs medical centers. The majority of patients who received a prescription for one of these drugs did not routinely refill the medication over the course of the study. There are many reasons for patients not to refill a prescription (eg, ineffectiveness, side effects, complications, obtaining the drug from another source), but the present study did not address the causes.",E,E

In order to elucidate whether anticholinergic drug is also effective for these symptoms related to bladder hypersensitivity (sensory urgency), clinical efficacy of oxybutynin on sensory urgency was compared with that on motor urgency.; Twenty-four patients with sensory urgency, and 53 patients with motor urgency were treated with oxybutynin (6 mg/day) for 4 weeks and subjective and objective efficacies were evaluated. Subjective parameters were quantified with urge score (grade 0-3) and daily numbers of voiding and incontinence. Objective efficacies were evaluated with pre-/ postcomparison of cystometric parameters.; Excellent or good overall efficacy was obtained in 62.5% (15/24) of the sensory urgency group and 60.4% (32/53) of the motor urgency group. There was no statistical difference between these two groups. Objective cystometric parameters, bladder volume at first sensation and maximum cystometric capacity, statistically improved after the treatment in both groups.; The results suggest that oxybutynin works as well on sensory urgency as it does on motor urgency.",E,E

After a 2-week run-in period (visit 1), the patients were started on tolterodine 1 mg twice a day (bid) (visit 2). They were followed at 4 and 8 weeks (visits 3 and 4). The patients were contacted by telephone 1 week after visit 2. Tolterodine was increased to 2 mg bid if the patient had incomplete improvement at either the initial phone call or during visit 3. Evaluation criteria were daily micturition charts including urinary frequency, nocturia, leakage episodes, average urine volume per day, and average voided volume. Tolterodine was well tolerated without side effects in 20 (80%) of 28 patients. Eight patients (20%) dropped out after enrollment because of side effects in 3, no improvement in 2, and missing visits (>1) in 3. Drug dosage in the 20 patients who tolerated tolterodine was 1 mg bid in 3 and 2 mg bid in 17 (85%). According to micturition charts, urinary frequency, nocturia, and leakage episodes decreased significantly after tolterodine treatment, whereas average urine volume per day and average voided volume did not change significantly. There were no electrocardiographic or biochemical abnormalities due to tolterodine treatment. Mean follow-up was 9.4 months. All 20 patients who tolerated tolterodine continue to take the medication without significant side effects. We conclude that tolterodine is well tolerated and effective for overactive bladders.

The findings with clinical investigations are specific, but not sensitive enough, and the spinal cord lesions may sometimes be beyond the resolution of magnetic resonance-scanning. Pharmacotherapy is still the corner stone in the management of detrusor hyperreflexia. Further studies with tolterodine, oxybutynin, trospiumchloride and propiverine have increased our knowledge about these substances. Capsaicin was proved to be the effective substance and not the alcoholic solution, which serves as a carrier. Intrathecal clonidine may represent a new conservative reversible alternative treatment for detrusor hyperreflexia. Experiments with detrusor strips from end-stage MMC-patients may explain the relative resistance of the low compliant bladder to the common anticholinergic/spasmolytic therapy. The differential indication for bladder augmentation, either using segments of the gastrointestinal-tract or performing a partial detrusor myectomy is ongoing, favourable results are reported for both techniques. Sacral posterior root rhizotomy is able to abolish detrusor hyperreflexia and therefore recommended for tetra- and paraplegics, however autonomic dysreflexia, if present, can not be totally abolished.

Propiverine (group 1, 15 mg three times daily), oxybutynin (group 2, 5 mg twice daily) or placebo (group 3) were administered for 4 weeks, using the double-dummy technique. The dosages were selected specifically to compare the tolerability profile of propiverine with the commonly used therapeutic dosage of oxybutynin. Tolerability was assessed by directly questioning the patients about adverse events at four visits (V-1 before and V0 after a 1-week 'washout' period, V1 after 1 week and V4 after 4 weeks of treatment) during a 5-week surveillance period, and by tolerability ratings of the physicians. Efficacy was assessed using urodynamics at V0 and V4, evaluating the cystometric bladder capacity at maximal and first desire to void, and postvoid residual urine, according to the criteria of the International Continence Society. Additionally, a voiding protocol, overall assessment of clinical symptomatology and efficacy ratings by the physicians were documented.; A remarkably high percentage of adverse events was reported in the washout period (VO: 13%, 16% and 18% in groups 1-3, respectively). At V4, the clinically most relevant symptom (dry mouth) occurred in 53% of patients in group 1, in 67% of group 2 and in 28% of group 3. Furthermore, dry mouth was less severe in group 1 than group 2. In contrast to groups 2 and 3, only patients in group 1 showed increasing tolerability during the treatment (from V1 to V4). These tolerability results were further supported by the overall tolerability assessment ('very good' or 'good' tolerability in 67% of group 1, in 59% of group 2 and in 83% of group 3). The urodynamic assessment of efficacy (comparing V0 and V4) showed a statistically significant increase in the mean (sd) maximal cystometric bladder capacity in group 1, being 222 (77) mL at V0 and 311 (125) mL at V4, an increase of 89 (108) mL, and in group 2, at 226 (75) mL and 322 (123) mL, an increase of 96 (106) mL, compared with group 3, at 211 (77) mL and 263 (93) mL, an increase of only 52 (92) mL. The cystometric bladder capacity at first desire to void also increased in group 1 (93 to 160 mL) and group 2 (89 to 160 mL), whereas in group 3 there were only minor changes (93 to 120 mL). Changes in the residual urine volume within and between the treatment groups were minimal and clinically irrelevant. The overall assessment of efficacy showed significant differences between the drugs when compared with placebo.; Propiverine is a safe and effective drug in the treatment of urgency and urge incontinence; it is as effective as oxybutynin, but the incidence of dry mouth and its severity is less with propiverine than with oxybutynin. The availability of alternative pharmacotherapeutics such as propiverine should reduce the therapeutic failure rate and improves the success rate in the treatment of patients suffering from urgency and urge incontinence.",I,I

There were 10 women and 5 men. All patients were either poor candidates for or refused continent urinary diversion or bladder augmentation cystoplasty.; At a mean follow-up of 23.2 months, 14 of 15 patients had low-pressure urine drainage through their ileovesicostomy. Four women with documented preoperative detrusor hyperreflexia had postoperative intermittent mild urge incontinence per native urethra. They did not require any further treatment, except for oral anticholinergic drugs (oxybutynin and tolterodine). Because of persistent severe urge incontinence, 1 woman required conversion of her ileovesicostomy to an ileal conduit with concurrent cystectomy. The ileovesicostomy of another myelodysplastic man who had four failed artificial urinary sphincters in the past was also converted to an ileal conduit because of persistent urethroperineal fistula despite perineal urethral closure. Renal function was preserved in all patients. Long-term complications were stomal stenosis in 2 patients, bladder and kidney stone formation in 5, and symptomatic urinary tract infections in 3.; Ileovesicostomy can be safely performed in neurologically impaired women and men. Severe preoperative detrusor hyperreflexia with urge incontinence appears to be a risk factor for persistent urge incontinence postoperatively in women. Continued routine urologic surveillance for infection and stones is mandatory. Ileovesicostomy is a versatile procedure for neurologically impaired patients, because it can be converted to a conventional ileal conduit if necessary. In addition, in cases of neural recovery, the ileal ""chimney"" can be excised and the patient's original lower urinary tract would be preserved.",E,E

Pertinent articles written in English were considered for review. Additional articles were identified from the bibliographies of retrieved articles. Data from the Food and Drug Administration-approved product labeling and the manufacturer were also used in the absence of published data.; Clinical studies of tolterodine involving human subjects were evaluated.; Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist with relative functional selectivity for bladder muscarinic receptors. It is metabolized in the liver by CYP2D6 to an active metabolite (DD 01), which is partially responsible for its pharmacologic activity. Those who are genetically devoid of CYP2D6 will have higher concentrations of the parent compound and virtually undetectable concentrations of DD 01; however, the clinical efficacy does not appear to be altered. In dosages of 2 mg twice daily, tolterodine has shown consistent reductions in the number of micturitions per 24 hours and less consistently decreased incontinence episodes in patients with detrusor overactivity. The functional selectivity of tolterodine for bladder muscarinic receptors results in fewer systemic adverse effects, such as dry mouth, than occur with comparable nonselective antimuscarinic agents.; Clinical studies have shown that the effectiveness of tolterodine for symptoms of overactive bladder is similar to that of oxybutynin. The adverse effect profiles of tolterodine and oxybutynin are similar; however, comparative clinical trials have shown significantly fewer patients taking tolterodine require dosage reductions or discontinue therapy due to antimuscarinic adverse effects such as dry mouth. Although more costly than oxybutynin, tolterodine represents a modest improvement over oxybutynin with respect to adverse effect profile, which may allow more patients with incontinence to tolerate therapeutic doses.

Other medications for concurrent medical diagnoses had remained unchanged. One patient had an episode of prostatitis, which was treated with levofloxacin immediately prior to tolterodine initiation. The warfarin dosage had remained constant for many weeks in both patients prior to and during the tolterodine trials. In each patient, the initiation of tolterodine was associated with a significant increase in the patient's INR measured 10-14 days later. Thus, tolterodine was ineffective in both patients and was discontinued one to two days before the elevated INRs were determined during routine clinic visits. INRs determined approximately two weeks after tolterodine was discontinued were similar to those obtained during the period before the use of the drug; the warfarin dosage remained unchanged. Rechallenge with tolterodine was not attempted in either patient.; Several aspects of the reported cases support the validity of a proposed drug interaction when tolterodine is initiated in a patient stabilized on warfarin therapy. The temporal association of the course of tolterodine with an elevated INR, the return to the previous warfarin dose-INR response relationship after tolterodine discontinuation, and the absence of other causes for the elevated INR were factors found in both patients. Possible mechanisms to explain the suggested drug interaction are explored.; Until further data are available, clinicians should be vigilant for a possible drug interaction when tolterodine therapy is initiated in a patient maintained on warfarin therapy.",I,8

They were characterized as extensive metabolizers (EM1 with one functional CYP2D6 gene, EM2 with two functional genes) or poor metabolizers (PM).; Nine patients, three EM2 and four EM1 and two PM, completed the trial. Following tolterodine administration, the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of tolterodine was 4.4-times and 30-times higher among EM1 and PM, respectively, compared with EM2. The AUC of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (5-HM) was not quantifiable in PM. Fluoxetine significantly decreased (P<0.002) the oral clearance of tolterodine by 93% in EM2 and by 80% in EM1. The AUC of 5-HM increased in EM2 and decreased in EM1. However, the exposure to the active moiety (unbound tolterodine +5-HM) was not significantly increased in the two phenotypes. The subdivision of the EM group showed a 2.1-fold increase in active moiety in EM2 but the exposure was still similar to EM1 compared with before the interaction.; The study suggests a difference in the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine and its 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite depending on the number of functional CYP2D6 genes.

Metabolic activities were determined in liver microsomes from two donors using the following selective substrates: dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), denitronifedipine (CYP3A4), caffeine (CYP1A2), chlorzoxazone (CYP2E1), S-(+)-mephenytoin (CYP2C19), S-(-)-warfarin (CYP2C9) and coumarin (CYP2A6). Incubations with each substrate were carried out without a possible inhibitor and in the presence of trospium chloride at varying concentrations (37-3000 microM) at 37 degrees in 0.1 M KH2PO4 buffer containing up to 3% DMSO. Metabolite concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in all cases except CYP2A6 where direct fluorescence spectroscopy was used. First, trospium chloride IC50 values were determined for each substrate at respective K(M) concentrations. Trospium chloride did not show relevant inhibitory effects on the metabolism of most substrates (IC50 values considerably higher than 1 mM). The only clear inhibition was seen for the CYP2D6-dependent high-affinity O-demethylation of dextromethorphan, where IC50 values of 27 microM and 44 microM were observed. Therefore, additional dextromethorphan concentrations (0.4-2000 microM) were tested. Trospium chloride was a competitive inhibitor of the reaction with Ki values of 20 and 51 microM, respectively. Thus, trospium chloride has negligible inhibitory effects on CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2A6 activity but is a reasonably potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro. Compared to therapeutic trospium chloride peak plasma concentrations below 50 nM, the 1000-times higher competitive inhibition constant Ki however suggests that inhibition of CYP2D6 by trospium chloride is without any clinical relevance.",E,E

During this time period these agents have superseded griseofulvin as the agent of choice for onychomycosis. Unlike griseofulvin, the new agents have a broad spectrum of action that includes dermatophytes, Candida species and nondermatophyte moulds. Each of the 3 oral antifungal agents, terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole, is effective against dermatophytes with relatively fewer data being available for the treatment of Candida species and nondermatophyte moulds. Itraconazole is effective against Candida onychomycosis. Terbinafine may be more effective against C. parapsilosis compared with C. albicans; furthermore with Candida species a higher dose of terbinafine or a longer duration of therapy may be required compared with the regimen for dermatophytes. The least amount of experience in treating onychomycosis is with fluconazole. Griseofulvin is not effective against Candida species or the nondermatophyte moulds. The main use of griseo-fulvin currently is to treat tinea capitis. Ketoconazole may be used by some to treat tinea versicolor with the dosage regimens being short and requiring the use of only a few doses. The preferred regimens for the 3 oral antimycotic agents are as follows: itraconazole - pulse therapy with the drug being administered for 1 week with 3 weeks off treatment between successive pulses; terbinafine - continuous once daily therapy; and fluconazole - once weekly treatment. The regimen for the treatment of dermatophyte onychomycosis is: itraconazole - 200mg twice daily for I week per month x 3 pulses; terbinafine - 250 mg/day for 12 weeks; or, fluconazole - 150 mg/wk until the abnormal-appearing nail plate has grown out, typically over a period of 9 to 18 months. For the 3 oral antifungal agents the more common adverse reactions pertain to the following systems, gastrointestinal (for example, nausea, gastrointestinal distress, diarrhoea, abdominal pain), cutaneous eruption, and CNS (for example, headache and malaise). Each of the new antifungal agents is more cost-effective than griseofulvin for the treatment of onychomycosis and is associated with high compliance, in part because of the shorter duration of therapy. The newer antifungal agents are generally well tolerated with drug interactions that are usually predictable.",E,E

However, these drugs often have troublesome side effects and frequently are given in doses insufficient to restore continence in patients with detrusor instability. We present the background and basic and clinical research dealing with intravesical instillation of capsaicin and resinfferatoxin as treatments for the overactive bladder. Capsaicin is the main pungent ingredient in ""hot"" peppers of the genus Capsicum. It is a specific neurotoxin that desensitizes C-fiber afferent neurons, which may be responsible for the signals that trigger detrusor overactivity. Studies with capsaicin over the past 8 years have demonstrated clinical efficacy with minimal long-term complications. Most of these studies have also shown that the acute pain and irritation associated with capsaicin are a major deterrent to widespread use.

Few trials have evaluated the effect of PFM training on symptoms of overactive bladder. Most studies are flawed because they include several diagnoses and treatment modalities in the same intervention. Because of the lack of evidence, no firm conclusion can be drawn on the effect of PFM exercise on overactive bladder. There are some initially promising results, but there is still a need for high-quality, randomized controlled trials on the effect of PFM training on the inhibition of detrusor contraction in human beings.

However, treatment-limiting adverse effects such as dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision have restricted the usefulness of previously available agents, such as oxybutynin. A real need therefore existed for effective and well-tolerated agents for the long-term management of the troublesome symptoms of overactive bladder. This review outlines the various approaches that have been used in attempts to overcome the tolerability problems of oxybutynin. It also describes how advances in our understanding of muscarinic receptors and bladder function has led to the potential development of either tissue- or subtype-selective antimuscarinic agents with improved tolerability. Drugs that have been developed in this way include tolterodine and darifenacin, each of which shows some bladder selectivity in animal models. Unlike darifenacin, however, the bladder selectivity of tolterodine has been confirmed by numerous clinical studies. Tolterodine's improved tolerability compared with oxybutynin, along with its equivalent therapeutic efficacy at recommended dosages, permits patients to experience the beneficial effects of long-term treatment. Tolterodine therefore represents a real alternative for the long-term management of overactive bladder. The results of ongoing clinical studies with darifenacin are awaited before it can be concluded that selective antagonism of M(3) receptors leads to improved tolerability over existing agents in the treatment of overactive bladder. Similarly, the potential improvements in tolerability associated with different dosage formulations of oxybutynin, and the clinical utility of S-oxybutynin, are yet to be conclusively demonstrated.",E,E

The study was of 6 weeks' duration, i.e. 2 weeks of screening whilst taking conventional oxybutynin tablets (5 mg twice daily) followed by 4 weeks of double-blind treatment with either CR oxybutynin tablets (10 mg once daily) or conventional oxybutynin tablets (5 mg twice daily). Outcome measures were changes in 24-h frequency and 24-h incontinence episodes recorded throughout the study on diary charts. Adverse events were recorded by patients in their diary charts and serum concentrations of oxybutynin and its active metabolite, N-desethyloxybutynin, were measured at baseline and at completion of the study to detect possible drug accumulation.; The treatments did not differ significantly in any of the outcome measures. The primary efficacy criterion was the daytime continence at completion of the study; 53% and 58% of patients were continent on CR and conventional oxybutynin treatments, respectively (the 95% confidence interval of the difference in the proportion being - 22% to 13%; P = 0.62). The total number of side-effects experienced by those patients receiving treatment with the CR formulation was 57% of that for patients receiving treatment with conventional oxybutynin. Individual side-effects showed a similar distribution within treatment groups. There was no evidence of the accumulation of oxybutynin or N-desethyloxybutynin during the multiple dosing of CR or conventional oxybutynin tablets.; The CR and conventional formulations of oxybutynin did not differ in their efficacy, and the CR formulation was associated with fewer side-effects. In addition, CR oxybutynin appeared to maintain therapeutic blood levels over the 24 h dosing interval with no accumulation of oxybutynin or its active metabolite. Once-daily dosing with a CR tablet is seen as convenient for the patient and is expected to result in improved compliance in patients already stabilized on conventional oxybutynin treatment.",I,I

Historically the most effective treatment has been muscular relaxing agents and anticholinergic agents. We present a prospective, double blind, cross, placebo control study to evaluate efficacy and tolerance of oxybutynin in women with unstable bladder. We included 44 adult women with unstable bladder, 22 unitially received oxybutynin 5 mg t.i.d. and 22 placebo 5 mg t.i.d. aleatory in both groups through 6 weeks, later wash-out period was performed and those women in which initially received oxybutynin were administered placebo and those women in which initially received placebo, were administered oxybutynin, for another six weeks. Five patients which initiated the study with oxybutynin abandoned the study, 2 of them for intolerance and 3 for unknown causes. Two women in which initially received placebo abandoned follow-up too. A total of 74 subjects (37 for each branch of study) had an age average of 51.7. Symptoms scoring decreased from 13 to 11 and 6 points with placebo and oxybutynin respectively (p = 0.001). The analog visual scale of symptoms decreased from 77% to 62.5% and 40% with placebo and oxybutynin respectively (p = 0.003). The overall rate of improvement evaluated through symptoms scoring was from 27% with placebo and 72.9% with oxybutynin (p = 0.000) and evaluated through analog visual scale of symptoms was from 40% with placebo and 78.3% with oxybutynin (p = 0.002). The vesical volume at first voiding sensation increased from 129 ml to 134 ml and 187 ml with placebo and oxybutynin respectively (p = 0.021) and the maximum cystometric capacity increased from 231 ml to 236 ml and 301 ml with placebo and oxybutynin respectively.

Ninety-eight patients (21 male, 77 female; 67.7+/-6.3 years of age) suffering from urgency, urge incontinence or mixed urge-stress incontinence were included in the double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled, randomized study. After a 2-week placebo run-in period, the patients received propiverine (15 mg t.i.d.) or placebo (t.i.d.) for 4 weeks. Before (V1, V2) and during the treatment period (V3, V4), standard ECGs and 24-hour long-term ECGs were recorded. Propiverine caused a significant reduction of the micturition frequency (V2: 8.7+/-4.2, V4: 6.5+/-3.2 ml; p< or =0.01), reflected in a significant increase in the average micturition volume (V2: 163.5+/-65.9, V4: 216.3+/-101.5 ml; p< or =0.01) and a significant decrease in episodes of incontinence (-54%; p = 0.048). These findings were confirmed by the overall assessment at V4, in which approximately 90% of patients under propiverine either had no urge incontinence or urge symptoms, or showed improvement. Resting and ambulatory electrocardiograms indicated no significant changes. Neither the frequency-corrected Q-T interval nor other cardiac parameters were relevantly altered. The frequency of cardiac events (Lown classes IVa/b) was random, revealing no difference between placebo and propiverine. The incidence of adverse events was very low (2% dryness of the mouth under propiverine) and confirmed by the findings from the quality of life questionnaires. A favourable benefit-risk ratio without the induction of any cardiac arrhythmia in the treatment of elderly patients suffering from urgency, urge incontinence or combined urge-stress incontinence is therefore proven for propiverine.",E,E

Patients present with a variety of symptoms, including urinary obstruction, fever, myalgias, decreased libido or impotence, painful ejaculation and low-back and perineal pain. Physical examination often fails to clarify the cause of the pain. Cultures and microscopic examination of urine and prostatic secretions before and after prostatic massage may help differentiate prostatitis caused by infection from prostatitis with other causes. Because the rate of occult infection is high, a therapeutic trial of antibiotics is often in order even when patients do not appear to have bacterial prostatitis. If the patient responds to therapy, antibiotics are continued for at least three to four weeks, although some men require treatment for several months. A patient who does not respond might be evaluated for chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, in which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, alpha-blocking agents, anticholinergic agents or other therapies may provide symptomatic relief.",E,E

Sildenafil has previously been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction due to SCI. This study is the first to evaluate the sexual and cardiovascular effects of sildenafil in women with SCIs in a controlled, laboratory setting.; Nineteen premenopausal women with SCIs were randomly assigned to receive either sildenafil (50 mg) or placebo in a double-blind, crossover design study. Physiologic and subjective measures of sexual response, heart rate, and blood pressure were recorded during baseline and sexual stimulation conditions. Adverse events were also recorded.; Significant increases in subjective arousal (SA) were observed with both drug (P <0.01) and sexual stimulation conditions (P <0.001), and a borderline significant (P <0.07) effect of drug administration on vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) was noted. Maximal responses occurred when sildenafil was combined with visual and manual sexual stimulation. Cardiovascular data showed modest increases in heart rate (+/-5 bpm) and mild decreases in blood pressure (+/-4 mm Hg) across all stimulation conditions, consistent with the peripheral vasodilatory mechanism of the drug. Sildenafil was well tolerated with no evidence of significant adverse events.; Findings suggest that sildenafil may partially reverse the sexual dysfunction commonly associated with SCI in women. Consistent with previous findings in men, the sexual effects of the drug were most evident under conditions of optimal stimulation. Mild, clinically insignificant cardiovascular effects were also noted. Further large-scale studies of sildenafil's effects in women with neurogenic sexual dysfunction are strongly indicated.",E,E

There are a variety of therapeutic options available for the treatment of UI, although pharmacologic intervention is presently a relatively minor component of overall care; this suggests that effective drug therapy might play a more significant role in the future. The economic burden associated with the care of the incontinent patient is substantial, and in the US the direct medical cost of the disease was estimated at $25.5 billion in 1995. The disease also has a large impact on the individual UI patient, negatively affecting many parameters normally associated with a tolerable health-related quality of life.",E,E

Within the concentration ranges tested (trospium chloride 10(-11)-10(-6) mol/l, flavoxate and oxybutynin 10(-9)-10(-5) mol/l, tolterodine 10(-10)-10(-5) mol/l), each drug caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of the tension elicited by muscarinic stimulation and dose-dependently attenuated the contractions induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS). The effects of trospium chloride and tolterodine on carbachol-induced muscarinic tension were more pronounced than those of oxybutynin, while trospium chloride and oxybutynin were most effective in inhibiting the contractions induced by EFS. Flavoxate was significantly less effective than all other drugs tested. Regardless the individual drug concentrations needed for maximal efficacy, the potency of oxybutynin and flavoxate to reverse muscarinic tension and attenuate EFS-evoked contractions was almost comparable while tolterodine and trospium chloride were more effective in relaxing the muscarinic tension of the detrusor strip preparations than causing inhibition of EFS-induced contractions.

CYP27A has been extensively studied, but its role as a physiologically important vitamin D(3) 25-hydroxylase has been questioned. The present paper reports that the microsomal vitamin D(3) 25-hydroxylase, purified from pig liver, converted vitamin D(3) into 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) in substrate concentrations which are within the physiological range (apparent K(m) = 0.1 microm). The enzyme 25-hydroxylated vitamin D(3), 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D(3) and vitamin D(2) and also converted tolterodine, a substrate for human CYP2D6, into its 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Tolterodine inhibited the microsomal 25-hydroxylation, whereas quinidine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, did not markedly inhibit the reaction. The primary structure of the microsomal vitamin D(3) 25-hydroxylase, designated CYP2D25, shows 77% identity with that of human CYP2D6. Northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments revealed that CYP2D25 mRNA is expressed in higher levels in liver than in kidney and in small amounts in adrenals, brain, heart, intestine, lung, muscle, spleen, and thymus. Experiments with human liver microsomes and recombinantly expressed CYP2D6 strongly indicate that the microsomal 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D(3) in human liver is catalyzed by an enzyme different from CYP2D6.",E,E

Materials and methods Specimens of human urinary bladder were obtained from 20 patients who underwent total cystectomy for malignant bladder tumour. Using an organ-bath technique, the effects of various drugs on the contractions induced by carbachol, KCl, CaCl2 and electrical field stimulation in the detrusor strips were investigated.; Carbachol (0.001-10000 micromol/L) caused concentration-dependent contractions in human detrusor smooth muscles. Tolterodine (0.01-10 micromol/L), vamicamide (0.01-10 micromol/L), temiverine (0.01-1 micromol/L) and atropine (0.001-1 micromol/L) caused parallel shifts to the right of the concentration-response curves to carbachol. All slopes for the regression line of Schild plots were close to unity, and the rank order of pA2 values was atropine = tolterodine > vamicamide > temiverine. Tolterodine, vamicamide and atropine did not inhibit the maximum contractile responses to carbachol, while temiverine (10 micromol/L) significantly inhibited the maximum contractions. Tolterodine (0.001-1 micromol/L) and vamicamide (0.01-10 micromol/L) did not inhibit the KCl- (80 mmol/L) and CaCl2-induced (5 mmol/L) contractions, while temiverine (0.01-10 micromol/L) significantly inhibited the contractions. Electrical field stimulation (2-60 Hz) caused frequency-dependent contractions in human detrusor smooth muscles, which were significantly inhibited by various drugs. In the presence of 1 micromol/L atropine, tolterodine and vamicamide did not inhibit the contractions induced by electrical field stimulation at all frequencies, while temiverine (10 micromol/L) significantly inhibited the contractions.; Tolterodine and vamicamide inhibited contractions of human detrusor smooth muscles only through their antimuscarinic action, while temiverine had both antimuscarinic and calcium-antagonist actions.

The number and types of treatments were evaluated with respect to baseline factors such as prior diagnosis of IC and symptom severity.; One hundred five (18%) women were receiving no therapy at baseline. Single-mode therapy was reported by 195 (34%) women, and a combination of two treatments was reported by 119 (21%) women. Three or more treatments were reported in 162 (28%) women. A total of 183 different types of therapies were recorded. The five most commonly used therapies for IC symptoms were cystoscopy and hydrodistention, amitriptyline, phenazopyridine, special diet, and intravesical heparin. Because most patients entered the ICDB before the approval of oral pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS), only 6% of women reported oral PPS use at baseline. There were statistically significant associations between the number and types of treatments and clinical center, a prior diagnosis of IC, and symptom severity.; The diversity of IC therapies underscores the lack of understanding about the treatment of this syndrome. Further research in IC is essential to develop and to evaluate rational therapies and treatment algorithms. These algorithms should be ""evidence based"" and should be revised as the underlying etiology and pathophysiology of IC is delineated.",E,E

Improvements in drug delivery systems have altered drug bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. Active current investigation in new agents and delivery systems for intravesical delivery has yielded intriguing early results that may substantially add to the armamentarium for the management of the overactive bladder (urgency, frequency, urge incontinence). New developments in the understanding of the neuropharmacology of the bladder, peripheral pelvic nerves, and sacral cord may provide agents with entirely new drug effects, either as primary agents or agents to be used in combination with currently available drugs.

11116281,Pharmacological agents for the treatment of urinary incontinence due to overactive bladder.,Cholinergic Antagonists; Humans; Serotonin Antagonists; Urinary Bladder; Urinary Bladder Diseases; Urinary Incontinence,"Wein, A J","Although the exact aetiology of overactive bladder is unknown to date, pharmacological therapy has been targeted to both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Potential CNS targets include GABA, opioid, serotonin (5-HT), dopamine and glutaminergic receptors as well as the alpha-adrenoceptors. Potential PNS targets include muscarinic receptors, calcium and potassium channels and alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Since acetylcholine is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter involved in bladder (detrusor) contraction and emptying, anticholinergic agents are the primary compounds used clinically to decrease involuntary detrusor contractions. Anticholinergic therapy has a stabilising effect on the bladder (detrusor muscle); increases bladder capacity; decreases frequency of involuntary detrusor contractions; and delays the initial urge to void, but does not affect warning time. However, the clinical utility of antimuscarinic therapy is limited by the lack of receptor selectivity, resulting in the classic anticholinergic side effects of dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation and potentially, CNS effects such as somnolence and impaired cognitive function. These unwanted side effects often result in premature discontinuation of therapy and poor compliance. Previous attempts to develop uroselective alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists have not been successful and although research continues, the hope that this class of agents would be viable alternatives to the anticholinergics remains to be proven in the clinical setting. The recent demise of several potassium channel openers does not augur well for the future of this class of agent. The reasons for the discontinuation of trials with these agents have not been fully elucidated, but one must assume that they were not uroselective and the cardiovascular side effects rendered them less than useful clinically. The serotonin re-uptake inhibitors appear to be promising novel therapeutic agents aimed at controlling bladder over-activity through specific CNS pathways. The sensory side of the micturition reflex is a potential therapeutic target. Agents to desensitise afferent nerve endings involved in C-fibre afferent reflexes include capsaicin and resiniferatoxin. Their clinical applicability is currently being evaluated. Finally, the recent findings related to the role of the P2X3 receptor in the sensory aspects of bladder filling have created new interest in the future development of agents that will improve the management of this prevalent and debilitating condition.",E,E

The treatment of UUI in the elderly population is complicated by comorbidities, polypharmacy, cost, and side effects. The purpose of this study was to examine our practice pattern in Middle Tennessee for the treatment of elderly women with UUI.; We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all women over age 65 seen at our institution between January 1, 1998 and September 1, 1999 with an initial complaint of pure UUI. Diagnosis was based on history and physical examination by a single urologist (JJF). Initial treatment in all patients was medication as well as timed and double voids. Medication chosen was based on cost factors, co-morbidities, current medications, and outcome from previous treatment.; Of 53 women ranging in age from 65-87 years of age (avg. 74.7) included in this study, 6/53 (11.3%) had a previous CVA, and 2/53 (3.7%) had grade I-II cystoceles. Initial pharmacologic treatment included anticholinergic medication in 47 patients (88.6%), and either imipramine or topical estrogen alone in the remaining 11.4%. Of the anticholinergics, hyoscyamine time capsules were used in 29, tolterodine in 7, standard oxybutynin in 5, oxybutynin XL in 1, and a combination with imipramine in 5. Thirty-four of the 53 total patients (64.1%) discontinued their medications because of no improvement 14 (41.1%), dry mouth 9 (26.4%), other side effects 9 (26.4%), cost 1, and other reasons in the remaining 2 patients. Only 17 patients (32%) stated they were doing well on their initial medications; 11 of those (64.7%) were taking hyoscyamine time capsules. Upon subjective failure, 22/36 patients (61.1%) had their medications changed, while 14/36 (38.8%) pursued behavioral therapy without additional medications. Urodynamic studies were done in 12 patients who failed empiric medical treatment (22.6%).; Only 32% of elderly women treated medically for UUI were satisfied and continued therapy in this patient population. One-fourth of elderly women failed empiric medical management of UUI due to lack of efficacy, and one-third due to intolerable side effects. In this practice, hyoscyamine was continued more often than any other anticholinergic because of reasonable cost, efficacy, and side effect profile.",I,8

A comparison of cure rates between biofeedback training and pelvic floor exercise groups demonstrated that there were significant differences in objective changes: detrusor pressure (68.75% vs. 0%, p < 0.001), compliance (75.0% vs. 6.67%, p < 0.001), and resting maximal urethral closure pressure (43.75% vs. 6.67%, p < 0.037). Neither the cure rate nor improvement rate of subjective changes (urgency, and frequency and episodes of urge incontinence), significantly differed.; Oxybutynin chloride was not well tolerated while bladder-sphincter-biofeedback was well accepted. As a secondary treatment, it appears better than pelvic floor exercise alone and may be the choice of non-surgical treatment in those women who failed to respond to oxybutynin chloride for detrusor instability.",E,E

Neonatal records were abstracted for mortality and short-term morbidity, including the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), intraventricular hemorrhage, chronic lung disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, periventricular leukomalacia, and retinopathy of prematurity. Survival was defined as discharge from neonatal intensive care.; Thirty-three singleton pregnancies met criteria for inclusion, 11 of whom survived to discharge (survival rate 0.33; 95% CI 0.18, 0.52).

The affinity of AH-9700 for sigma(1) receptors was significantly reduced in the presence of 5'-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (GppNHp). In isolated bladder strips of rats, AH-9700 inhibited carbachol-induced contractions. In anesthetized rats, i.v. administration of AH-9700 and typical sigma receptor ligands, (+)-pentazocine and 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG), but not oxybutynin, dose-dependently inhibited rhythmic isovolumetric reflex bladder contractions. AH-9700 and oxybutynin suppressed the amplitude of rhythmic bladder contractions. On the other hand, at doses lower than used i.v., the i.c.v. administration of AH-9700 or the sigma receptor ligands inhibited rhythmic bladder contractions without suppressing the amplitude. This inhibitory effect of AH-9700 was markedly reduced by pretreatment with i.c.v. pertussis toxin. These results suggest that AH-9700 exerts a marked anti-micturition reflex effect through central sigma receptors possibly related to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o-proteins and a moderate spasmolytic effect based on its peripheral anti-muscarinic activity.",E,E

The mean AUC and Cmax values for each of the four analytes in the fed treatment were within +/- 20% of the fasting treatment values. The 90% confidence intervals for the treatment ratios (fed/fasted) for log-transformed Cmax and AUCinf values for the drug isomers and AUCinf values for the metabolite isomers were all within the 80% to 125% range. Only the ranges for the Cmax values for R- and S-desethyloxybutynin were slightly wider but were well within the 70% to 143% criteria recommended for Cmax when comparing effect of food. Lack of effect of food on oxybutynin XL is consistent with the previous observation that the osmotically controlled formulations are nearly insensitive to the gastrointestinal environment, including food.

Adverse events were reported by 20 patients (six on 0.5 mg, five on 1 mg, and nine on 2 mg). Most adverse events were not considered to be drug-related; of the 13 possibly related events, 10 occurred in those taking 2 mg. Headache was the most commonly reported adverse event. No serious adverse events were reported and there were no general safety concerns. There was an improvement in voiding diary variables in all treatment groups after 2 weeks of treatment, although the efficacy was greatest in those taking 1 mg and 2 mg. Pharmacokinetic findings were consistent with dose linearity over the range 0.5-2 mg.; The results support the use of 1 mg twice daily as the optimal dose of tolterodine for treating children aged 5-10 years with an overactive bladder.",E,E

This article provides an update on the 'symptom' of urinary incontinence and reviews the concept of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The challenges facing health services researchers working in this field are also discussed in terms of trying to quantify the size and extent of the underlying problem. Economic issues and work undertaken to evaluate the cost of LUTS are appraised and the common nonsurgical treatments for LUTS are described together with associated conditions and their cost implications. The cost to individuals and society of LUTS is generally underestimated and the importance of reducing its severity (if cure is not achievable) makes clinical and economic sense.,E,E

Prior to the study, all volunteers were classified as either extensive or poor metabolisers by cytochrome P450 2D6 genotyping.; Volunteers received tolterodine ER 4mg once daily or tolterodine IR 2mg twice daily for 6 days (all doses given as the L-tartrate salt). A washout period of 7 days separated the 2 treatments. Serum concentrations of tolterodine, its active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (5-HM) and the active moiety (extensive metabolisers: sum of unbound tolterodine + 5-HM; poor metabolisers: unbound tolterodine) were measured for up to 48 hours post-dose on day 6 (steady state). Tolerability was also determined.; 17 volunteers (13 extensive metabolisers, 4 poor metabolisers) completed the study and were evaluable for both treatment periods. The 90% confidence interval for the geometric mean ratio of area under the serum concentration-time curve to 24 hours (AUC24) of the active moiety, for all volunteers combined, indicated equivalence for the 2 formulations. Pooled analysis also demonstrated that the peak serum concentration (Cmax) of the active moiety following administration of tolterodine ER was around 75% of that observed for the IR tablet, whereas the trough concentration was around 1.5-fold higher. Overall, the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine (irrespective of genotype) and 5-HM (extensive metabolisers only) were consistent with sustained drug release over 24 hours. Tolterodine ER was well tolerated.; The new once daily ER formulation of tolterodine 4mg shows pharmacokinetic equivalence (AUC24) to the existing IR tablet given at a dose of 2mg twice daily. Findings of lower Cmax for tolterodine ER may explain the significantly lower rate of dry mouth subsequently observed in patients with overactive bladder.",I,8

Results of randomised double-blind placebo-controlled studies indicate that tolterodine 4 mg/day (administered as immediate-release tablets 2mg twice daily or extended-release capsules 4mg daily) is superior to placebo in improving micturition diary variables in patients with overactive bladder. Moreover, tolterodine 2mg twice daily is as effective as oxybutynin 5mg 3 times daily. Maximum treatment effects with both drugs occurred after 5 to 8 weeks of treatment and improvements were maintained during long term treatment for up to 24 months. In a pooled analysis of four 12-week studies, equivalent and significant reductions in micturition frequency (-2.3 and -2.0 vs -1.4, p < 0.001) and the incidence of urge incontinence episodes (-1.6 and -1.8 vs -1.1, p < 0.05) were reported for tolterodine 2mg twice daily and oxybutynin 5mg 3 times daily compared with placebo. Functional bladder capacity was also significantly increased. Improvements in patient perceptions of their urgency symptoms and of problems caused by their bladder condition were significantly greater during treatment with tolterodine than with placebo. Tolterodine was generally well tolerated in clinical trials of up to 24 months' duration. Dry mouth was the most frequent adverse event. The incidence (40 vs 78%, p < 0.001) and intensity of this event was lower with tolterodine 2mg twice daily than oxybutynin 5mg 3 times daily. Additionally, a 23% lower incidence of dry mouth was reported with once daily extended-release tolterodine capsules than with twice daily immediate-release tablets (p < 0.02). The incidence of adverse CNS events with tolterodine was low and similar to that of placebo. Tolterodine was well tolerated in elderly patients and no serious tolerability concerns were identified.; Tolterodine is the first antimuscarinic agent to specifically developed for the treatment of overactive bladder. The functional selectivity of tolterodine for the bladder translates into good efficacy and tolerability in patients, including the elderly, with overactive bladder. Tolterodine is as effective as oxybutynin in improving micturition diary variables but is associated with a significantly lower incidence and intensity of dry mouth. This favourable tolerability profile, together with sustained clinical efficacy during long term treatment, places tolterodine as valuable treatment for the symptoms of overactive bladder.",E,E

The main outcome measures were changes in voiding diary variables combined with detailed tolerability-safety assessments.; Patients treated with tolterodine had significantly fewer adverse events (69% versus 81%, p = 0.01), notably dry mouth (37% versus 61%, p <0.0001), as well as a lower incidence of dose reduction (6% versus 25%, p <0.0001) than those in the oxybutynin group. Each agent had comparable efficacy for improving urinary symptoms. Tolterodine and oxybutynin caused a significant decrease (p = 0.0001) in the mean number of voids per 24 hours (-1.7 or -15% and -1.7 or -15%, respectively), urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours (-1.3 or -54% and -1.8 or -62%, respectively) and mean voided volume per void (33 ml. or 22% and 34 ml. or 23%) after 10 weeks of treatment.; Tolterodine is as effective as oxybutynin for improving the symptoms of overactive bladder but it has superior tolerability.

In all, 101 children (mean age 4.2 years, range 0.25-10) had unco-ordinated detrusor-sphincter function and low compliance; they were treated with either oral or intravesical oxybutynin and clean intermittent catheterization.; Of the 101 patients, 67 were treated with oral oxybutynin; in 11 the treatment was discontinued because of the side-effects. The other 34 patients used both clean intermittent catheterization and intravesical oxybutynin. In this group there were side-effects in six patients, including drowsiness, hallucinations and cognitive changes.; Oral and intravesical oxybutynin is effective for managing neurogenic bladder dysfunction, but intravesical administration is safer and better tolerated than oral oxybutynin in the treatment of children with MMC. However, adverse effects such as cognitive impairment can also occur in children treated with intravesical oxybutynin and these patients must be closely monitored because these effects may differ from those with oral administration.",E,E

This prediction is accomplished by incorporating in vitro release characteristics as an input function (A(vitro)) to a pharmacokinetics model. This simple approach often results in biased predictions of observed in vivo drug concentrations, and it can result in rejecting IVIVC. To solve this problem we propose a population IVIVC model that incorporates the in vitro information and allows one to quantify possibly changed in vivo release characteristic. The model assumes linear kinetics and describes the in vivo release as a sum of A(vitro) and a nonparametric function (A(d), a spline) representing the difference in release due to in vivo conditions. The function A(vitro) and its variability enter the model as a prior distribution. The function A(d) is estimated together with its intersubject variability. The number of parameters associated with A(d) defines the model: no parameters indicates perfect IVIVC, a large number of parameters indicates poor IVIVC. The number of parameters is determined using statistical model selection criteria. We demonstrate the approach to solve the IVIVC problem of an oral extended release oxybutynin form (OROS), administered in three pharmacokinetic studies. These studies present a particular challenging case; that is, the relative bioavailability for the OROS administration is >100% compared with that of the immediate-release form. The result of our modeling shows that the apparent lack of IVIVC can be overcome: in vivo concentration can be predicted (within or across data sets) based on in vitro release rate together with a simple form of systematic deviation from the in vitro release.",E,E

Tolterodine is a bladder-selective, antimuscarinic agent for the treatment of frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence that characterize overactive bladder. In a 9-month open-label study, the safety, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of tolterodine 2 mg twice daily was evaluated in 854 patients with overactive bladder symptoms who had completed one of four 12 week randomized, controlled trials of tolterodine. Safety and tolerability were assessed in terms of adverse events and clinical/laboratory variables. Efficacy was assessed using micturition diaries and patient perception of their bladder condition. In all, 70% of patients remained on treatment for 9 months. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event, occurring in 28% of patients (intensity: 19% mild, 7% moderate, 2% severe). A total of 9% of patients withdrew due to adverse events. Dosage reduction occurred in 13% of patients. Significant improvements (P < 0.0001) in micturitions per 24 h (-22%), urge incontinence episodes per 24 h (-76%) and volume voided per micturition (+22%) were observed after 9 months of treatment, with 65% of patients reporting an improvement in perception of their bladder problems. The incidence of adverse events and improvements in micturition diary variables during open-label treatment were comparable with those observed during a 12 week randomized treatment. It was concluded that tolterodine is well tolerated and maintains its clinical efficacy during 9 months of treatment. The high proportion of patients remaining on treatment indicates that tolterodine is an effective long-term treatment for overactive bladder.",I,I

Tolterodine is non-selective with respect to the muscarinic M1-M5 receptor subtypes, but has a greater effect on the bladder than on salivary glands in vivo, in both animals and humans.

They act by inhibiting binding of acetylcholine to the muscarinic receptors in the detrusor muscle of the bladder. The same types of muscarinic receptors are found in the salivary glands; thus anticholinergic agents may decrease saliva production and cause dry mouth, a commonly cited reason for discontinuation of therapy.; The primary objective of this study was to compare saliva output, which is an objective measure of dry mouth, in subjects taking immediate- or extended-release oxybutynin, tolterodine, or placebo.; This was a single-site, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, 4-treatment, 4-period crossover study. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment sequences that included extended-release oxybutynin 10 mg, tolterodine 2 mg, immediate-release oxybutynin 5 mg, and placebo. Saliva output was measured objectively before dosing with each treatment and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after dosing.; Thirty-six healthy adult volunteers (22 women and 14 men) participated in the study. They ranged in age from 19 to 42 years (mean, 27 years). Thirty-one were white, 3 Asian, and 2 black. There were no significant differences in predose saliva output between the 4 study groups. With placebo, saliva output increased throughout the day. Saliva output was maintained at predose levels throughout the day with extended-release oxybutynin. Two hours after dosing with tolterodine and immediate-release oxybutynin, saliva output decreased nearly 0.5 g in specimens collected over 2 minutes. All 3 active treatments were associated with lower saliva output compared with placebo. Extended-release oxybutynin and tolterodine were similar with respect to area under the saliva concentration-time curve but were associated with significantly greater saliva output than was immediate-release oxybutynin (P < 0.01). There were no serious adverse events (AEs) in this study. AEs were similar between treatments, although the incidence of headache was higher in the active-treatment groups than with placebo.; Objective assessment of saliva output in healthy adult volunteers indicated that extended-release oxybutynin and tolterodine had less impact on saliva output than did conventional immediate-release oxybutynin, suggesting that they may yield lower levels of dry mouth.",I,E

On the other hand, data regarding their influence on the central nervous system (CNS) are limited. This randomized, single-blind, parallel-group quantitative-topographical EEG (qEEG) study of clinical phase I investigates the potential CNS adverse effects of the three antimuscarinic drugs--tolterodine, oxybutynin, and trospium chloride--in comparison to placebo. Overall, 4 x 16 (total 64) young, healthy male volunteers were included in the study. The subjects were given either placebo or the clinically recommended daily doses of the drugs dispensed in three doses on a single day (tolterodine 2 mg bid and once placebo, total 4 mg/d; oxybutynin 5 mg tid, total 15 mg/d; and trospium chloride 15 mg tid, total 45 mg/d). The qEEG was recorded prior to and up to 4 hours after each intake of the trial medication (a total of 10 qEEG sessions) under three different conditions: at rest with eyes open, eyes closed, and under mental demand. The drug tolerability was subjectively evaluated by the volunteer and the investigator. In comparison to placebo (10% confidence interval), tolterodine and trospium chloride did not induce changes of the qEEG power in five of the six frequency bands (i.e., delta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, and beta 2). Isolated power decreases were only observed in the theta frequency band. In contrast, oxybutynin caused significant power reductions in four frequency bands (theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta 1; p < 0.01). The subjectively evaluated drug tolerability was comparable between all treatment groups, although differences in the AE occurrence existed, with the AE frequency being higher in the oxybutynin group. The results of this study support the findings that oxybutynin as a tertiary amine crosses the blood-brain barrier, causing significant qEEG activity changes and more pronounced central adverse effects. Although tolterodine is also a tertiary amine, it shows limited effects on qEEG activity (i.e., slight theta power reductions), comparable to the effects of trospium chloride, a quarternary amine, which barely crosses the blood-brain barrier. The minimal qEEG changes observed with tolterodine and trospium chloride reflect most probably a rebound message from the peripheral target organs. Prescription of oxybutynin thus implicates a higher risk of CNS side effects.",E,E

Blood samples were collected for 108 h after application of the transdermal system and for 6 h after oral administration. Plasma concentrations of the R- and S-enantiomers of OXY and DEO were assayed by LC-MS/MS. Enantiomer in vitro skin flux was evaluated using human cadaver skin.; In vitro skin flux studies demonstrated equal absorption of R and S- OXY. Plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of the R-enantiomers of OXY and DEO were slightly lower than the S-enantiomers following transdermal OXY. The relative AUC values were S-OXY>S-DEO>R-OXY>R-DEO. The AUC ratios of DEO/ OXY were less than 1 for both the R- and S- enantiomers. Following oral dosing, plasma DEO concentrations greatly exceeded OXY resulting in relative AUC values of R-DEO>S-DEO>S-OXY>R-OXY. The mean AUC ratios of S- and R-DEO/OXY were 3.25 and 8.93, respectively.; Stereoselective metabolism of OXY was evident following both transdermal and oral administration of OXY. The reduced pre-systemic metabolism of transdermally administered OXY compared to oral administration resulted in not only significantly lower DEO plasma concentrations, but also a different metabolite pattern. The differences between R-OXY and R-DEO following the two routes of administration support the potential for comparable clinical efficacy and reduced anticholinergic side-effects with transdermal treatment.",E,E

The present study was performed to evaluate the effect of a combined treatment of tricyclic antidepressant and an anticholinergic agent. Twenty-two children aged 6-12 years with primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis who did not prefer to use a conditioning alarm were given a combined treatment of these drugs. After a control period of 1 month, each patient was treated for 6 months and then observed for 3 months. A 30-mg dose of amitriptyline or imipramine was given with either 2-4 mg oxybutinin or 10-20 mg propiverine.

We identified some uncommon events as possible adverse drug reactions--notably hallucinations, tachycardia and palpitations. The prevalence of these events was compared with that in patient cohorts for other drugs on the PEM database. The age- and sex-adjusted relative risk of hallucinations on tolterodine compared with 10 drugs of other therapeutic classes, and with terodiline, another drug indicated for bladder instability, was 4.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.72 to 8.66] and 1.25 (95% CI 0.62 to 2.53), respectively.

For many, incontinence severely restricts their routine activities and damages their quality of life and self-esteem. In about one-third of women sufferers, and around a half of all men with incontinence, the cause is detrusor instability. This condition is characterised by involuntary bladder contractions or pressure rises during bladder filling, which result in a strong or uncontrollable urge to pass urine and, often, incontinence.

We tested Parkinson's disease (PD) patients in a task that measures reflexive orienting of spatial attention. Seven patients with idiopathic PD and eight control subjects performed a covert orienting task where spatial attention was directed by means of exogenous cues (luminance increments) with no predictive validity for target position. The subjects' task was to make a speeded saccade to a visual target, which appeared a variable time after onset of the cue either in the cued or an uncued spatial position. There was no overall difference between PD patients and control subjects in terms of the initial facilitation following reflexive cues, and later inhibition of return (IOR). However, PD patients differed from control subjects in two important respects. First, they were significantly faster than were control subjects on this reflexive visual-orienting task. Second, disease severity correlated with attentional performance; more advanced patients showed less initial facilitation but greater IOR. Thus PD patients show better performance on a reflexive saccade task and, for more advanced patients, greater IOR than control subjects. These findings are consistent with the possibility that reflexive attentional processes in PD patients may be more active.",E,E

Children with voiding dysfunction and vesicoureteral reflux historically have a high breakthrough infection rate of 34% to 43%. Breakthrough infection represents significant morbidity and it is the most common indication for surgical intervention for vesicoureteral reflux. Voiding dysfunction is present in 79% of patients who proceed to reflux surgery. We evaluated the impact of pelvic floor muscle retraining combined with a medical program in patients with voiding dysfunction and vesicoureteral reflux.; Children with a history consistent with voiding dysfunction and vesicoureteral reflux were screened by uroflowmetry/electromyography, bladder scan for post-void residual urine, renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography. Confirmed cases of voiding dysfunction and vesicoureteral reflux were prospectively enrolled in this study. Children participated in an interactive, computer assisted, pelvic floor muscle retraining program that involved a conservative medical regimen and pelvic floor muscle retraining. All patients received prophylactic antibiotics. We evaluated the rate of breakthrough urinary tract infection, reflux outcome and surgical intervention. A literature review with the key words vesicoureteral reflux, voiding dysfunction and urinary tract infection was performed to identify historical control cases for comparison.; Study enrollment criteria were fulfilled by 49 girls and 4 boys 4 to 13 years old (average age 8.8), representing 72 units with low grades I to II (48) and high grades III to V (24) reflux. Mean followup was 24 months. Initial uroflowmetry/electromyography and bladder scan revealed a staccato flow pattern and normal post-void residual urine in 11% of cases, staccato flow pattern and elevated post-void residual urine in 10%, flattened flow pattern and normal post-void residual urine in 28%, and flattened flow pattern and elevated post-void residual urine in 51%. Breakthrough infection developed in 5 patients (10%), including 1 in whom reflux had resolved and 1 with grade I reflux who underwent observation. The parents of 2 patients elected to complete biofeedback without surgical intervention and these patients did not have a repeat infection. Reimplantation was performed in 1 case (2%). There was resolution in 18 low and 7 high grade refluxing units, including 2 older patients with a long history of high grade bilateral disease. Average time to resolution was 7.8 months. We noted elevated post-void residual urine in 88% of the patients with high grade reflux. Average age at resolution was 9.2 years. During a 24-month period one of us (P. H. M.) noted a greater than 90% decrease in surgical intervention.; A combined conservative medical and computer game assisted pelvic floor muscle retraining program appears to have decreased the incidence of breakthrough urinary tract infections and facilitated reflux resolution in children with voiding dysfunction and vesicoureteral reflux. Patients with high grade reflux and voiding dysfunction commonly present with elevated post-void residual urine, contraindicating the indiscriminate administration of anticholinergics. Decreasing the rate of urinary tract infections may have a dramatic impact on the need for surgical intervention and enable the reflux resolution rate to approximate that in patients without voiding dysfunction. Prospective controlled trials are needed to determine whether pelvic floor muscle retraining combined with a conservative medical regimen alters the natural history of vesicoureteral reflux in patients with voiding dysfunction.",E,E

The proposed mechanism of action is the induction of GA-specific T cells characterized by protective anti-inflammatory Th2 response. We tested this hypothesis in 11 MS patients treated with GA from 1-19 months. Interferon-gamma and IL-5 (markers of Th1 and Th2 responses respectively) were assayed by ELISA in GA-specific T-cell lines (TCL) supernatants. Th1/Th2 bias was defined based on the ratio of IFN-gamma/IL-5 secretion. Fifty-eight pre-treatment and 75 on-treatment GA-specific TCL were generated. On-treatment mean IL-5 levels in GA-TCL increased significantly, whereas those for IFN-gamma were markedly reduced. Consequently, the ratio of IFN-gamma IL-5 also shifted in favor of a Th2 response. The percentage of GA-TCL classified as Th1 was decreased, whereas those classified as Th2 increased on-treatment as compared to pre-treatment. Some GA-specific TCL, (approximately 25%) generated during treatment secreted predominantly IL-5 in response to MBP and the immunodominant MBP peptide 83-99, indicating that these crossreactive antigens can act as partial agonists for GA-reactive TCL. These results strongly suggest that the mechanism of action of GA in MS involves the induction of crossreactive GA-specific T cells with a predominant Th2 cytokine profile.",E,E

Ditropan XL [(Oxy-XL), a controlled-release formulation of oxybutynin chloride, is a once-daily oral dosage form that incorporates the OROS technology. Dry mouth as the pharmacodynamic measure was compared between Oxy-XL and IR-Oxy administration. The steady state stereospecific pharmacokinetics were also established for the two formulations and the kinetic-dynamic relationship of oxybutynin was examined.; This was a randomized, repeated-dose, double-blind, two-treatment, two-period, crossover study. After a baseline assessment day, volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences and received 4 days of each treatment with a washout period of 7 days between treatments. The treatments were: 1) Oxy-XL 10 mg in the morning and placebo 8 h later, and 2) IR-Oxy 5 mg in the morning and again 8 h later. Volunteers assessed dry mouth severity subjectively using a 100 mm visual analogue scale, VAS (Baseline, treatment days 1 and 4) and objectively by collecting saliva (Baseline and treatment day 4) before dosing and every hour after the morning dose for approximately 16 h. Several blood samples were collected during each treatment, with frequent sampling on day 4 to analyse for plasma R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin concentrations.; Relatively constant plasma concentrations of oxybutynin and its metabolite were seen over 24 h following Oxy-XL administration with the degree of fluctuation being much lower (P = 0.001; 66% to 81% reduction for the various analytes) than IR-Oxy. Compared with IR-Oxy, Oxy-XL yielded higher (131% and 158% for the R- and S-isomer, respectively) oxybutynin and lower (62% and 78% for the R- and S-isomer, respectively) desethyloxybutynin bioavailability, suggesting reduced first-pass metabolism. Saliva output (area under the effect curve) was significantly higher [P = 0.001; 37% (95% confidence interval: 24, 51%)] with Oxy-XL than with IR-Oxy and, accordingly, dry mouth severity (VAS) integrated over the day was significantly lower with Oxy-XL. The decrease in saliva output and the consequent increase in dry mouth severity correlated with the metabolite R-desethyloxybutynin concentration, and no apparent relationship was observed with the R-oxybutynin concentration. This suggests that the metabolite may contribute to the dry mouth. Therefore, the reduction in metabolite exposure with Oxy-XL may be a possible explanation for the observed decrease in dry mouth severity with OXY-XL compared with IR-Oxy.; Oxy-XL maintains relatively constant plasma drug and metabolite concentrations and minimizes first-pass metabolism of oxybutynin. The metabolite appears to contribute to dry mouth associated with oxybutynin, and following Oxy-XL metabolite exposure is reduced compared with IR-Oxy. Consequently less dry mouth was observed with Oxy-XL as compared with IR-Oxy.",I,8

The elapsed time to first voiding, pain, and straining was observed in group I and the groups were compared regarding time of catheter removal, accidental removal of catheter/stent, hospital stay, and complications.; All stented patients strained at first voiding. Nineteen showed pain, and only 5 voided in the first 8 hours. The catheterized group had no such problems. Time of catheter/stent removal and hospital stay were similar. Three stents were dislodged in patients with significant straining. Meatal stricture was noticed in 5 and 3 patients and fistula in 5 and 2 patients of group I and II, respectively. Complications were significant in patients whose stents were removed accidentally.; Stenting led to significant patient irritability with voiding problems.

However, 53% (27) of 51 events classified as serious adverse drug reactions were reported. Overall, serious events were five times more likely to be reported to the CSM than non-serious events. Our results should not be extrapolated to calculate incidence rates of adverse drug reactions in the community from spontaneous reports.",E,E

They were asked to imagine a finger opposition movement performed with their right hand, externally paced at a rate of 1 Hz. Trials alternating between motor imagery and rest were measured. A pilot study of three age-matched controls was also performed. We chose the task as a robust method of activating the supplementary motor area (SMA), defects of which have been reported in PD. The PD patients showed normal degrees of activation of the SMA (proper) when both ""off"" and ""on."" Significant activation with imagining movement also occurred in the ipsilateral inferior parietal cortex (both ""off"" and when ""on"") and ipsilateral premotor cortex (when ""off"" only). The patients showed significantly greater activation of the rostral anterior cingulate and significantly less activation of the left lingual gyrus and precuneus when performing the task ""on"" compared with their performance when ""off."" PD patients when imagining movement and ""off"" showed less activation of several sites including the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when compared to the controls performing the same task. No significant differences from controls were present when the patients imagined when ""on."" Our results are consistent with other studies showing deficits of pre-SMA function in PD with preserved function of the SMA proper. In addition to the areas of reduced activation (anterior cingulate, DLPFC), there were also sites of activation (ipsilateral premotor and inferior parietal cortex) previously reported as locations of compensatory overactivity for PD patients performing similar tasks. Both failure of activation and compensatory changes are likely to contribute to the motor deficit in PD.",E,E

It is important, therefore, to consider non-compliance in economic evaluations. A review of pharmacoeconomic evaluations, which have applied sensitivity analysis to non-compliance rates, was undertaken to evaluate the impact of non-compliance on the cost-effectiveness of different drug therapies. Although 22 evaluations satisfied the inclusion criteria, additional information was obtained from the authors of most studies, as the published details were inadequate. The majority of evaluations assumed altered effectiveness owing to reduced compliance in the absence of supportive clinical evidence. Because of the disparity in the nature of the outcomes, the measures of non-compliance and the time horizon of the studies evaluated, it was not possible to compare the magnitude of the impact of non-compliance among different drug-disease combinations. However, it was evident that non-compliance always results in a reduction in efficacy, but its impact on costs varied substantially. The importance of incorporating measures of compliance is highlighted, as failing to account for 'real world' compliance rates in pharmacoeconomic evaluations may lead to selection of sub-optimal treatment strategies.",E,E
11760777,Which muscarinic receptor is important in the bladder?,"Humans; Muscarinic Antagonists; Receptors, Muscarinic; Urinary Bladder; Urinary Incontinence","Yamanishi, T; Chapple, C R; Chess-Williams, R","Antimuscarinic agents are the most widely used therapy for urge incontinence, but have side effects such as constipation, tachycardia and dry mouth, resulting from a lack of selectivity for the bladder. M2 receptors are the predominant cholinoceptors present in urinary bladder, but mainly the minor population of M3 receptors mediate its contraction. M2 receptors modulate detrusor contraction by several mechanisms, and may contribute more to contraction of the bladder in pathological states such as bladder denervation or spinal cord injury. Prejunctional inhibitory M2 or M4 receptors and prejunctional facilitatory muscarinic Ml receptors in the bladder have all been reported. In clinical studies, tolterodine, a non-selective muscarinic antagonist, has been reported to be as effective as oxybutynin but inducing less dry mouth. Thus, although it is not certain which antimuscarinic drugs have the better efficacy and tolerability, the non-selective antimuscarinic drugs seem to be better than M3-selective antagonists in their clinical efficacies. However, controlled release, or intravesical, intravaginal, or rectal administrations of oxybutynin have been reported to cause fewer side effects. Darifenacin, a new M3 selective antagonist, has been reported to have selectivity for the bladder over the salivary gland in vivo. To verify which antimuscarinic drugs selective for the muscarinic subtypes have the best efficacy and tolerability, comparative clinical trials between M3 selective antagonists and non-selective compounds, such as olterodine, are required in the future.",E,E

This substance and its major metabolite DD01 exhibit a favourable effect-to-side-effect ratio for the bladder. Several clinical studies demonstrated the drug's efficacy in reducing the symptoms of an overactive bladder (urgency, urge incontinence and high micturition frequency) and in increasing functional bladder volume. With a clinical effectiveness comparable to oxybutynin, the side effect-profile measures up favourably to oxybutynin. Consequently, though some limitations need to be addressed, tolterodine can be regarded as the drug of first choice to treat overactive bladders in a variety of patient groups: the young (and otherwise healthy), the elderly, as well as in patients with renal and hepatic insufficiency.

Given the prevalence pattern of overactive bladder and the widespread use of oral contraception, circumstances are likely to arise in which physicians may wish to prescribe tolterodine for patients already taking oral contraceptives. Based on a search of MEDLINE from 1990 to 2001, there have been no studies of whether concomitant use of these agents entails a risk of drug-drug interaction or conception.; This study investigated the effects of tolterodine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a low-dose combination oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 microg/levonorgestrel 150 microg).; This was an open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study in healthy women. Oral contraception was given for 21 days either alone or in combination with oral tolterodine 2 mg BID (on days 1-14) over two 28-day contraceptive cycles. Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed on day 14 based on plasma levels of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel up to 24 hours after dosing and serum tolterodine levels at 1 to 3 hours after dosing. The potential for pharmacodynamic interaction was assessed in terms of the risk of failure of suppression of ovulation based on serum levels of estradiol and progesterone measured throughout each cycle.; Twenty-four healthy women (age, 23-41 years [mean, 30 years]; height, 155-178 cm [mean, 167 cm]; body weight, 51-75 kg [mean, 64 kg]) participated in the study. There was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between tolterodine and the steroid hormones in the oral contraceptive used, nor did the oral contraceptive show any relevant pharmacokinetic interaction with tolterodine. Serum levels of estradiol and progesterone indicated suppression of ovulation in both treatment periods.; In this selected population. coadministration of tolterodine did not affect the contraceptive efficacy of a low-dose combination oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel.",I,8

We developed a 1-year Markov model (4-week cycle length) with transitions between disease states of normal, mild, moderate, and severe. Transition probabilities over 12 weeks were obtained from randomized trial data, and drug discontinuation rates were obtained from Quebec prescription claims data. Outcome measures were time in ""normal"" health state and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using EuroQol-5D utility scores from a survey of Swedish patients with overactive bladder. Costs to the health care payer and patient out-of-pocket costs (in Canadian dollars) were included.; For patients who discontinue oxybutynin, the use of tolterodine is associated with approximately 6 months per year in a normal health or mild disease state, compared with approximately 3 months for those who do not receive further drug therapy after discontinuation. Tolterodine use resulted in an annual additional cost per patient of Can $163.

Tolterodine (Detrol in North America and Detrusitol in the rest of the world, Pharmacia), a competitive muscarinic antagonist, is the first agent of this class to be specifically developed for the treatment of OAB. This agent displays in vivo functional selectivity for the bladder over other tissues that contain muscarinic receptors (e.g., salivary glands, eye), which translates into good efficacy and tolerability in patients with OAB (including the elderly). Comparative, randomised, double-blind studies show that tolterodine (administered as immediate-release [IR] tablets 2 mg b.i.d.) is as effective as oxybutynin (5 mg t.i.d.) in improving all of the troublesome symptoms of OAB but with a significantly lower incidence and severity of dry mouth. The advent of a new extended-release (ER) capsule formulation of tolterodine (4 mg) for convenient once-daily treatment builds upon these findings, with significantly improved efficacy for reducing urge incontinence episodes and a lower frequency of dry mouth relative to the existing IR tablet (2 mg b.i.d.).

Oxybutynin metabolism occurs primarily in the proximal gastrointestinal tract and the hepatic circulation and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme. The major degradation products are desethyloxybutynin, which possesses pharmacological activity, and phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is metabolically inert. A major limitation to long-term compliance with immediate-release oxybutynin remains the necessity for twice- or thrice-daily dosing regimens to provide sustained pharmacological efficacy. Side effects induced by cytochrome P450 metabolism of oxybutynin into the primary metabolite desethyloxybutynin within the gut wall substantially affect the tolerability of the compound within the individual. The oral osmotic delivery system provides unique advantages for drug delivery and substantially alters the tolerability profile of the oxybutynin chloride compound. This extended-release formulation consists of a two component core encapsulated by a semi-permeable membrane. The osmotic gradient between the surrounding environment and the inner core of the delivery system remains constant and water absorption within the capsule is controlled by the semipermeable membrane causing a controlled release of drug, which is sustained over 24 h. Herein are reviewed the various pre- and post-approval trials which have documented the overall therapeutic index of the oral osmotic oxybutynin (Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals).

This is usually defined by the triad of fever, cutaneous reaction, and involvement of internal organs, mainly affecting the liver. The close temporal relationship between the start of tolterodine therapy and the first symptoms and the reversibility after dechallenge led us to conclude that the adverse reaction was possibly related to tolterodine exposure.; Our case illustrates that tolterodine may rarely be associated with liver injury.

It is well documented that the immediate-release (IR) formulations of these agents have equivalent efficacy in relieving OAB symptoms. However, tolterodine demonstrates a more favorable tolerability profile, particularly in terms of the frequency and severity of dry mouth. Due to the development of novel drug delivery systems, extended-release (ER) formulations of both oxybutynin and tolterodine are now available, permitting once-daily dosing. The convenience of once-daily dosing of antimuscarinic agents would be expected to improve patient compliance and further relieve the symptoms of OAB. Clinical studies with the ER formulations of tolterodine and oxybutynin demonstrate potential clinical advantages over their respective IR forms in terms of either efficacy or tolerability or both, although the therapeutic index of tolterodine ER appears to show a greater advantage over its IR counterpart compared with oxybutynin ER and its IR form.

Voiding parameters were assessed for 12 hours post-dose, along with visual accommodation (near point of vision) at regular intervals.; A dose-dependent increase in maximum bladder capacity was observed for oxybutynin [2.5 mg (+35%), 5 mg (+45%) and 7.5 mg (%)]. The effect of tolterodine 5 mg on bladder capacity was approximately twice (+93%) that seen after oxybutynin 5 mg and the onset of the effect was more rapid with tolterodine. Effects on visual accommodation were also dose-dependent for oxybutynin (maximum changes in near point of vision were 13%, 20% and 29%, respectively). The maximum change observed after tolterodine 5 mg was the same as after oxybutynin 5 mg (i.e. 20%).; Tolterodine seems to exhibit selectivity for the bladder over the eye. Therefore, these results suggest that the normal dosage of tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) may have less effect on visual accommodation than the equivalent dosage of oxybutynin (5 mg three times daily) in patients with an overactive bladder.",E,E

At surgery, the patients had a poorly compliant bladder with a mean leak point volume (LPV) of 94 mL and a mean leak point pressure (LPP) of 58 cmH2O. None of the patients had vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) at BA; five with grade III or IV VUR had undergone endoscopic correction in a day-surgery procedure using a suburethral collagen injection 1-3 weeks before BA. The patients were evaluated using clinical, urodynamic, radiological and endoscopic assessments. The LPV, LPP and safe bladder capacity (SBC, the cystometric volume at an intravesical pressure of 40 cmH2O) were recorded.; At 1 year after surgery the mean LPV was 297 mL; none of the patients had VUR. The most recent mean LPV was 198 mL and the SBC 167 mL. The mean LPP remained stable at 60 cmH2O. At the last follow-up four patients had recurrent uni- or bilateral grade III-V VUR. At endoscopy the 'augmented' bladder portion had a smooth surface, compared with the grossly trabeculated lower half. From this finding all patients on clean intermittent catheterization were treated with oral oxybutynin. Some patients reported slightly less abdominal pain at maximum bladder volume; four needed pads to treat intermittent incontinence. On voiding cysto-urethrography, one patient had an hourglass-shaped bladder. Five patients recently underwent ileocystoplasty because of recurrent urinary tract infection, high-grade VUR and incontinence.; These results do not justify the routine use of BA in hypertonic/poorly compliant bladders secondary to myelomeningocele. The mean follow-up of 6.6 years showed that this procedure failed in seven of 11 patients. Further studies might be able to identify subgroups in which this approach may be more appropriate.",E,E

Two-week bladder diaries were used before and after treatment to document episodes of incontinence and voiding frequency.; Bladder capacity increased by 68.9 mL in the oxybutynin group (P <.001) and 17.3 mL in the behavior group and decreased 6.0 mL in the control group. SDV increased 69.9 mL in the oxybutynin group (P <.001), 40.5 in the behavior group (P <.05), and 7.8 mL in the control group.

Formal epidemiological studies of the safety of these medications in typical patient populations are lacking, particularly studies of serious events. We sought to determine whether the use of urinary antispasmodics increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias or sudden death.; Retrospective cohort study.; Retrospective analysis of data of participants in community, hospital or nursing home setting.; Fourteen thousand six hundred thirty-eight subjects with a diagnosis of urinary incontinence made between January 1, 1991, and June 30, 1995; all were aged 65 and older and enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid or the Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled programs of New Jersey.; Filled prescriptions for oxybutynin (Ditropan), flavoxate (Urispas), hyoscyamine (Cystospas), and hyoscyamine sulfate (Cystospas-M) were used to define days of exposure to these drugs. We also identified all use of nonsedating antihistamines and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, and their concurrent use, to serve as a positive control exposure. Two outcomes were then defined: a new diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmia combined with initiation of an antiarrhythmic medication and sudden death. Other covariates, including clinical, demographic, medication use, and healthcare utilization variables, were also assessed. Adjusted risk ratios of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death were derived from multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.; There was no significant association between periods of use of urinary antispasmodics and the development of ventricular arrhythmias (adjusted risk ratio (RR) = 1.23, 95 confidence interval (CI) = 0.87-1.75) or sudden death (adjusted RR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.28-1.74). A significantly increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia was observed for the positive control regimen, concurrent use of nonsedating antihistamines and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (adjusted RR = 5.47; 95% CI = 1.34-22.26), but not for use of either drug group alone. Concurrent use of nonsedating antihistamines and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors was also associated with a significant increase in the risk of sudden death (adjusted RR = 21.50, 95% CI = 5.23-88.37). Other variables significantly associated with ventricular arrhythmia included ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure, whereas nursing home use before the index date was associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of and treatment for ventricular arrhythmia. Other variables significantly associated with sudden death included male gender, black race, and congestive heart failure.; Antimuscarinic urinary antispasmodics available before 1996 were not associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death.

Reported prevalence rates of urge and mixed incontinence in the United States range from 3% to 8% and 5% to 37%, respectively, and the highest prevalence has been found in geriatric and psychogeriatric populations. Associated costs are substantial. Total costs of OAB in the United States were estimated to be $12.6 billion in 2000. Patients with OAB score lower than the general population in QOL assessments. All aspects of QOL can be compromised by OAB, as physical, social, occupational, domestic, and sexual activities are often limited in OAB patients. The pharmacist is instrumental in improving an individual's QOL through ensuring safe and effective treatment for OAB. Oxybutynin and tolterodine (Detrol-Pharmacia) have been the mainstays of pharmacotherapy for OAB, but frequent adverse effects (including dry mouth) often prevent patients from adhering to treatment. Tolterodine, now available in a new long-acting formulation, has been proven safe and efficacious in the treatment of OAB, with fewer adverse effects and better tolerability than existing agents.; Pharmacists can play an active role in helping identify and recommending interventions for OAB that can ultimately improve an individual's QOL.",E,E

It affects millions of people of all ages and both sexes world wide, with greater prevalence in women and the elderly. The treatment of OAB is aimed at reducing debilitating symptoms, which have a significant effect on all aspects of an individual's quality of life, including social, domestic, psychological, occupational, physical and sexual functioning. Anticholinergic agents are currently recommended as first-line therapy for OAB. Their use results in significant clinical improvement in patients, although a lack of selectivity for receptors in the bladder may lead to troublesome side effects, including dry mouth, blurred vision, somnolence, dizziness and constipation. Recent research efforts have focused on developing drugs with a reduced propensity for causing these problems. Of the available anticholinergic agents, oxybutynin and tolterodine are the most widely used to treat OAB. Studies directly comparing tolterodine immediate-release (IR) with oxybutynin IR have shown that the two agents have similar efficacy. However, tolterodine IR is significantly better tolerated, particularly with respect to the incidence and severity of dry mouth. An extended-release formulation of tolterodine (4 mg capsules) has recently been developed to allow for once-daily dosing. In addition to greater convenience, tolterodine extended-release has shown enhanced efficacy and tolerability compared with tolterodine IR.",E,E

Affinity estimates (pKB values) were calculated for the antagonists and correlated with values at the cloned muscarinic receptor subtypes quoted in the literature. 3 Pirenzepine, methoctramine and tropicamide drugs that have high affinities at M1, M2 and M4-receptors, respectively, all had low affinities on the human detrusor (pKB values of 6.8, 6.9 and 6.5, respectively), whilst the M3-selective antagonist 4-DAMP had a high affinity (9.5). Schild plots for all four antagonists had slopes of unity indicating an action at a single receptor. Oxybutynin and tolterodine also acted as competitive antagonists with affinity estimates of 7.6 and 8.1, respectively. 4 When the antagonist affinities obtained on the bladder were plotted against the values published for these antagonists at the cloned muscarinic receptor subtypes, the best correlations were obtained for the m3- and m5-muscarinic receptor subtypes. 5 These data suggest that direct contractile responses of the human detrusor muscle to muscarinic receptor stimulation in vitro are mediated solely via the M3-muscarinic receptor subtype with no contribution from the major M2-receptor population.",E,E

Of these, 3219 were home dwellers.; Prevalence of potentially inappropriate drugs and prevalence of drugs considered inappropriate related to 15 common medical conditions according to recommendations given by the expert panel in 1997.; The response rate was 78%. Of the respondents, 12.5%, 1.3%, and 0.2% were taking at least 1, 2, or 3 inappropriate drugs, respectively. The most prevalent inappropriate drugs were dipyridamole (3.6%), long-acting benzodiazepines (2.6%), amitriptyline hydrochloride (1.6%), ergot mesyloids (1.6%), muscle relaxants (1.2%), and meprobamate (1.1%). Use of medications considered inappropriate with certain medical conditions was higher: 27.2% of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were taking beta-blockers and 19.3% used sedatives. Of diabetic individuals taking oral hypoglycemics or insulin, 32.5% were taking a concomitant beta-blocker. Of those with a peripheral vascular disease, 37.9% were taking beta-blockers. However, two thirds of all these patient groups had concomitant coronary heart disease.; Compared with previous surveys, the use of inappropriate medications in our home-dwelling, elderly population is conspicuously low. In contrast, use of certain drugs considered inappropriate with different medical conditions was relatively high. However, the inappropriateness of the latter treatments may be questioned in individual patients.",E,E

Patients and methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted at two urogynaecology centres in Hong Kong. In all, 106 women with urodynamically confirmed detrusor instability were recruited. Baseline severity assessments included a visual analogue scale (VAS), urinary diary and urinary pad-test. The women were randomized to receive either oral tolterodine 2 mg or oxybutynin 5 mg twice daily for 10 weeks. Treatment responses were assessed at 4 and 10 weeks using the VAS and urinary diary. Treatment tolerability was assessed at baseline, 4 and 10 weeks using the Xerostomia Questionnaire. A urinary pad-test was repeated at 10 weeks. Results The perceived change from baseline VAS was better in the tolterodine than the oxybutynin group after 10 weeks of treatment (per-protocol analysis, P = 0.043). The two drugs were effective in reducing the symptoms of frequency (P < 0.001). Tolterodine was significantly better than oxybutynin in reducing urinary leakage (urinary pad-test; median change - 5.00 g vs 0 g, P = 0.019). Both drugs caused a significant worsening of dry mouth (overall dryness, P < 0.005; discomfort, P < 0.005; sleep, P = 0.021; speaking, P = 0.045; swallowing, P = 0.004; and liquid consumption, P = 0.017). Conclusions Both oxybutynin and tolterodine were effective in ameliorating the severity of the symptoms of detrusor instability. Tolterodine was better than oxybutynin in both subjective and objective outcome measures, but both drugs caused similar worsening of dry mouth that may limit the tolerability of these medications.",I,I

Excluding medications in which packaging, formulation, and potential adverse pharmacologic outcomes prohibited splitting, we performed a cost analysis of medications amenable to splitting.; Eleven medications amenable to pill splitting were identified based on potential cost savings and clinical appropriateness: clonazepam, doxazosin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, citalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, lisinopril, nefazadone, olanzapine, and sildenafil. For these medications, pill splitting is currently infrequent, accounting for annual savings of $6200 (or $0.03 per member per month), just 2% of the potential $259,500 (or $1.14 per member per month) that more comprehensive pill-splitting practices could save annually.; Pill splitting can be a cost-saving practice when implemented judiciously using drug- and patient-specific criteria aimed at clinical safety, although this strategy is used infrequently.",E,E

Although pharmacotherapy plays an indispensable role in the management of MS symptoms, optimal disease management requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines medication, rehabilitation, and patient education. Successful control of symptoms is critical to quality of life for MS patients. Immunomodulating drugs provide a means of controlling the underlying disease process, but they are not a cure. This places responsibility on health care providers to control a patient's MS-related symptoms to limit disability and delay impairment in the activities of daily living. Owing to the importance of symptom control, comprehensive patient evaluations should be performed at regular intervals to determine the extent of neurological damage and disease progression and to address changing patient needs. The goal of interventions should be not only to treat the primary and secondary symptoms of MS but also to provide access to the psychosocial support that will help MS patients and their families continue to cope as disease status changes.",E,E

One in two women suffers from a UTI at least once in her life. The young and sexually active are particulaly affected, but it is also seen in elderly, postmenopausal women. The likelihood of recurrence is high. Diagnosis is made with regard to typical complaints and the presence of leucocytes and nitrites in the urine. A culture is unnecessary in most cases. Uncomplicated UTI should be distinguished from complicated UTI, which has a risk of severe illness. The treatment of choice--short-term therapy with trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin--is successful in over 80% of the cases. Co-trimoxazol fluoroquinolones or cephalsporins are not considered first-choice drugs. There are indications that general practitioners' (GPs') management of UTI is not always optimal, specifically concerning diagnostic tests, the application of second-choice antibiotics, and the length of prescribed treatment courses. Many points relevant to GPs requirefurther research, such as epidemiology and resistance of urinary pathogens in the community and natural history of UTI, as well as optimal management in elderly or complicated patients and men.",E,E
12241127,A benefit-risk assessment of extended-release oxybutynin.,"Delayed-Action Preparations; Humans; Mandelic Acids; Parasympatholytics; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Assessment; Urinary Bladder, Neurogenic","Michel, Martin C","Oxybutynin is a muscarinic receptor antagonist, which has been available for a number of years in its original immediate-release (IR) formulation. While oxybutynin IR has proven effective for the treatment of overactive bladder, its extended use can be limited by adverse effects, particularly dry mouth. An extended-release (ER) formulation of oxybutynin based on the OROS system has recently become available, which allows once daily administration. In direct comparison to oxybutynin IR, oxybutynin ER has an increased oral bioavailability for the parent compound oxybutynin which is accompanied by a reduced bioavailability for the active metabolite N-desethyl-oxybutynin. The latter has been implicated in mediating a major part of the adverse effects of oxybutynin treatment. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised studies in patients with overactive bladder have demonstrated that oxybutynin ER has a similar efficacy as oxybutynin IR but with improved tolerability. This is in line with clinical pharmacological studies demonstrating a smaller impairment of saliva production with oxybutynin ER than with oxybutynin IR. Thus, the ER formulation of oxybutynin maintains the therapeutic benefits and concomitantly improves tolerability.",E,E

In an in vivo functional study, Compound A (0.03-10 mg/kg, i.v.) showed antimuscarinic activity with high selectivity for M(3) (salivation) over M(2) (bradycardia) (>100-fold). Darifenacin (0.01-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) showed only slight selectivity for M(3) over M(2) (3.7-fold). Methoctramine (0.003-1 mg/kg, i.v.) showed the reverse selectivity profile (0.077-fold). Tolterodine (0.003-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) showed less selectivity (1.2-fold). Compound A at M(3) inhibitory doses (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) showed inhibition in a distention-induced neurogenic bladder contraction model, and its maximal inhibitory effects were about 60% at an even higher dose (3 mg/kg). Methoctramine at M(2) inhibitory doses (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) did not significantly affect distention-induced bladder contraction. When tolterodine and darifenacin caused inhibition of distention-induced bladder contraction, its maximal inhibitory effects were similar to that of Compound A. Therefore, these findings suggest that Compound A would be an excellent pharmacological tool to give a better understanding of which subtypes of muscarinic receptors act in bladder function so far, and muscarinic M(3), but not M(2), receptors mainly mediate the cholinergic component of distention-induced bladder contraction.",E,E

Trials were categorized by type of drug and outcome variables.; Forty-seven trials were identified. Twenty-four, 12, and 11 trials evaluated anticholinergic drugs, drugs with anticholinergic and calcium antagonistic properties, and alternative regimens, respectively. Data regarding treatment effects of anticholinergic drugs are consistent with a high therapeutic efficacy and characteristic side effects. Therapeutic efficacy and side effect patterns of terodiline, an agent with anticholinergic and calcium antagonistic properties, were comparable to those of anticholinergic agents. Terodiline, however, has been withdrawn from the market because of its association with cardiac arrhythmia. Of the investigated alternative drug regimens, the papaverine-like smooth muscle relaxant flavoxate was reported to be ineffective. Studies investigating the dopamine agonist bromocryptine, the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin, or the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist baclofen showed subjective and/or objective improvement of symptoms without reaching statistical significance, whereas the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin, the neurotoxin capsaicin, and the prostaglandin synthase inhibitor flurbiprofen led to statistically significant subjective and/or objective improvement of symptoms. No data for subjective and/or objective improvement of symptoms could be extracted from the studies using the anticholinergic and calcium antagonistic agent propiverine and the calcium antagonist thiphenamil.; Published trials support anticholinergic drugs as efficacious therapy for urinary urge incontinence, with predictable side effects.

These bioavailability differences change the efficacy and tolerability of this drug class, which consistently enhances patient compliance and overall drug effect. In order for drug delivery to alter successfully the bioavailability of a specific agent, the metabolism of that agent and the effect of the degradatory pathway on drug-parent compound levels need to be established. This will enable researchers to design improved or altered delivery pathways to maximize the benefits of these agents. Intestinal metabolism is known to affect certain agents, specifically oxybutynin chloride. Therefore, delivery techniques have been designed that either substantially lower or totally bypass intestinal (presystemic) metabolism. These alternate paths include extended-release oral, cutaneous, intravesical, and intravaginal routes. In addition, improvements in drug delivery have also been found to influence positively efficacy and tolerability profiles associated with tolterodine tartrate, another anticholinergic agent. A long-acting oral formulation has been shown to increase drug efficacy while decreasing tolerability concerns and side effects such as xerostomia. These salubrious effects are, in part, due to the more stable serum-drug concentrations that are imparted by this long-acting formulation.",E,E

MACE with synchronous Mitrofanoff continent stoma creation was performed in one child with severe stenosis of the urethra. MACE with simultaneous bladder augmentation was used in 10 patients. 5 of them underwent colocystoplasty, 3 had ileocystoplasty and 2 ureterocystoplasty. Of these 10 children, three have additionally undergone the Mitrofanoff procedure. Patients' follow-up ranged from six months to two years. Three children had trouble with the MACE stoma because of its stenosis. One of them required revision of the stoma. All patients became clean and dry, and this operation improved not only their quality of life, but also their independence.",E,E
12469985,Female stress and urge incontinence in family practice: insight into the lower urinary tract.,Central Nervous System Diseases; Family Practice; Female; Humans; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Risk Factors; Urinary Incontinence; Urinary Tract; Urination,"Viktrup, L","As many as 25% of all women are affected by urinary incontinence, but only a few are treated. This frequent, often medically unrecognised, condition occurs in women of all ages. The continence mechanism is based on bladder detrusor control, intact anatomical structures in and around the urethra, correct positioning of the bladder neck and a comprehensive innervation of the lower urinary tract. Age and childbearing are established risk factors for the development of urinary incontinence, but other factors are currently suggested. The evaluation of urinary incontinence should include history, gynaecological examination, urine test, frequency-volume diary and a pad-weighing test. Female urinary incontinence can be treated in general practice by simple means, e.g. pelvic floor muscle training, bladder training, electrostimulation, drug therapy, or a combination of these approaches. This review updates the knowledge of the continence mechanism and summarises the epidemiology, risk factors, assessment and treatment of urinary incontinence in general practice.",E,E

They all had a maximal cystometric capacity less than the age-expected value. RCT was done by water loading and retention to the point of urgency once daily. During training, changes in bladder capacity were evaluated by voiding charts. If after 4 weeks of RCT, less than a 10% increase in bladder capacity was noted, oral oxybutynin was added.; The incidence of DOA was 66%. After 4 weeks of RCT, the bladder capacity increased in 20.6%. Combining RCT with oxybutynin led in the end to normalization of the bladder capacity in 79.4%. Older age and high-pressure DOA negatively influenced the ability to increase the bladder capacity. Fifteen children became completely dry, mainly by converting enuresis to nocturia.; Unsuccessful RCT is often caused by DOA, especially if a bladder capacity rise of at least 10% cannot be achieved within 4 weeks. If oxybutynin is added to the treatment, normalization of bladder capacity can be obtained in most. This increased bladder capacity cures enuresis only in a minority by sharpening their arousal and provoking nocturia.",E,E

These abnormalities can be identified during a comprehensive history and physical examination that focuses on voiding signs and symptoms. Urinary tract infection and constipation if present should be identified. Most girls with daytime wetting will respond to conservative therapy using timed voiding, dietary changes, and anticholinergic medication. Uroflowmetry with a postvoid residual urine measurement can identify girls who may benefit from biofeedback to treat pelvic floor dysfunction. Formal urodynamics and spinal magnetic resonance imaging should be done in girls refractory to treatment. Instruments and tools to quantify dysfunctional voiding symptoms are being developed. Because most dysfunctional voiding will be treated clinically, these validated tools will be useful in documenting severity of symptoms and clinical outcomes.",E,E

In the second patient, bilateral obstructed magaureters were used in tandem together with bladder neck division. Both patients had appendicovesicostomy according to Mitrofanoff.; In follow-up for over 5 years, both patients are continent with improved upper urinary tracts and normal or stable renal function. They are managed by clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) via the continent stoma with bladder capacities of 220 cc and 150 cc, respectively. Cystogram showed no vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). The procedures were considered to be successful although one patient was on oxybutinin because urodynamics showed high intravesical pressures.; Augmentation UCP should be considered in patients with bladder exstrophy when a suitable megaureter is available. This may be combined with simultaneous bladder neck reconstruction together with a continent diversion.",E,E

Findings of urodynamic studies and clinical features of patients with low compliance were compared with those of the normal compliant patients. Fourteen patients with low compliance received oral administration of oxybutynin and propiverine and intravesical instillation of oxybutynin to increase the compliance and capacity of the bladder, and follow-up urodynamic studies to monitor the change were undertaken.; Bladder compliance was decreased in 14 (28%) patients and normal in 36 (72%) patients. There was a significantly long time interval between the onset of injury and the initiation of rehabilitative treatment in the neurogenic bladder group with low compliance when compared to those of the normal compliance group (P < 0.05). Clean intermittent catheterization was used as the voiding method, significantly less than the normal compliance group (P < 0.05). ADC was observed in six out of fourteen patients with low compliance neurogenic bladder, but none in the normal compliance group. Upon the completion of conservative treatment, ADC disappeared in four patients whose compliance and capacity of the bladder were normalized on follow-up urodynamic studies.; ADC was only observed in the low compliant bladder and as ADC disappeared when compliance and capacity of the bladder was normalized; low compliance appeared to be the main cause of ADC. In addition, this study supports that the maintenance of compliance of the bladder may be the most important factor in the management of neurogenic bladder.",E,E

These adverse effects result from a lack of selectivity for the bladder over other organs. Although M2-muscarinic receptors are the predominant cholinoreceptor present in urinary bladder, the smaller population of M3-receptors appears to be the most functionally important and mediates direct contraction of the detrusor muscle. M2-receptors modulate detrusor contraction by several mechanisms and may contribute more to contraction of the bladder in pathologic states, such as bladder denervation or spinal cord injury. Prejunctional inhibitory M2-receptors or M4-receptors and prejunctional facilitatory M1-muscarinic receptors in the bladder have also been reported, but their relevance to the clinical effectiveness of muscarinic antagonists is unknown. In clinical studies, tolterodine, a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, has been reported to be equally effective to oxybutynin but to induce less dry mouth. Controlled-release and intravesical, intravaginal, and rectal administrations of oxybutynin have all been reported to cause fewer adverse effects. Conversely, darifenacin, a new M3-selective antagonist, has been reported to have selectivity for the bladder over the salivary gland in vivo. Whether M3-selective or nonselective muscarinic antagonists will be the most clinically effective for the overactive bladder-preserving the best balance between efficacy and tolerability-has yet to be established, and comparative clinical trials between compounds, such as darifenacin (M3 selective) and tolterodine (nonselective) will be required.",E,E

The proportion of women with a clinical diagnosis of urinary incontinence but with normal findings from urodynamic tests ranged from 3 to 8%. Overall sensitivity of urodynamic tests was about 85-90% in the diagnosis of urodynamic stress incontinence, but generally lower following diagnosis of urge and mixed incontinence. No relationship emerged between urodynamic test results and response to medical treatment.; This literature review shows that the sensitivity of clinical history versus urodynamic tests was 0.82, 0.69 and 0.51 respectively for stress, urge and mixed urinary incontinence. It also suggests that urodynamic diagnosis does not predict response to treatment. These data add to the ongoing 'urodynamics or no urodynamics' debate in the evaluation of urinary incontinence and show that urodynamic testing may not be helpful for patients receiving initial non-invasive therapy. These data are in line with the conclusions of the 1st and 2nd International Consultations on incontinence.",E,E

Interview topics included reasons for prescribing new drugs launched between January 1998 and May 1999; reasons for prescribing the new drug rather than alternatives; and sources of information used for each prescribed drug.; Important biomedical influences were the failure of current therapy and adverse effect profile. More influential than these, however, was the pharmaceutical representative. Hospital consultants and observation of hospital prescribing was cited next most frequently. Patient request for a drug, and patient convenience and acceptability were also likely to influence new drug uptake. Written information was of limited importance except for local guidelines. GPs were largely reactive and opportunistic recipients of new drug information, rarely reporting an active information search. The decision to initiate a new drug is heavily influenced by 'who says what', in particular the pharmaceutical industry, hospital consultants and patients. The decision to 'adopt' a new drug is clinched by subsequent personal clinical experience.; Prescribing of new drugs is not simply related to biomedical evaluation and critical appraisal but, more importantly, to the mode of exposure to pharmacological information and social influences on decision making. Viewed within this broad context, prescribing variation becomes more understandable. Findings have implications for the implementation of evidence-based medicine, which requires a multifaceted approach.",E,E

All had urge incontinence and were enrolled in a placebo controlled oxybutynin trial. Stop tests (voluntary interruption, mechanical interruption and continuous mechanical occlusion of flow) were performed on each subject.; At baseline the voluntary stop test measured lower mean isovolumetric detrusor pressure +/- SD than the mechanical and continuous methods (31.2 +/- 16.0 versus 47.2 +/- 26.5 and 48.7 +/- 24.4 cm. water, respectively). The latter 2 values also correlated highly (r = 0.87). Followup data on 76 women confirmed these results.

N-desethyloxybutynin (DEO), by a novel matrix transdermal system (TDS).; Two in vivo, randomized, three-way crossover trials examined single/multiple OXY TDS doses. Abdomen, buttock, and hip application sites were compared and dose proportionality was evaluated. Model independent pharmacokinetics, elimination rate constants, and metabolite/drug ratios were derived from both plasma OXY and DEO concentrations.; Single/multiple applications of the OXY TDS to the abdomen yielded mean Cmax OXY concentrations of 3.4 +/- 1.1/6.6 +/- 2.4 ng/mL and median tmax of 36/10 h, with steady state achieved during the second application. Plasma OXY and DEO concentrations decreased gradually after Cmax until system removal. Buttock and hip applications resulted in bioequivalent OXY absorption. AUC ratios of DEO/OXY were 1.5 +/- 0.4 (single dose) and 1.3 +/- 0.3 (multiple dose). Mean in vitro OXY skin absorption (186 microg/h) was comparable to the estimated in vivo delivery (163 microg/h) over 96 h.; Sustained delivery over 4 days and multiple sites allow a convenient, well-tolerated, twice-weekly OXY TDS dosing. A low incidence of anticholinergic side effects is expected during clinical use because of the avoidance of presystemic metabolism and low DEO plasma concentrations. The consistent delivery, absorption, and pharmacokinetics should result in an effective treatment of patients with overactive bladder.",E,E

Changes in voiding diary variables were evaluated after 2, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. The patients' perceptions of their bladder symptoms and tolerability (adverse events) were also determined.; In all, 501 patients (75% women) were evaluable on an intention-to-treat basis (244 on tolterodine + BT and 257 on tolterodine alone). Tolterodine significantly reduced the voiding frequency and increased the volume voided per void at all sample times; these effects were significantly increased by adding BT. At the end of the study the median percentage reduction in voiding frequency was greater with tolterodine + BT than with tolterodine alone (33% vs 25%, P < 0.001), while the median percentage increase in volume voided per void was 31% with tolterodine + BT and 20% with tolterodine alone (P < 0.001). There was a median of 81% fewer incontinence episodes than at baseline with tolterodine alone, which was not significantly different from that with tolterodine + BT (- 87%). The two groups had comparable median percentage reductions in urgency episodes. Some 76% of patients on tolterodine + BT reported an improvement in their bladder symptoms relative to baseline, compared with 71% on tolterodine alone. Tolterodine was well tolerated; the most common adverse event was mild dry mouth.; Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily is an effective and well tolerated treatment for an overactive bladder, the effectiveness of which can be augmented by a simplified BT regimen.",E,E

The complication of urethrocutaneous fistula in hypospadias surgery as a result of using this technique is also evaluated.; A retrospective review (July 1999 to September 2002) identified 180 pediatric patients who had undergone primary hypospadias surgery by a single surgeon. A modified technique of harvesting a vascularized dartos pedicle was incorporated in 111 hypospadias repairs. A ventral based vascularized dartos pedicle of tissue was used to cover a modified urethroplasty as described by Snodgrass.; The intraoperative meatal position before urethroplasty was subcoronal in 95 cases, penile/midshaft in 11 and penoscrotal in 5. The majority of patients (90 of 111) were younger than 12 months at surgery. Ages ranged from 5 months to 16 years (mean 21.1 months). Of the 111 patients reconstruction using the ventral based vascularized dartos pedicle to cover the urethroplasty was successful in 109 (98.2%), and at followup they have an acceptable cosmetic result with no evidence of urethrocutaneous fistula. In 1 patient with distal hypospadias a urethrocutaneous fistula developed, which was recognized 20 months postoperatively. Another patient with penoscrotal hypospadias had a proximal fistula at 6 months. There were no recognized intraoperative urethral injuries or complications. Followup ranged from 3 to 38 months (mean 19.1).; The ventral based vascularized dartos pedicle urethral coverage procedure is an easy and reliable technique to harvest adequate vascularized tissue to cover a hypospadias urethroplasty.

The medical approach is essentially pharmacological but the management of the nociceptive factors must not be neglected. In the mild urinary dysfunctions, bladder training can be advised. The pharmacological treatment aims at reducing the parasympathetic activity or at deafferenting the bladder. The antimuscarinic agents are an essential part of the treatment. Oxybutynin is the most widely used medication but recent agents like tolterodin have a better tolerability. Other drugs can also be used such as desmopressin, flavoxate. New molecules are under experiment (darifenacin). In case of troublesome side-effects or resistance to oral medications, local treatments are considered. Intravesical oxybutynin has been tried but has a short-lived efficacy. Intravesical instillation of capsaicine or resiniferatoxin blocks C-fibres afferents and leads to clinical and urodynamic improvement. Recently, injections of botulinum-A toxin in the detrusor have been advocated aiming at blocking the transmission of parasympathetic impulse. The first studies report encouraging results. All these local treatments resulting in bladder paresis are recommended for patients performing self-catheterization. Should these treatments fail, other therapeutic approaches are considered such as intrathecal treatment, neuromodulation, before deciding on neurosurgical or urosurgical procedures.",I,E

The mainstay of current pharmacological treatment involves use of muscarinic receptor antagonists, but their therapeutic efficacy is limited by their troublesome side effects resulting in the non-continuance of treatment in a significant number of patients. Therefore, the development of new drugs can proceed by targeting alternative pathways affecting detrusor overactivity. In this article, the pharmacological basis for the current therapeutic alternatives for managing detrusor overactivity and possible future developments are discussed.; It is clear that far from being a passive container for urine, the urothelium is a crucial part of the bladder. Its functions are complex, dynamic and important, and only now becoming understood. The release of ATP from urothelium in response to distension and its action on P2X receptors resulting in activating both motor and sensory neurons is being increasingly recognised. In the normal bladder, muscarinic receptor stimulation produces the main part of detrusor contraction. However, in functionally abnormal bladders, a non-cholinergic activation via the purinergic receptors may occur. The central nervous mechanisms controlling the micturition reflex have also recently attracted attention.; Recent research has suggested that several transmitters may modulate voiding. However, few drugs with clinical benefits have been developed so far. Present treatments for overactive bladders have significant non-compliance rates. Hopefully, future research will lead to drugs with greater therapeutic benefits and better tolerance.",E,E

The trial comprised a total of 358 patients with urge syndrome or urge incontinence. After randomisation in the ratio of 3:1, participants were treated continuously for 52 weeks with either trospium chloride (20 mg twice daily) or oxybutynin (5 mg twice daily). At intervals of 4-8 weeks, patients were physically examined with measurements of blood pressure and pulse rate, were questioned about any adverse events, checked for compliance and underwent relevant laboratory tests. As an additional safety measure, an ECG was made at 26 and 52 weeks. Urodynamic measurements were performed at the beginning, and at 26 and 52 weeks to determine the maximal cystometric bladder capacity. Among others things, the frequencies of micturition, incontinence and number of urgency events were recorded in patient diary protocols in weeks 0, 2, 26 and 52. The evaluation of vital parameters, laboratory results and ECGs did not show any relevant changes attributable to the action of the anticholinergics. Analysis of the micturition diary clearly indicated a reduction of the micturition frequency, incontinence frequency, and a reduction of the number of urgencies in both treatment groups. Mean maximum cystometric bladder capacity increased during treatment with trospium chloride by 92 ml after 26 weeks and 115 ml after 52 weeks (P=0.001). Further comparison with oxybutynin did not reveal any statistically significant differences in urodynamic variables between the drugs. Adverse events occurred in 64.8% of the patients treated with trospium chloride and 76.7% of those treated with oxybutynin. The main symptom encountered in both treatment group was dryness of the mouth. For patients on trospium chloride, the estimated risk of an unexpected adverse event was 0.027 per patient per week for all adverse events and 0.009 for dryness of the mouth, resulting in a considerably lower risk during treatment given with trospium chloride than with oxybutynin (0.045 and 0.021, respectively). An overall assessment for each of the drugs reveals a comparable efficacy level and a better benefit-risk ratio for trospium chloride than for oxybutynin due to better tolerability.",I,I

Those completing the trial were analysed 'per-protocol'. After a 7-day washout and a 3-day run-in to collect baseline information, patients were treated with tolterodine twice daily for 16 weeks. The two groups were compared for incontinence episodes/24 h, voiding frequency, nocturia episodes and pad usage after 16 weeks of treatment.; After 16 weeks the median changes from baseline for all voiding variables were statistically significant for the MI and the UI groups (P < 0.001), with no apparent significant between-group differences. The median percentage reduction in incontinence episodes from baseline was 67% for the MI and 75% for the UI groups (P = 0.39). 'Dry' rates for the MI and UI groups at the end of the study were 39% (66/171) and 44% (243/552), respectively, whilst 24% of patients in each group (MI 40/170; UI 130/551) achieved a voiding pattern of < 8 voids/24 h.

Multiple blood and saliva samples were collected. Pharmacokinetic parameters and total salivary output were assessed. Statistical analyses included 95% confidence intervals, paired t test, analysis of variance, and linear regression.; Steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved after the first transdermal application and after the second extended-release oral dose. Mean +/- SD 24-hour oxybutynin areas under the concentration-time curve were comparable during transdermal and oral extended-release treatments, 10.8 +/- 24 vs 9.2 +/- 33 ng x h(-1) x mL(-1), respectively. However, the ratio of area under the curve (N-desethyloxybutynin/oxybutynin) after transdermal administration (1.2 +/- 03) was significantly lower (P < .001) than after extended-release oral administration (4.1 +/- 0.9).

Mean +/- SD saliva output was greater during transdermal than extended-release oral treatment (15.7 +/- 93 vs 12.2 +/- 6.8 g, respectively; P = .02). Lower N-desethyloxybutynin during transdermal application was associated with greater saliva output (r = -059, P = .04). No clinically important treatment-related adverse effects were observed.; Transdermal oxybutynin administration results in greater systemic availability and minimizes metabolism to N-desethyloxybutynin compared with extended-release oral administration.

Efficacy was assessed by use of patient perception evaluations.; The results presented are a secondary analysis of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Of patients treated with tolterodine extended release, 44% reported improved urgency symptoms (compared with 32% for placebo), and 62% reported improved bladder symptoms (placebo, 48%) (both P<.001 compared with placebo). The odds of reducing urgency and improving bladder symptoms were 1.68 and 1.78 times greater, respectively, for patients in the tolterodine extended release group than for patients receiving placebo. In response to urgency, there was a more than six-fold increase in the proportion of patients able to finish a task before voiding in the tolterodine extended release group. The proportion of patients unable to hold urine upon experiencing urgency was also decreased by 58% with tolterodine, compared with 32% with placebo (P<.001). The proportion of patients reporting ""much benefit"" from treatment was greater for tolterodine extended release than for placebo (43% versus 24%; P<.001).

We present data on renal and bladder function initially and at followup of boys with PUV in whom the bladder dysfunction has been treated since infancy.; The study included 35 boys with PUV. Bladder regimen, including early toilet training from the age of 1.5 years and detrusor relaxant drugs for the treatment of incontinence from ages 4 to 6 years, was introduced to all patients. A total of 19 boys were started on clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) at a median age of 8 months due to pronounced bladder dysfunction with poor emptying, unsafe pressure levels, high grade reflux and renal impairment.; No serious complications of CIC have been seen during followup. Of the 19 boys 2 stopped performing CIC due to noncompliance of the parents at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Initial renal function, measured as median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in percent of expected for age, was 60% in the CIC group and 90% in the nonCIC group. At followup at a median age of 8 years the CIC group (n = 14, 3 transplanted boys excluded) had an increase in median differential GFR (difference between followup and initial GFR) of 7% (p <0.01), which was similar increase to that of the nonCIC group. In the 2 boys who stopped performing CIC renal function deteriorated with a median differential GFR of -24%. In the CIC group detrusor instability decreased. Poor compliance was seen in 6 of the 19 boys initially and only one remained poorly compliant. In 1 of the boys who stopped performing catheterization a low compliant bladder developed. In all of the other cases bladder capacity increased more than expected for age.; The results suggest that treatment of bladder dysfunction in boys with PUV can counteract the deterioration in renal function seen during childhood but the number of patients in our study is limited.",4,E

All cases had renal failure at birth. In all cases dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renography was performed. All RRU had reflux nephropathy; 5 RRU had moderate impairment of renal function (20-40%). In 3 RUU was demonstrated by a severe decrease in renal function (10-20% in 2 RUU, and less than 10% in 1 RUU). Micturating cystouretrography (MCUG) excluded the presence of posterior urethral valves; however, in all cases a tightened bladder neck (""bladder neck impression"") was present. Endoscopy was performed in one baby excluding posterior urethral valves. Follow up ranged from 2 to 5 years (mean 3.5).; In all 4 cases underwent transient urinary diversion during their first month of life. Urodynamic study revealed a high-risk bladder with low compliance, a reduced functional bladder capacity and a high residual urine volume in all cases. All the patients was placed on antibiotic prophylaxis and oral oxybutinin chloride. Three patients underwent bilateral Cohen ureteral reimplantation.

Currently therapy includes antibiotic prophylaxis in 4, oral oxybutinin in 4 and intermittent catheterisation in 2 patients. 3 patients have normal renal function. The other boy underwent re-diversion because of renal failure.; Fetal severe bilateral reflux nephropathy is a clinical entity almost exclusively in male neonate mimicking hyper-pressure syndrome due to urethral obstruction, in terms of evolution (to chronification and renal failure) and treatment (that requires primordial management of bladder dysfunction). Absence of anatomical urethral obstruction and urodynamic pattern suggest functional obstruction of bladder neck-periurethral sphincter complex in fetal life as a cause for this syndrome.

Urge incontinence and other subjective parameters (urinary frequency, urgency) improve in tandem with objective (cystometric) measures (maximum detrusor pressure during filling, volume at first desire to void, maximum bladder capacity) in ambulatory, including elderly, patients treated with oxybutynin. However, on the basis of results of limited investigations, the drug appears ineffective in elderly institutionalised individuals. Relative to other anticholinergic drugs, oxybutynin appears at least as effective as propantheline and similar in efficacy to propiverine in small trials, although these results are not definitive. Further investigation of intravesical oxybutynin may lead to this route becoming an option in patients with pre-existing catheters. Adverse effects--dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision--related to the anticholinergic activity of oxybutynin occur frequently and can be sufficiently troublesome to necessitate treatment discontinuation in up to 25% of patients, depending on the dosage. Increases in residual urine volume suggesting urinary retention (undesirable in patients with idiopathic DI), also can develop in some oxybutynin recipients. In summary, oxybutynin is one of the few drugs proven to be beneficial in some patients with overactive detrusor function. Despite the occurrence of unwanted anticholinergic effects in many patients, and apparent lack of efficacy in the elderly institutionalised population, oxybutynin should be considered for the drug of first choice in patients with detrusor overactivity, including the elderly ambulatory population, when pharmacological therapy is indicated.",E,E

Among those completing the trial, the percent of checks wet went from 26.5% to 23.7% on placebo to 20.2% on active drug. These changes were statistically significant but not clinically meaningful. A clinically significant decrease in the frequency of incontinence, which we defined as a relative reduction in the percent of checks wet of > 33%, occurred in 20 subjects (32%) while on active drug and in 12 subjects (19%) while on placebo (P = .48 by chi-square). Twenty-five subjects (40%) met our ""continence criteria"" of an average of one or less wet per day while on active drug, and 11 subjects (18%) achieved this goal on placebo (P = .005 by chi-square).; Oxybutynin does not add to the clinical effectiveness of PV in the majority of nursing home residents with urge type urinary incontinence. Selected residents may, however, become more responsive to PV while on oxybutynin. Our data are consistent with other studies of bladder relaxant medications in functionally impaired populations. New drugs and/or other interventions are needed for the large number of incontinent nursing home residents who do not respond well to PV.",I,I

Although its aetiology remains unclear recent evidence increasingly supports the lack of a normal nocturnal increase in ADH leading to nocturnal polyuria exceeding functional bladder capacity. Sleep patterns are probably normal although an arousal disorder might be a factor. Treatment should follow careful evaluation to determine if one is dealing with 'uncomplicated' or 'complicated' enuresis. Complicated enuresis requires further investigation. 'Uncomplicated enuresis' always requires reassurance and patient and parent education. Resource centres such as ERIC can provide information and advice. Active treatment should be tailored to the patients age, motivation and parental wishes. Behavioural modification techniques yield the highest long-term cure rate but require the most commitment and are rarely successful before the age of 7-8 years. Pharmacotherapy has been revolutionized by DDAVP which gives a response rate of up to 70% relatively free from side-effects but at the price of a high relapse rate after medication. Imipramine is less expensive than DDAVP but may be fatal in overdose. Anticholinergics should be reserved for those patients with significant diurnal symptoms or those who fail first-line pharmacotherapy. Overall patients and parents should be reassured by the high spontaneous cure rate.",E,E

In two children, brightly echogenic, non-shadowing particles were suspended in the bladder urine. In one of these, the particles swirled giving the impression of a ""snowstorm""; in the other, most of the particles gradually settled forming an irregular clump on the bladder base. In the remaining two children, the urine appeared diffusely hazy with innumerable tiny particles giving the impression of a fine mist filling the bladder. The sonographic appearance of the urine in the bladder after intravesical instillation of crushed tablets can be dramatic and can simulate pus, blood, fungus, or other debris in the bladder lumen. In the absence of clinical symptoms or hematuria, a history of recent infusion of medication into the bladder should be sought.",E,E
7856993,Incontinence in the nursing home.,Fecal Incontinence; Female; Humans; Male; Nursing Homes; Prevalence; United States; Urinary Incontinence,"Ouslander, J G; Schnelle, J F","Urinary and fecal incontinence are prevalent, disruptive, and expensive health problems in the nursing home population. Nursing home residents who are incontinent of urine should have a basic diagnostic assessment, including a focused history and bladder record, a targeted physical examination, a urinalysis, and a determination of postvoid residual urine volume done by catheterization or ultrasonography. Potentially reversible conditions, such as fecal impaction and drug side effects, should be identified and treated. Selected residents should have further urodynamic evaluation or other diagnostic tests. Prompted voiding, a simple, noninvasive behavioral intervention, is effective in managing daytime urinary incontinence in one quarter to one third of incontinent nursing home residents. If it is to be effective over a long period of time, this intervention must be targeted to those residents most likely to respond. Selected nursing home residents will benefit from other behavioral interventions, drug therapy, or surgery. Because of the morbidity associated with it, long-term catheterization should only be used for specific indications. Like urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence may be caused by potentially reversible conditions. After such conditions have been excluded, fecal incontinence can generally be managed effectively by avoiding fecal impaction and by using a systematic bowel-training protocol.",E,E

The possibility that these two drugs produce changes in central nervous electrical activity was examined in an open, prospective, phase I study involving 12 volunteers. Quantitative evaluation of the multichannel electroencephalogram obtained from young healthy volunteers showed statistically significant decreases in alpha and beta 1 activity after oxybutynin, but not after intravenous or oral administration of trospium chloride. The biological activity of both drugs was ascertained by continuous simultaneous recording of the heart rate. A decrease in heart rate was detected after oral administration of oxybutynin, and an increase was seen after i.v. administration of trospium chloride. The results suggest that trospium chloride is less likely to produce central nervous adverse effects than to oxybutynin.",E,E

The nucleoside drug cladribine is a potent lympholytic agent with few side-effects. We have studied its efficacy and safety in a randomised double-blind trial. 51 patients (48 entered as matched pairs) received four monthly courses of 0.7 mg/kg cladribine or placebo (saline) given through a surgically implanted central line. Neurologists with no knowledge of which medication the patient was receiving examined the patients monthly and noted two rating scale scores (Kurtzke and Scripps). Cerebrospinal fluid and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were done at 6 and 12 months. Average neurological scores, demyelinated volumes on MRI, and concentrations of oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid were stable or improved in the patients receiving cladrabine but continued to deteriorate in patients on placebo. Mean paired (placebo minus matched cladribine) differences at 12 months relative to baseline were 1.0 (SE 0.4) for the Kurtzke scores, -13.9 (2.3) for the Scripps scores, 4.57 (1.17) mL for demyelinated volumes, and 7.3 (3.3) arbitrary units for concentrations of oligoclonal bands. Cladribine was generally well tolerated and clinically significant toxicity occurred in only 1 patient, in whom severe marrow suppression developed with complete recovery after several months. 1 patient died of newly acquired hepatitis B, an event unlikely to be related to cladribine. We conclude that the immunosuppressive drug cladribine influences favourably the course of chronic progressive MS.",E,E

Sixteen female patients with large cystoceles did not demonstrate stress urinary incontinence on clinical examination and were included in this study. Additionally, 10 healthy female volunteers underwent the same test to study the effect of a vaginal pack on urethral dynamics. The vaginal pack revealed the presence of stress urinary incontinence in 11 patients (69%): 3 (19%) with type II (vesicourethral hypermobility) and 8 (50%) with type III (internal sphincteric deficiency). After insertion of the vaginal pack, urodynamic studies showed that the closing proximal urethral pressure in patients with stress urinary incontinence was significantly lower than in continent patients (p < 0.05). No significant change in urethral pressures was noted in volunteer subjects after vaginal pack insertion. Fluoroscopy showed kinking of the posterior urethra and enlargement of the most dependent portion of the cystocele, that is the lower half of the hourglass image. Our study suggests that the mechanisms of continence in these patients are multifactorial, including urethral kinking, urethral compression and pressure dissipation. The vaginal pack test is easy to perform, increases visualization of the vesicourethral unit when used with fluoroscopy, and can aid in the selection of patients who would benefit from anti-incontinence surgery and/or cystocele repair.",E,E

Atropine (10(-9)-10(-6) M), oxybutynin (10(-8)-10(-5) M), terodiline (10(-7)-10(-5) M) and propiverine (10(-7)-10(-5) M) caused parallel shifts to the right of the concentration-response curves to acetylcholine. The rank order of pA2 values was: atropine > oxybutynin > terodiline = propiverine. Atropine did not suppress the maximum contraction to acetylcholine, while the other drugs significantly suppressed the maximum contractions at the higher concentrations. Each drug caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the KCl (80 mM)- and CaCl2 (5 mM)-induced contractions; the maximum inhibitions of terodiline and propiverine were significantly greater than those of oxybutynin and atropine. Each drug caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the contraction induced by electrical field stimulation; the maximum inhibitions of terodiline and propiverine were significantly greater than those of oxybutynin and atropine. The results suggest that the drugs have both anticholinergic and calcium antagonistic effects. Furthermore, it also appears that part of the human bladder contraction, which was significantly inhibited by terodiline and propiverine, is an atropine-resistant component.",E,E

Of the 28 evaluable patients, 22 are currently continent and a complete urodynamic study was performed for the 6 (10%) incontinent patients. Of them, 3 showed uninhibited detrusor contractions. The vesical compliance was frequently within the normal limits. No case of detrusor-sphincteric dyssynergy or urethral hypotony was found. 2 were successfully treated by oxybutinin and biofeedback reeducation, 2 were partially improved but their prostates are still in growth and the possibility of implanting an artificial sphincter was discussed in the remaining 2.

The goal is to increase bladder capacity, and decrease intravesical pressure in order to maintain continence between catheterizations. The most commonly used anticholinergic medication in the United States is Oxybutynin. Previous clinical studies have shown that 61% of the patients on oral Oxybutynin report adverse systemic side effects and are noncompliant in taking it. In 48% of the patients, possibly due to their noncompliance, oral Oxybutynin Hydrochloride is ineffective. In this study, 13 spinal cord injured patients with a failure to restore bladder dysfunction were treated with intravesical Oxybutynin. Nine patients improved on the regimen while one patient underwent surgical bladder augmentation. Postoperatively, this patient continued to be incontinent between catheterizations. Reinstitution of intravesical Oxybutynin stabilized the patient's bladder with clean intermittent catheterization without further intervention. After 3 months post instillation in the urodynamic studies, the mean bladder capacity increased, the mean volume at first contraction increased and the leak point pressure decreased. The decrease in leak point pressure was statistically significant. Leak point pressure is one of the most important parameters we monitor to preserve upper urinary tract function. We recommend the trial of intravesical Oxybutynin for patients who fit the criteria of the protocol prior to surgical bladder augmentation.",E,E

We report on 22 children in whom a ureteral Mitrofanoff channel was created.; Between 1986 and 1995 a ureteral Mitrofanoff channel was constructed as a catheterizable conduit in 22 children 2 to 15 years old (average age 6.5) with various abnormalities of the lower urinary tract, mainly exstrophy and neurogenic bladder. Indications included unavailability or unsuitability of the appendix, preference for appendix as a catheterizable colonic stoma for antegrade washouts or concomitant removal of a nonfunctioning kidney, leaving the ureter available for use. Surgical technique was based on the principles of appendicovesicostomy and in 9 cases the ureteral Mitrofanoff channel was reimplanted.; Followup ranged from 1 to 72 months (average 30.5). Complications included stenosis of the conduit that caused difficult catheterization in 3 patients, necessitating dilation or minor revision in 2 and complete replacement by appendix in 1. Urinary leakage from the Mitrofanoff channel in 5 patients was treated with polydimethylsiloxane injection or oxybutinin. In 1 patient the channel was reimplanted, since the catheter struck the bladder neck during catheterization and caused severe pain.; Results of the ureteral Mitrofanoff channel seem somewhat less satisfactory than those of appendicovesicostomy but they remain acceptable and even comparable, strongly supporting its use in certain circumstances.",E,E

In addition, the drugs' ability to displace 3H-QNB from muscarinic receptors was investigated.; Both oxybutynin and N-desethyl-oxybutynin caused a rightward shift of the concentration-response curve for carbachol without depression of the maximum, indicating a competitive antagonism.

Tolterodine has a high affinity and specificity for muscarinic receptors in vitro and it exhibits a selectivity for the urinary bladder over salivary glands in vivo. A major active metabolite, (PNU-200577) the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative of tolterodine, has a similar pharmacological profile. Based on pharmacological and pharmacokinetic data, it has been concluded that this metabolite contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect of tolterodine. The bladder selectivity demonstrated by tolterodine and PNU-200577 in vivo cannot be attributed to selectivity for a single muscarinic receptor subtype. Moreover, this favourable tissue-selectivity seems to occur also in humans. Tolterodine is well tolerated and it exerts a marked effect on bladder function in healthy volunteers. Phase II data indicate that tolterodine is an efficacious and safe treatment for patients with idiopathic detrusor instability or detrusor hyperreflexia.

The aim of the present study was to compare the antimuscarinic properties of tolterodine with those of oxybutynin, in vitro and in vivo. Tolterodine effectively inhibited carbachol-induced contractions of isolated strips of urinary bladder from guinea pigs (K(B) 3.0 nM; pA2 8.6; Schild slope 0.97) and humans (K(B) 4.0 nM; pA2 8.4; Schild slope 1.04) in a concentration-dependent, competitive manner. The affinity of tolterodine was similar to that derived for oxybutynin (K(B) 4.4 nM; pA2 8.5; Schild slope 0.89) in the guinea-pig bladder. Tolterodine (21-2103 nmol/kg (0.01-1 mg/kg); intravenous infusion) was significantly more potent in inhibiting acetylcholine-induced urinary bladder contraction than electrically-induced salivation in the anaesthetised cat. In contrast, oxybutynin displayed the opposite tissue selectivity. Radioligand binding data showed that tolterodine bound with high affinity to muscarinic receptors in urinary bladder (K(i) 2.7 nM), heart (K(i) 1.6 nM), cerebral cortex (K(i) 0.75 nM) and parotid gland (K(i) 4.8 nM) from guinea pigs and in urinary bladder from humans (K(i) 3.3 nM). Tolterodine and oxybutynin were equipotent, except in the parotid gland, where oxybutynin bound with 8-times higher affinity (K(i) 0.62 nM). Binding data on human muscarinic m1-m5 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that oxybutynin, in contrast to tolterodine, exhibits selectivity (10-fold) for muscarinic m3 over m2 receptors. The K(B) value determined for oxybutynin (4.4 nM) in functional studies on guinea-pig bladder correlated better with the binding affinity at muscarinic M2/m2 receptors (K(i) 2.8 and 6.7 nM) than at muscarinic M3/m3 receptors (K(i) 0.62 and 0.67 nM). The tissue selectivity demonstrated for tolterodine in vivo cannot be attributed to selectivity for a single muscarinic receptor subtype. However, the combined in vitro and in vivo data on tolterodine and oxybutynin may indicate either that muscarinic M3/m3 receptors in glands are more sensitive to blockade than those in bladder smooth muscle, or that muscarinic M2/m2 receptors contribute to bladder contraction.",E,E

The effect of food ingestion on the serum concentrations of oxybutynin and N-desethyloxybutynin is expected to have minor clinical significance only.

On day 4, each volunteer ingested a single dose of 5 mg oxybutynin. Serum concentrations of oxybutynin, its active metabolite N-desethyloxybutynin, and itraconazole were monitored over 24 h.; Itraconazole significantly increased both the area under the serum drug concentration-time curve (AUC0-t) and the peak concentration of oxybutynin twofold.

Thirty-eight patients (35%) were identified as using oxybutynin on a regular basis. These patients were compared to those not using oxybutynin with regard to urodynamic parameters and upper tract deterioration. Specifically examined were bladder compliance, bladder leak point pressure, vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis, urolithiasis, febrile urinary tract infections and serum creatinine greater than 2 mg./dl.; The mean duration of indwelling catheter use was 11.9 years (12.4 without oxybutynin and 10.9 on oral oxybutynin). Of the 31 patients with normal compliance (greater than 20 ml./cm. water), 24 (77%) were using oxybutynin (p = 0.001). Bladder leak point pressures were abnormal (greater than 35 cm. water) in 5 of 32 patients (16%) on oxybutynin versus 34 of 60 (57%) without it (p <0.001).

Evaluation of the results took into account the etiology, pressure and volume at which the wave of instability appeared.; The results were evaluated according to patient subjective criteria. We observed a positive response (cure and improvement) to treatment with oxybutinin alone or oxybutinin+imipramine in 66.25% of the cases; side effects were observed in 44%. There was a 20% improvement in the positive response rate when the wave intensity was greater than 55 cm H2O and the bladder volume at which this occurred was greater than 150 ml. No patient treated with second line drug therapy (flavoxate, nifedipine and trospium chloride) cured.; The etiology of vesical instability did not influence response to therapy. Waves with a greater intensity and those that appeared at higher volumes responded better to treatment. Nearly half of the patients with side effects required a reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of the drug. Our results and those reported elsewhere indicate that non-responders to treatment with oxybutinin alone or in combination with imipramine are unlikely to improve with currently available drug therapy.",E,E

Efficacy was determined from micturition diaries and patient perception of their bladder condition. Safety and tolerability were assessed from adverse events and laboratory measures.; A total of 1,120 patients were randomized and treated at 134 centers. For the primary efficacy variable, the number of micturitions/24 hours, pooled results showed a significant decrease from baseline for the 1 mg tolterodine (P < 0.001), 2 mg tolterodine (P < 0.001), and 5 mg oxybutynin (P < 0.01) groups, compared to placebo. Both tolterodine doses and oxybutynin significantly decreased incontinence episodes/24 hours and significantly increased volume voided/micturition, compared to placebo. Tolterodine at a dose of 2 mg twice daily and 5 mg oxybutynin twice daily were significantly more effective in improving patient perception of bladder condition than placebo. Tolterodine at a dose of 2 mg and 5 mg oxybutynin were equivalent in their effectiveness. Tolterodine at doses of 1 mg and 2 mg were tolerated significantly better than oxybutynin when adverse events, dry mouth (both frequency and intensity), dose reductions, and patient withdrawals were considered.; Although oxybutynin is highly effective, its clinical utility is limited by systemic side effects that lead to frequent discontinuation of treatment or dose reductions. Patients receiving tolterodine should not experience these limitations and instead will get safe and long-term effective treatment for their condition.",E,E

In fact nocturnal enuresis delays early autonomy and socialisation by decreasing in self-esteem and self-confidence. Nocturnal enuresis classification is the preliminary step to correct therapy. Enuresis must be classified as primary (never acquired nocturnal control) or secondary (at least 6 months of dry nights). A child is also classified as having monosymptomatic enuresis if she/he experienced only night wetting and symptomatic enuresis if she/he experienced night wetting associated with diurnal voiding symptoms (urinated > or = 7 times a day, urgency, damp pants, squatting, holding the perineum, sitting on one heel). Monosymptomatic patients must be treated with desmopressin nasal spray at the daily dose of 20 micrograms at bed time. If the reduction of at least the 50% of the basal number of the wet nights is not achieved, the dosage must be increased until 40 micrograms. For patients affected by rhinitis or asthma, desmopressin is now available in tablets. In symptomatic patients desmopressin therapy must be associated to oxybutinin (5 mg x 2). Therapy interruption must be gradual with desmopressin reduction of 10 micrograms every 30 days. In symptomatic patients oxybutinin must be introduced only at bed time. The efficacy of the drugs depends on the therapy length. The highest percentage of success is obtained if the treatment is protracted for at least six months. Antidepressants are also used for nocturnal enuresis especially imipramine. The dosage varies between 0.5-1.5 mg/ kg/daily. As plasmatic levels are achieved only in 30% of treated patients, a 3-5 fold increase in suggested. Nevertheless these levels result in near toxic threshold concentration. Sporadic treatment purposes include amytriptiline, diclofenac sodicum, viloxsazine and methilphenidate if giggle incontinence is present. Non responders may be treated with alarm. If after 16 weeks of treatment no success is obtained alarm use must be interrupted.",E,E

Oxybutynin is the anticholinergic of choice for this indication, whereas propantheline is the second-line therapy. Although calcium antagonists have been investigated, the one such drug introduced for the treatment of overactive bladder (terodiline) was withdrawn from the market because of a risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Studies of potassium channel openers have found either a lack of clinical efficacy or an unacceptable level of side effects. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists may be useful for decreasing bladder overactivity in patients who have autonomous bladders as the result of conditions such as spinal cord injury. Tricyclic antidepressants (particularly imipramine) may be effective in decreasing bladder contractility, although the AHCPR guidelines caution that these drugs should be reserved for use in carefully evaluated patients. Future developments in the treatment of detrusor overactivity are likely to occur in 3 categories: drugs that affect peripheral excitatory mechanisms, drugs that inhibit afferent mechanisms, and drugs that affect more central actions at either the ganglionic, spinal cord, or supraspinal level.; Although pharmacologic management of the overactive bladder has progressed little in the past 10 years, the future may hold the promise of more effective therapies.",E,E

In patients with overactive bladder, toleterodine significantly reduces the frequency of micturition and number of incontinence episodes, while increasing the average volume voided. The onset of pharmacological action of tolterodine is < 1 hour and therapeutic efficacy is maintained during long term treatment.

The study enrolled 293 patients with urodynamically confirmed bladder overactivity, increased frequency of micturition (> or = micturitions/24 h) and symptoms of urgency and/or urge incontinence (> or = 1 episode/24 h). Patients received either tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) or oxybutynin (5 mg three times daily) or placebo. Doses could be reduced, to prevent withdrawal, to 1 mg or 2.5 mg, respectively. The main outcome measures were the mean change from baseline in frequency of micturition/24 h, the number of incontinent episodes/24 h and volume voided per micturition.; After 12 weeks' treatment, the mean frequency of micturition decreased by 21% and 19.5% in those receiving tolterodine (n = 118) and oxybutynin (n = 118), respectively, and by 10.5% in those on placebo (n = 57).

The effect of tolterodine and oxybutynin on these two micturition variables was statistically equivalent. There was also a comparable increase in mean volume voided per micturition in the tolterodine (27%) and oxybutynin groups (31%), compared with 7% in the placebo group. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event and was reported with greater frequency and intensity among patients receiving oxybutynin than among those receiving either tolterodine or placebo. In the oxybutynin group, more patients also withdrew because of adverse events and a greater proportion required dose reduction as a result of adverse events. Despite dose reduction, the frequency of adverse events and the intensity of dry mouth remained higher among those receiving oxybutynin (2.5 mg three times daily) than in patients who remained on tolterodine 2 mg twice daily.; Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of bladder overactivity. Tolterodine was better tolerated than oxybutynin, particularly with respect to the frequency and intensity of dry mouth, but had comparable clinical efficacy. The superior tolerability of tolterodine therefore allows more patients to remain on effective therapy than the current most commonly prescribed agent for the treatment of the overactive bladder.",I,I

The aim of this study was to compare the in vitro and in vivo antimuscarinic profiles of tolterodine with those of muscarinic receptor antagonists with distinct receptor subtype-selectivity profiles: darifenacin [(S)-2-[1-[2-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl)ethyl]-3-pyrrolidinyl]-2,2-d iphenylacetamide; selective for muscarinic M3 receptors]; UH-AH 37 (6-chloro-5,10-dihydro-5-[(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)acetyl]-11H-dibenzo-[b ,e][1,4]diazepine-11-one; low affinity for muscarinic M2 receptors); and AQ-RA 741 (11-([4-[4-(diethylamino)butyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-py rido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one; high affinity for muscarinic M2 receptors). The in vitro profiles of these compounds were in agreement with previous reports; darifenacin and UH-AH 37 demonstrated selectivity for muscarinic M3/m3 over M2/m2 receptors, while the converse was observed for AQ-RA 741. In vivo, AQ-RA 741 was more potent (1.4-2.7-fold) in inhibiting urinary bladder contraction than salivation in the anaesthetised cat (i.e., a profile similar to that of tolterodine [2.5-3.3-fold]), while darifenacin and UH-AH 37 showed the reverse selectivity profile (0.6-0.8 and 0.4-0.5-fold, respectively). The results confirm that it is possible to separate the antimuscarinic effects on urinary bladder and salivary glands in vivo. The data on UH-AH 37 and darifenacin support the view that a selectivity for muscarinic M3/m3 over M2/m2 receptors may result in a more pronounced effect on salivation than on bladder contraction. The data on AQ-RA 741 may indicate that muscarinic M2/m2 receptors may have a role in bladder contraction.",E,E

Recently, the use of oxybutynin, a compound with anticholinergic, smooth muscle relaxant and local anesthetic effects, has become widely used with both oral and intravesical administration.; In this study we report 39 children with myelodysplasia, neurogenic bladder disturbance with detrusor hyperreflexia and/or high bladder pressure treated with CIC to which intravesical oxybutynin 0.1 mg/kg twice daily was added and administered as a sterile pharmacy-produced solution. The follow-up period was 0.66-5 years (mean 2.25).; Continence was clearly promoted and urodynamic parameters improved whereas an increased occurrence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and lower urinary tract infections was noted. Compliance was good, adverse reactions rare, and in some cases vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) resolved. Also infants and very young children were treated without complications.; Intravesical oxybutynin is effective to diminish bladder pathophysiology and promote continence in this patient group and is also well tolerated. Attention should be paid to the occurrence of urinary tract infections and VUR may resolve.",E,E

Currently, there is no medication available that specifically targets the lower urinary tract without having untoward effects elsewhere in the body. Patients with urge incontinence are the most difficult group to treat. The agents most commonly used to treat urge incontinence, i.e. anticholinergics, musculotropics and tricyclic antidepressants, are limited in their effectiveness and have anticholinergic adverse effects. Other medications with theoretical treatment potential such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium antagonists require more in depth clinical study before widespread use is appropriate. Although estrogen is well tolerated, its role in the treatment of incontinence in postmenopausal women may be limited. Medical treatment for stress incontinence is most successful in patients with a mild condition. Drugs with alpha-adrenergic activity alone or in combination with estrogen in postmenopausal women, are fairly effective and demonstrate few adverse effects at doses used to treat stress incontinence. Enuresis pharmacotherapy consists mainly of desmopressin and tricyclic antidepressants. Adverse effects are minimal with the doses commonly used. While the majority of patients improve with therapy, a significant portion relapse after treatment is terminated. Tolerability of a particular therapy depends on the effectiveness and adverse effects of the agent, the severity of incontinence and the general health of the patient. In general, patients are willing to accept a greater degree of inconvenience if a drug produces the desired effect. However, individualisation of therapy should be used to maximise compliance and outcome. Blinded, dose-titration studies are needed to better determine doses for optimum tolerability. Research into drugs specifically targeting the lower urinary tract may lead to more effective and well tolerated therapy for incontinence and enuresis.",I,E

Trospium chloride was most effective in relaxing contractions elicited by muscarinic stimulation, while flavoxate was significantly less effective than all other drugs tested. The relaxing potency of oxybutynin was greater than those of PDE-inhibitors papaverine and vinpocetine but 3,000 fold less significant than those of trospium chloride. The effects of the individual drugs on muscarinic tension of both human and porcine detrusor muscle strips were nearly equal. The present results suggest that the pig might be an appropriate animal model for the study of effects of spasmolytic substances on the contractility of urinary bladder smooth muscle in vitro.",E,E

In both patients seizures were associated with discontinuation of short-term agents with high antimuscarinic properties. Hence, abrupt discontinuation of antimuscarinics or anticholinergics with high antimuscarinic properties in patients receiving long-term acetylcholinesterase inhibition therapy may be associated with a reduction of seizure threshold. With increasing administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for patients with Alzheimer's disease, practitioners should be aware of the potential for drug-drug interactions and other complications. In general, it is good medical practice to avoid concomitant administration with centrally acting anticholinergic agents.",E,E

The patients then were treated for 6 weeks with either remoxipride or haloperidol, and their P300s were reassessed.; P300s were attenuated and delayed among neuroleptic-free patients. There was no evidence of peak lateralization or amplitude asymmetry over temporal areas. Subsequent neuroleptic medication normalized P300 latencies and increased P300 amplitudes, but the latter remained below normal limits over all except frontal areas. There were no correlations between P300 latency or amplitude and clinical symptomatology either before or after treatment.; The finding of a P300 delay in neuroleptic-free schizophrenics that is normalized by neuroleptic medication has not been reported previously. Neuroleptic effects on P300 amplitude and latency appear to be independent of effects on clinical symptoms, and cannot be attributed to anticholinergic activity.",E,E

Primary peristalsis was elicited by swallowing a 5 mL water bolus and secondary peristalsis by insufflation of 20 mL air, 10 times each. Oesophageal potentials were evoked by electrical stimulation in the distal and proximal oesophagus (30 stimulations at 0.4 Hz, two runs).; Both anticholinergic drugs reduced by a similiar amount the contraction amplitudes (TC 17 mmHg, BIP 25 mmHg, saline 67 mmHg; P < 0.01) and the rate of secondary contractions (TC 60%, BIP 70%, saline 95%; P < 0.01). In contrast, only biperiden prolonged the latencies of the evoked potentials (N1 peak, distal oesophagus: BIP 191 ms, TC 102 ms, saline 101 ms; P < 0.01; P1 peak: BIP 322 ms, TC 161 ms, saline 144 ms; P < 0.01).; Both anticholinergic drugs depress oesophageal motility, but only the centrally-acting anticholinergic drug biperiden modifies the oesophageal evoked potentials, suggesting a central cholinergic transmission of the oesophageal afferent pathways.",E,E

Subjects had to have urodynamic evidence of bladder dysfunction, be ambulatory, and not have dementia.; Subjects were randomized to 4 sessions (8 weeks) of biofeedback-assisted behavioral treatment, drug treatment (with oxybutynin chloride, possible range of doses, 2.5 mg daily to 5.0 mg 3 times daily), or a placebo control condition.; Reduction in the frequency of incontinent episodes as determined by bladder diaries, and patients' perceptions of improvement and their comfort and satisfaction with treatment.; For all 3 treatment groups, reduction of incontinence was most pronounced early in treatment and progressed more gradually thereafter. Behavioral treatment, which yielded a mean 80.7% reduction of incontinence episodes, was significantly more effective than drug treatment (mean 68.5% reduction; P=.04) and both were more effective than the placebo control condition (mean 39.4% reduction; P<.001 and P=.009, respectively). Patient-perceived improvement was greatest for behavioral treatment (74.1% ""much better"" vs 50.9% and 26.9% for drug treatment and placebo, respectively). Only 14.0% of patients receiving behavioral treatment wanted to change to another treatment vs 75.5% in each of the other groups.; Behavioral treatment is a safe and effective conservative intervention that should be made more readily available to patients as a first-line treatment for urge and mixed incontinence.",E,E

Free concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HM at pM and nM (pg/ml and ng/ml) levels were obtained by ultrafiltration of 40-400 microliters plasma at 37 degrees C. The free fraction (%) was independent of the plasma concentrations of the analytes. Detection of the analytes was performed by sheathless electrospray tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple-reaction monitoring mode. The selectivity of the mass spectrometric detection and the additional clean-up on the pre-column allowed direct injection of the ultrafiltrated plasma samples. Tolterodine and 5-HM were pre-concentrated on a reversed-phase capillary pre-column (1 cm x 200 microns) and subsequently backflushed onto the separation column (25 cm x 200 microns). The stability of the chromatographic system was good; a large number of ultrafiltrated plasma samples could be injected and the relative standard deviation of the retention times was typically < or = 1% (within-day). The accuracy was between 86 and 105% and the precision was between 1 and 7% without the use of an internal standard. Linear calibration curves were obtained between 100 pM and 100 nM.",E,E
