"1",9495,"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a common and severe psychiatric disorder precipitated by exposure to a psychologically distressing event. PTSD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is characterized by the presence of three distinct, but co-occurring, symptom clusters. Research evidence suggests that PTSD has a neurobiological basis. Current research on the neurobiology of PTSD include the utilization of functional brain imaging molecular genetic research; the incorporation of cross-system research including neuroendocrine, neurochemical, and neuroimmunological systems.

"3",12512,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by intrusive memories, marked avoidance of trauma reminders, affective numbing, and hyperarousal following a traumatic experience was introduced into the diagnostic nomenclature in 1980 with the publication by the American Psychiatric Association of DSM-III. Since then, a large body of research on the presentation and treatment of PTSD has been assembled. A number of efficacious cognitive–behavioral therapies (CBTs) are now offered, such as prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapy (CPT; [3]), and the rates of successful treatment in a variety of populations are improving. Symptoms and diagnostic criteria In the DSM-IV-TR, there are six diagnostic criteria (Criterion A-F) that must be present for a diagnosis of PTSD. First, the individual must have experienced a traumatic event (Criterion A) during which: (1) the person experienced or witnessed an event or events that involved actual threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of oneself or others; and (2) the person's reaction involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror (in children this may present as agitated or disorganized behavior). Examples of traumatic events include serious threats to life or physical integrity such as military combat, sexual assault, motor vehicle accidents, physical assault, natural or human-made disasters, or witnessing violence or severe human suffering. The symptoms of PTSD are categorized into three clusters in DSM-IV (Criterion B, C, and D): intrusive recollection, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal symptoms. © Cambridge University Press 2010.","post-traumatic stress disorder",0,0
"4",9499,"Sleep disturbances are common complaints among patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as intrusive recollection, avoidance of disturbing stimuli, difficulty in concentration, and depressive symptoms. Patients with PTSD frequently report difficulty falling or staying asleep and recurrent nightmares related to the traumatic events. These sleep disturbances are part of the diagnostic criteria for PTSD and are included in both the re-experiencing (Criterion B) and increased arousal (Criterion D) symptom cluster in the DSM-IV-TR. Despite these sleep complaints, polysomnographic studies have not provided consistent evidence of sleep disturbances, especially regarding non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. However, the characteristic sleep disturbances, in particular the repetitive, stereotypical nightmares may be relatively specific to PTSD. The presence of nightmares in PTSD has been hypothesized as a dysfunction of REM sleep mechanisms and investigators have reported various types of REM sleep abnormalities. Treatment studies also have shown that antidepressants, such as nefazodone, trazodone, fluvoxamine, and image rehearsal therapy are beneficial in the treatment of PTSD-related sleep disturbances as well as core symptoms of this anxiety disorder; however, these sleep disturbances may persist and impair the quality of life in PTSD patients for several decades. It is important, therefore, to understand the characteristics of sleep disturbances in PTSD and these treatments. In this review, we discuss the clinical features and objective findings of sleep disturbances in PTSD and these treatments based on the published literature, including our findings. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

"6",591,"Much evidence has shown that PTSD is significantly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Suicide is an important cause of death in veterans, and the risk for intentional death continues to be high many years after service. Specific PTSD symptoms and specific psychological conditions associated with chronic stress reactions may contribute or mediate the association between PTSD and suicidal behavior. Furthermore, patients with PTSD often have comorbid disorders that may lead to a further increase of risk of suicide in these patients. Research has demonstrated that the magnitude of guilt, cluster B symptoms and comorbid depression were associated with increased suicide risk in PTSD Veterans. For the first time since the Vietnam War, the suicide rate in the military is higher than that in the general population, and so preventive strategies are extremely important to reduce suicide risk in deployed troops. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

"8",13065,"Women have a higher susceptibility than men to a set of psychosocial factors that have been linked to increased risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD), such as depression, early life adversities, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this chapter we discuss the notion that these psychosocial risk factors, particularly if they are present at young age, may set a trajectory of increased IHD risk in women, even though clinical events may occur years later. Emerging data suggest that young women are uniquely susceptible to the adverse cardiovascular effects psychosocial stress, which can result in earlier onset of IHD or more adverse prognosis if the disease is already manifest. Women’s vulnerability to psychosocial stress could also play a role in sex differences in the pathophysiology of IHD; for example it could help explain their higher propensity to abnormal coronary vasomotion and micro-vascular disease, which has been described in women compared with men. Young women are severely under-represented in studies of cardiovascular disease. In future research, it will be crucial to study women earlier in their life to better understand the risk pathways linking psychosocial stress to IHD risk, in order to devise successful preventive and treatment strategies to ameliorate such risk. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","psychosocial risk factors in women: special reference to depression and posttraumatic stress disorder",0,0
"9",2829,"This chapter presents new clinical applications of the prototypic GABAB receptor agonist baclofen for the treatment of addiction by drugs of abuse, such as alcohol, cocaine, nicotine, morphine, and heroin, a novel baclofen prodrug Arbaclofen placarbil, the GABAB receptor agonist AZD3355 (Lesogabaran) currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and four positive allosteric modulators of GABAB receptors (CGP7930, GS39783, NVP-BHF177, and BHFF), which have less propensity for the development of tolerance due to receptor desensitization than classical GABAB receptor agonists. All four compounds showed anxiolytic affects. In the presence of positive allosteric modulators the ""classical"" GABAB receptor antagonists CGP35348 and 2-hydroxy-saclofen showed properties of partial GABAB receptor agonists. Seven micromolar affinity GABAB receptor antagonists, phaclofen; 2-hydroxy-saclofen; CGP's 35348, 36742, 46381, 51176; and SCH50911, are discussed. CGP36742 (SGS742) showed statistically significant improvements of working memory and attention in a Phase 2 clinical trial in mild, but not in moderate Alzheimer patients. Eight nanomolar affinity GABAB receptor antagonists are presented (CGP's 52432, 54626, 55845, 56433, 56999, 61334, 62349, and 63360) that were used by pharmacologists for numerous in vitro and in vivo investigations. CGP's 36742, 51176, 55845, and 56433 showed antidepressant effects. Several compounds are also available as radioligands, such as [3H]CGP27492, [3H]CGP54626, [3H]CGP5699, and [3H]CGP62349. Three novel fluorescent and three GABAB receptor antagonists with very high specific radioactivity (>2,000Ci/mmol) are presented.

"10",1651,"The trajectory of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and PTSD-related symptoms in relation to aging is not well understood. We previously observed higher levels of dissociation as measured by the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) among older Holocaust survivors with, compared to those without, PTSD, though scores on the DES in Holocaust survivors were markedly lower than those that had been reported for younger cohorts. We undertook a longitudinal evaluation of dissociation in Holocaust survivors. Twenty-six Holocaust survivors with current PTSD, 30 Holocaust survivors without current PTSD, and 19 nonexposed were evaluated at the initial evaluation and subsequently 8.11 years later. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the DES scores from these times demonstrated a significant main effect for time and a significant group by time interaction, reflecting a marked decline in Holocaust survivors, particularly those with PTSD. Controlling for age obliterated the effect of time, but not the group by time interaction. A similar pattern was shown with The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores. Different symptoms related to PTSD show different trajectories of change with age, with dissociation appearing to be less prominent with age.

"11",1464,"The current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in a large cohort of military personnel exposed to combat-related psychological trauma as well as biomechanical trauma, including proximity to blast events. Historically, the long-term effects of both types of trauma have been viewed as having different neural substrates, with some controversy over the proper attribution of such symptoms evident after each of the major conflicts of the last century. Recently, great effort has been directed toward distinguishing which neuropsychiatric sequelae are due to which type of trauma. Of interest, however, is that the chronic effects of exposure to either process are associated with a significant overlap in clinical symptoms. Furthermore, similar brain regions are vulnerable to the effects of either psychological or biomechanical trauma, raising the possibility that shared mechanisms may underlie the clinically observed overlap in symptom profile. This paper reviews the literature on the neural substrate of biomechanical and psychological injury and discusses the implications for evaluation and treatment of the neuropsychiatric sequelae of these processes.

Trauma history and symptoms were assessed through structured clinical interviews and standardized self-report measures. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze the effects of trauma symptoms on trajectories of cortisol reactivity to and recovery from the interpersonal stress. Trauma-related anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and dissociation significantly predicted cortisol reactivity and recovery. Trauma-related anxiety, sleep disturbances, and sexual problems significantly predicted partners' cortisol reactivity to interpersonal stress.

"14",1604,"A key assumption in the study of stress-induced cognitive and neurobiological modifications is that alterations in hippocampal functioning after stress are due to an excessive activity exerted by the amygdala on the hippocampus. Research so far focused on stress-induced impairment of hippocampal plasticity and memory but an exposure to stress may simultaneously also result in strong emotional memories. In fact, under normal conditions emotionally charged events are better remembered compared with neutral ones. Results indicate that under these conditions there is an increase in activity within the amygdala that may lead to memory of a different quality. Studying the way emotionality activates the amygdala and the functional impact of this activation we found that the amygdala modulates memory-related processes in other brain areas, such as the hippocampus. However, this modulation is complex, involving both enhancing and suppressing effects, depending on the way the amygdala is activated and the hippocampal subregion examined. The current review summarizes our findings and attempts to put them in context with the impact of an exposure to a traumatic experience, in which there is a mixture of a strong memory of some aspects of the experience but impaired memory of other aspects of that experience. Toward that end, we have recently developed an animal model for the induction of predisposition to stress-related disorders, focusing on the consequences of exposure to stressors during juvenility on the ability to cope with stress in adulthood. Exposing juvenile-stressed rats to an additional stressful challenge in adulthood revealed their impairment to cope with stress and resulted in significant elevation of the amygdala. Interestingly, and similar to our electrophysiological findings, differential effects were observed between the impact of the emotional challenge on CA1 and dentate gyrus subregions of the hippocampus. Taken together, the results indicate that long-term alterations within the amygdala contribute to stress-related mnemonic symptoms and suggest that elucidating further these intra-amygdala alterations and their effects on modulating other brain regions is likely to be beneficial for the development of novel approaches to treat stress-related disorders.

"15",5761,"OBJECTIVE: Systematic reviews highlight a broad range of cancer-related post-traumatic stress disorder (CR-PTSD) prevalence estimates in cancer survivors. This meta-analysis was conducted to provide a prevalence estimate of significant CR-PTSD symptoms and full diagnoses to facilitate the psychological aftercare of cancer survivors. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted for studies using samples of cancer survivors by using validated clinical interviews and questionnaires to assess the prevalence of CR-PTSD (k = 25, n = 4189). Prevalence estimates were calculated for each assessment method using random-effects meta-analysis. Mixed-effects meta-regression and categorical analyses were used to investigate study-level moderator effects. RESULTS: Studies using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version yielded lower event rates using cut-off [7.3%, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 4.5-11.7, k = 10] than symptom cluster (11.2%, 95% CI = 8.7-14.4, k = 9). Studies using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition (SCID), yielded low rates for lifetime (15.3%, 95% CI = 9.1-25, k = 5) and current CR-PTSD (5.1%, 95% CI = 2.8-8.9, k = 9). Between-study heterogeneity was substantial (I2 = 54-87%). Studies with advanced-stage samples yielded significantly higher rates with PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version cluster scoring (p = 0.05), and when assessing current CR-PTSD on the SCID (p = 0.05). The effect of mean age on current PTSD prevalence met significance on the SCID (p = 0.05). SCID lifetime prevalence rates decreased with time post-treatment (R2 = 0.56, p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: The cancer experience is sufficiently traumatic to induce PTSD in a minority of cancer survivors. Post-hoc analyses suggest that those who are younger, are diagnosed with more advanced disease and recently completed treatment may be at greater risk of PTSD. More research is needed to investigate vulnerability factors for PTSD in cancer survivors. (c) 2014 The Authors.

"20",12297,"Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent, debilitating, and difficult to treat psychiatric disorder [1]. Very little is known of how PTSD affects neuroplasticity in the developing adolescent brain. Whereas multiple lines of research implicate amygdala-centered network dysfunction in the pathophysiology of adult PTSD [1,2], no study has yet examined the functional architecture of amygdalar networks in adolescent PTSD. Using intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) analysis, we investigated the inherent/spontaneous functional connectivity of the basolateral (BLA) and centromedial (CMA) amygdala in sexually abused adolescents with PTSD relative to matched controls. Additionally, we examined whether altered amygdala subregional connectivity coincides with abnormal grey matter volume of the amygdaloid complex. Methods: Seed-based correlation analysis was employed to examine the iFC of the BLA and CMA subnuclei in 19 adolescents with PTSD (age 16.2±1.8) relative to 23 age, sex and IQ matched controls (age 15.5±1.78). Subject-level iFC maps were generated by calculating temporal correlations between BLA and CMA signals and signal from all other brain voxels in a general linear model, while correcting for physiological and motion-related noise. Motion censoring (also known as scrubbing) was additionally applied to remove the effects of micro-motion on subject-level iFC maps [3]. Subject-level iFC maps were then fed into a grouplevel mixed-effects analysis with multiple comparisons correction (Z>2.3, p<0.05). Optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed to examine grey matter volume of BLA and CMA subnuclei. Structural images were grey matter-segmented, a study-specific grey matter template was created, and all nativespace grey matter images were registered to this template. Next, voxelwise permutation-based non-parametric testing was restricted to the BLA and CMA subnuclei and corrected for multiple comparisons (p<0.05). Finally, partial correlation analysis in patients examined the association between connectivity strength within regions of significant group differences and PTSD symptoms of stress and anxiety. Age, sex, and IQ were included in all analyses as covariates. Results: Our analysis revealed abnormal amygdalar connectivity and morphology in adolescent PTSD patients. More specifically, PTSD patients showed diminished right BLA connectivity with a cluster including dorsal and ventral portions of the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices (p<0.05, corrected). In contrast, PTSD patients showed increased left CMA connectivity with a cluster including the orbitofrontal and subcallosal cortices (p<0.05, corrected). Critically, these connectivity changes coincided with diminished grey matter volume within BLA and CMA subnuclei (p<0.05, corrected), and were predictive of more severe PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: These findings provide unique insights into how perturbations in major amygdalar circuits could hamper fear regulation and drive excessive acquisition and expression of fear in PTSD. As such, they represent an important step towards characterizing the neurocircuitry of adolescent PTSD, thereby informing the development of reliable biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. We speculate that abnormal stress and anxiety early in life may cause the reconfiguration of amygdalar networks reported here and exacerbate vulnerability for stress-related psychopathology.","abnormal functional architecture of amygdala-centered networks in adolescent posttraumatic stress disorder",0,0

The aim of this study was to identify psychiatric differences between somatoform pain patients from the former Yugoslavia and Austria. The study was conducted at the Behavioural Medicine Outpatient Pain Clinic, Department of Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna. Method: With a case-control design, this study compared 25 consecutive chronic pain patients of Austrian ethnic origin (8 women, age: 48.2 (plus or minus) 10.4 years) to 25 age- ((plus or minus) 2 years) and gender-matched chronic pain patients from the former Yugoslavia (8 women, age: 48.0 (plus or minus) 10.0 years). The assessment of patients was based on a comprehensive pain questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Whiteley Index (WI), the WHOQoL-Bref questionnaire, and the Structural Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV (SCID-I and SCID-II). Patients were assessed according to their background either in German or in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian language. Results: Depressive symptomatology, as measured on the BDI, showed a highly significant difference between the two groups (30.4 (plus or minus) 11.9 vs. 21.1 (plus or minus) 12.3; p = 0.009). In addition to that, also hypochondrical concerns were significantly more pronounced among patients from the former Yugoslavia. 100 % of the ex-Yugoslav patients fulfilled the criteria for an affective disorder, as compared to 80 % (p = 0.02) in the Austrian control group. The ex-Yugoslav patients also showed a significantly higher incidence of PTSD (48 %). However, no significant difference was observed between both groups as regards anxiety disorders or substance dependency (alcohol, nicotine, sedatives). The results of SCID-II testing revealed a significantly higher rate of cluster A personality disorders among patients from the former Yugoslavia. Both patient groups reported a reduced quality of life, with the psychological quality of life level significantly lower among patients from the former Yugoslavia. Discussion: High PTSD prevalence rates may be regarded as one of the potential causes for the high comorbidity with affective disorders among the ex-Yugoslav patients. This has to be put in context with the war in the Balkans during the 1990s. With regard to cluster A personality disorders, vulnerability factors are to be taken into account. Resolving this issue, however, still requires further research.","transcultural differences in somatoform pain disorder. a comparative study with patients from the former yugoslavia and austria",0,0

Results: Depressive symptomatology, as measured on the BDI, showed a highly significant difference between the two groups (30.4 ± 11.9 vs. 21.1 ± 12.3; p = 0.009). In addition to that, also hypochondrical concerns were significantly more pronounced among patients from the former Yugoslavia. 100 % of the ex-Yugoslav patients fulfilled the criteria for an affective disorder, as compared to 80 % (p = 0.02) in the Austrian control group. The ex-Yugoslav patients also showed a significantly higher incidence of PTSD (48 %). However, no significant difference was observed between both groups as regards anxiety disorders or substance dependency (alcohol, nicotine, sedatives). The results of SCID-II testing revealed a significantly higher rate of cluster A personality disorders among patients from the former Yugoslavia. Both patient groups reported a reduced quality of life, with the psychological quality of life level significantly lower among patients from the former Yugoslavia. Discussion: High PTSD prevalence rates may be regarded as one of the potential causes for the high comorbidity with affective disorders among the ex-Yugoslav patients. This has to be put in context with the war in the Balkans during the 1990s. With regard to cluster A personality disorders, vulnerability factors are to be taken into account. Resolving this issue, however, still requires further research.","transcultural differences in somatoform pain disorder. a comparative study with patients from the former yugoslavia and austria",0,0
"24",1982,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the features related with the referral reasons, sociodemog- raphic features, diagnoses of mental disorders, treatment processes and criminal profiles of all the child and adolescent forensic cases who were referred to forensic medicine and child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) clinics by judicial authorities to get forensic report in Aydi{dotless}n city as well as was to inference the general profile of this city for this age bracket. Methods: All the data from child and adolescent forensic cases referred to forensic medicine and CAP clinics throughout the year in order to be examined for a forensic report have been retro spectively analyzed. Results: One hundred and fifty of total 272 cases were female (42.3%) and 157 were male (57.7%) and the average age was determined as 13.46(plus or minus)2.3. All the cases were analyzed according to the crime types or referral reasons; 147 of them due to drifting into crime while 85 cases were referred due to sexual abuse. In the cases referred to CAP clinics, sexual abuse was the most populated reason with the number of 85 (31.6%). The most common referral reasons of the cases drifting into crime were theft and malicious injury with the numbers of 77 (52.4%) and 26 (17.7%) respectively among 147 cases. The most common mental disorder was the post-traumatic stress disorder among sexual abuse cases. Fifty percent point six of those cases have been initiated treatment however only 37.2% of the cases were detected as maintaining the treatment. Conclusion: The first step in the fight against child and adolescent forensic cases being sexually abused and drifted into crime is consciousness of the individual and familial characteristics of those children and the differences of these among other regions. New efforts which will be carried out in collaboration with health care institutions and other related departments are required in order to maintain psychiatric treatment and follow-up during the process of bringing those children to healthy individuals in society.","evaluation of child and adolescent forensic cases within one year in aydi{dotless}n city, in turkey",0,0

"26",2127,"Anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress are characterized by an impaired ability to learn that cues previously associated with danger no longer represent a threat. However, the mechanisms underlying fear extinction remain unclear. We found that fear extinction in rats was associated with increased levels of synaptic inhibition in fear output neurons of the central amygdala (CEA). This increased inhibition resulted from a potentiation of fear input synapses to GABAergic intercalated amygdala neurons that project to the CEA. Enhancement of inputs to intercalated cells required prefrontal activity during extinction training and involved an increased transmitter release probability coupled to an altered expression profile of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Overall, our results suggest that intercalated cells constitute a promising target for pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders. (copyright) 2010 Nature America, Inc.

"29",1235,"Anxiety disorders are widespread psychiatric conditions with significant social and professional disability, poor quality of life, an increased risk of suicide, and frequent attendance of medical services. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) have demonstrated a rather robust efficacy for the treatment of most of anxiety disorders. Nevertheless a substantial number of patients are resistant or still suffer from residual symptoms despite this first line treatment. The objective of our paper is to review relevant studies for the pharmacologic management of anxiety disorders resistant to the first line treatment. For this purpose, we conducted a pubmed/medline search for double-blind placebo-controlled trials of treatment-resistant anxiety disorders. An adequate trial for a SRI in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) should continue for at least 12 weeks. Special considerations of the comorbidities and symptom profile could help in the choice of an appropriate pharmacotherapy. Several trials have highlighted the efficacy of antipsychotics as an add-on to SRI in treatment-resistant OCD such as haloperidol more so when comorbid with a tic disorder, or risperidone that can reduce OCD as well as depressive symptoms. Aripiprazole has been shown efficacious in two placebo-controlled double-blind trials, while the efficacy of quetiapine and olanzapine remains controversial. Other trials showed some efficacy of anticonvulsants (lamotrigine, topiramate), pindolol, memantin and N-acetylcystein as an adjunctive treatment to SRI for resistant OCD. Few trials have investigated selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or SNRI resistant generalized anxiety disorder showing a failure of adjunctive therapy with olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone and risperidone. These studies were underpowered and very limited in number. Adjunctive risperidone for resistant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) showed benefit in some but not all trials. Olanzapine was beneficial for the reduction of the CAPS score in addition to the improvement of sleep disturbances. Furthermore, prazosin was efficacious by reducing PTSD symptoms, sleep disturbances, nightmares, and psychological distress. One double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate treatment-resistant social phobia showing no benefit of pindolol add-on paroxetine. Our results demonstrate that the pharmacological management of treatment-resistant anxiety disorders is not sufficiently investigated in double-blind placebo-controlled trials, despite a growing evidence in favor of antipsychotics and some other pharmacological agents in resistant OCD and, to a lesser extent, PTSD. Hence, there is a crucial need for larger double-blind placebo-controlled trials for resistant anxiety disorders. Finally, being out of the scope of our review, we omitted studies of non-pharmacologic therapies.",NA,0,0

"34",10994,"Purpose: A dissociative-posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) subtype has been included in the DSM-5. However, it is not yet clear whether certain socio-demographic characteristics or psychological/clinical constructs such as comorbid psychopathology differentiate between severe PTSD and dissociative-PTSD. The current study investigated the existence of a dissociative-PTSD subtype and explored whether a number of trauma and clinical covariates could differentiate between severe PTSD alone and dissociative-PTSD. Methods: The current study utilized a sample of 432 treatment seeking Canadian military veterans. Participants were assessed with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and self-report measures of traumatic life events, depression, and anxiety. CAPS severity scores were created reflecting the sum of the frequency and intensity items from each of the 17 PTSD and 3 dissociation items. The CAPS severity scores were used as indicators in a latent profile analysis (LPA) to investigate the existence of a dissociative-PTSD subtype. Subsequently, several covariates were added to the model to explore differences between severe PTSD alone and dissociative-PTSD. Results: The LPA identified five classes: one of which constituted a severe PTSD group (30.5 %), and one of which constituted a dissociative-PTSD group (13.7 %). None of the included, demographic, trauma, or clinical covariates were significantly predictive of membership in the dissociative-PTSD group compared to the severe PTSD group. Conclusions: In conclusion, a significant proportion of individuals report high levels of dissociation alongside their PTSD, which constitutes a dissociative-PTSD subtype. Further investigation is needed to identify which factors may increase or decrease the likelihood of membership in a dissociative-PTSD subtype group compared to a severe PTSD only group.

A growing body of evidence shows that disturbed sleep is more than a secondary symptom of PTSD; it seems to be a core feature. Objectives: This study was carried out to explore subjective and objective sleep disturbances in PTSD patients and the interrelationship between the severity of PTSD and sleep disturbances. Materials and methods: The study was designed as a case-control cross-sectional study, in which 20 patients fulfilling the criteria of PTSD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 4th ed. were recruited from the outpatient psychiatric clinics of the Institute of Psychiatry, Ain Shams University. Patients were selected irrespective of their sex, age between 18 and 45 years, and those who had not received any psychotropic medication 2 weeks before the study. Those with Axis-I comorbidity or any concurrent medical or neurological diseases were excluded. The patient group was compared with a control group which included 10 healthy volunteers matched for age, sex, and social standard selected from among employees of the Institute of Psychiatry, Ain Shams University. All patients were subjected to: (a) general medical and neurological examinations, (b) a Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 4th ed. Axis-I (SCID-I), (c) A PTSD checklist, (d) a Standardized Sleep Questionnaire, and (d) polysomnography (PSG) overnight. The control group completed a General Health Questionnaire to exclude any psychiatric comorbidity and was subjected to a physical examination, SCID-I (nonpatient version), a Standardized Sleep Questionnaire, and polysomnography. Results: Statistical analysis of the data was carried out. The case group was found to have initial insomnia and interrupted sleep; in addition, they experienced nightmares and sleep talking. Sleep latency, sleep efficiency and arousal index were markedly affected in the case group. The study showed that there was a significant increase in both stages I and II non-rapid eye movements sleep, whereas stages III and IV were significantly decreased in patients with PTSD compared to their healthy counterparts. When we compared the two groups with respect to rapid eye movements sleep parameters, respiratory variables of sleep including hypoapnea, respiratory disturbance index, and the desaturation index, we did not find any statistically significant differences. However, the apnea index and periodic leg movements were significantly higher in the PTSD group. Conclusion: Our study showed that patients with PTSD had a disturbed sleep profile characterized by changes affecting non-rapid eye movements sleep parameters, with no marked correlation to the severity of PTSD. Thus, sleep hygiene counseling should be included in all treatment programs for PTSD patients.","sleep patterns in a sample of patients with post-traumatic disorder",0,0

"46",2043,"Introduction: Blast injuries are psychologically and physically devastating. Notably, primary blast injury occurs as a direct effect of changes in atmospheric pressure caused by a blast wave. The combat-related traumatic brain injuries (TBI) resulting from exposure to explosions is highly prevalent among military personnel who have served in current wars. Traumatic brain injury is a common cause of neurological damage and disability among civilians and servicemen. Most patients with TBI suffer a mild traumatic brain injury with transient loss of consciousness. A controversial issue in the field of head injury is the outcome of concussion. Literature findings: Most individuals with such injuries are not admitted to emergency units and receive a variable degree of medical attention. Nevertheless, cranial traumas vary in their mechanisms (blast, fall, road accident, bullet-induced craniocerebral injury) and in their gravity (from minor to severe). The majority of subjects suffering concussion have been exposed to explosion or blast injuries, which have caused minor cranial trauma. Although some authors refuse to accept the reality of post-concussion syndrome (PCS) and confuse it with masked depression, somatic illnesses or post-traumatic stress, we have raised the question again of its existence, without denying the intricate links with other psychiatric or neurological disorders. Although the mortality rate is negligible, the traumatic sequel after mild traumatic brain injury is clear. A difference in initial somatic severity is noted between the serious somatic consequences of a severe cranial trauma compared with the apparently benign consequences of a minor cranial trauma. However, the long-term consequences of the two types of impacts are far from negligible: PCS is a source of morbidity. The prognosis for minor cranial traumas is benign at vital level but a number of patients will develop long-term complaints, which contrast with the negativity of the clinical examination and complementary explorations. The origin of these symptoms questions their organic and psychological aetiologies, which are potentially associated or intricately linked. After a cerebral concussion patients report a cluster of symptoms referred to as postconcussive. Clinical findings: Post-concussion syndrome lies within the confines of somatic symptoms (headaches, dizziness, and fatigue), cognitive symptoms (memory and concentration problems) and affective symptoms (irritability, emotional lability, depression, anxiety, trouble sleeping). The nosographical entity of post-concussion syndrome is still in the process of elaboration following the input of new research intended to determine a cluster of specific symptoms. The persistent post-concussion syndrome is believed to be due to the psychological effects of the injury, biological factors, or a combination of both. Considered in isolation, the symptoms of post-concussion syndrome are non-specific and come together with other diagnostic frameworks such as characterised depressive episodes and post-traumatic stress. Post-concussion syndrome is not specific to concussion but can be present in subjects without any previous cranial trauma. Discussion: Blast trauma can thus be understood as experiencing a shockwave on the brain and as a psycho-traumatic event. The major methodological problem of the studies is the quantification of the functional symptoms present in different nosographical frameworks, which are often co-morbid. Post-traumatic stress disorder is one of several psychiatric disorders that may increase suffering and disability among people with mild traumatic brain injury; in addition mood disorders also seem to be frequent psychiatric complications among these patients. Psychotic disorders after TBI have been associated with several brain regions. The establishment of a causative relationship between TBI and psychiatric disorders is interesting in terms of our understanding of these possible sequelae of TBI. The grey substance of the grey nuclei of the base can also be altered by a cissoring mechanism of the perforating arteries. A cortical contusion through impression of the cortex on the contours of the cranium is frequent. The most common type of injury is traumatic axonal injury. Cerebral lesions that are secondary to TBI associate cell deaths through the mechanisms of apoptosis and necrosis concerning the nerve and glial cells. The scientific objective is to discover an anatomoclinical correlation between the symptoms of post-concussion syndrome and objectifiable brain damage. The predictive value of serum concentrations of the specific serum markers S-100B and neurone specific enolase has been established. Conclusion: Cerebral imaging will allow the mechanisms concerned in cranial trauma to be better understood and thus may allow these mechanisms to be linked with co-morbid post-traumatic psychiatric disorders such as depression. The pyschopathological approach provides supplementary enlightenment where neuroimaging studies struggle to establish precise anatomoclinical correlations between neurotraumatic lesions, state of post-traumatic stress, and PCS. Moving away from a purely scientific view to focus on subjectivity, PCS can establish itself in subjects with no history of head trauma thus showing purely psychic suffering. Is the former name of ""subjective post-head injury syndrome"" no longer pertinent since the neurobiological affections can be objectified? Yet, the latter does not necessarily explain the somatic symptoms. Beyond any opposition of a psychic or somatic causality, it shows the complexity of this interaction. Admittedly, looking for a neuropathological affection is particularly cardinal to propose an aetiological model and objectify the lesions, which should be documented using a forensic approach. However, within the context of treatment, this theoretical division of the brain and the mind becomes less operative: the psychotherapeutic support will on the contrary back the indivisibility of the subject, he/she, who faced the ""clatter"".

"48",1503,"For thousands of years it has been known that aggression as a symptom appears in numerous psychiatric disorders and diseases. During the last decade the appearance of the aggressive behavior related to the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been frequently investigated, often associated with war trauma. The goal of this study is to analyze the impact of alcoholism on a way war veterans suffering from chronic PTSD express and control aggression. The sample included 240 war veterans with chronic PTSD. The subjects were divided in two groups. PTSD group (n=147) and controlled group composed of those suffering from alcoholism in addition to PTSD (n=93). In this study, the following psychological instruments were used: The Harvard trauma questionnaire for PTSD diagnosis (HTQ); the questionnaire for self-evaluation of aggression (STAXI); The Profile Index Emotion (PIE); questionnaire for auto-diagnosis of alcoholism (CAGE). The obtained results indicate that subjects who have PTSD with co-morbid alcoholism are more deprived, aggressive (p < 0.001) and oppositional (p < 0.05) in comparison to subjects whose PTSD is not combined with alcoholism (PIE). The aggression is statistically more expressed in subjects with PTSD who have also been diagnosed with alcoholism on all subscales in comparison to subjects with PTDS who have not been diagnosed with alcoholism: the current state of aggression, the general state of aggression, aggression towards an unfair treatment, aggression directed inwards and outwards (p < 0.001); aggression towards nonspecific provocation and a general way of expressing aggression (p < 0.05) (STAXI).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive narrative intervention for complicated grief (CG) for controlling post-traumatic and depressive issues. The study is a randomised controlled trial and uses the Socio Demographic Questionnaire (SDQ), the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R). There were three phases in the study: (1) The SDQ and CG evaluations were applied to bereaved elders (n = 82). The bereaved elders with the 40 highest ICG values ((greater-than or equal to)25) were randomly allocated into two groups: the intervention group (n = 20) and control group (n = 20); (2) participants were evaluated using the BDI and IES-R and the IG gave informed consent to participate in an intervention with four weekly 60-min sessions addressing recall, emotional and cognitive subjectivation, metaphorisation and projecting. (3) Two months later, the ICG, BDI and IES-R assessments were repeated. Outcome measures showed a statistically significant reduction of CG, depressive and traumatic symptoms compared to the controls.

"55",9757,"Current thinking on what constitutes torture in a detention/interrogation setting focuses solely on particular procedures, without regard for contextual factors that mediate traumatic stress. The present study examined stressor interactions that determined severity and psychological impact of captivity stressors in 432 torture survivors in former Yugoslavia countries and Turkey. A principal components analysis of 46 captivity stressors measured by an Exposure to Torture Scale identified meaningful stressor clusters, which suggested that multiple detention procedures were used in combination to maximize their impact. Perceived torture severity related to 'cruel, inhuman, and degrading' treatments (CIDT) but not to physical torture. Posttraumatic stress disorder related to war-related captivity, deprivation of basic needs, sexual torture, and exposure to extreme temperatures, isolation, and forced stress positions but not to physical torture. CIDT increased posttraumatic stress disorder risk by 71%. Fear- and helplessness-inducing effects of captivity and CIDT appear to be the major determinants of perceived severity of torture and psychological damage in detainees. Considerations on what constitutes torture need to take into account the contextual processes in a captivity setting that mediate these effects. © 2009 American Psychological Association.","a multivariate contextual analysis of torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatments: implications for an evidence-based definition of torture",0,0
"56",2093,"Introduction: Anxiety is a major and frequent symptom of schizophrenia, which is associated with an increased risk of relapse, impaired functioning, lower quality of life and increased incidence of suicide attempts. Despite its clinical relevance, anxiety in schizophrenia remains poorly understood. In the prodromic phase, anxiety indicates a progression towards psychotic decompensation. After a first episode, it is an indicator of relapse. Literature findings: Two approaches have been used to investigate anxiety in schizophrenia: (i) categorical approach (comorbidity of schizophrenia and anxiety disorders) and (ii) dimensional approach (anxiety as a major symptom of the ""dysphoric"" dimension). Clinical categorical studies reported an increased frequency of comorbidity between schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and specific phobia. The dimensional approach proposes that five different factors contribute to the structure of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), with anxiety as a major symptom of the ""dysphoria"" dimension. Concerning diagnosis, it is unclear whether psychotic and neurotic anxiety differs in nature or intensity. Nevertheless, both are frequently opposed. Discussion: Psychotic anxiety is intense, profound and hermetic. In contrast to neurotic anxiety, it is associated with psychomotor disturbances, such as agitation and sideration. There is no specific tool to evaluate anxiety in schizophrenia. The dimensional approach usually runs an evaluation using items or factors extracted from the most widely-used scales, i.e. PANSS or Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) or from anxiety scales developed in non-schizophrenic populations, such as the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Recently, we developed a specific scale for hetero-evaluation (Echelle Anxiete Schizophrenie [EAS scale]). The EAS scale was recently validated and the study of its sensitivity is ongoing. Therapeutical issues: Several studies have examined the effects of antipsychotics on the anxious/depressive cluster extracted from the PANSS, and some other studies have specifically evaluated the effect of antipsychotics on depressive symptoms using the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), but to our knowledge, no study has reported the effect of antipsychotics or other treatment on anxiety when using a schizophrenia-specific scale. There are no specific guideline treatments for anxiety in schizophrenia. Among phenothiazines, cyamemazine is frequently prescribed in France, because of its potent anxiolytic activity and good neurological tolerance. Some authors have suggested a specific treatment with benzodiazepines. However, benzodiazepines should be used with caution, due to undesirable actions such as dependence, rebound and potentiation of certain lateral effects.

"60",1625,"Aim: To determine the relationship between the intensity of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the intensity of predominating symptoms. Method: The study included 151 veterans from 1992-1995 war in Croatia (aged 38.3 (plus or minus) 7.3 years) with PTSD. The veterans were psychologically tested with the Mississippi Scale for Combat-related PTSD (M-PTSD), Questionnaire on Traumatic Combat and War Experiences (USTBI-M), and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-version 201 (MMPI-201). Results: The discriminative analysis of the data revealed that the group with lower PTSD intensity had the highest scores on MMPI scales D (depression, T-score 98.3 (plus or minus) 5.6), Hs (hypochondriasis, 90.1 (plus or minus) 5.1), and Hy (hysteria, 89.5 (plus or minus) 4.9), whereas the group with higher PTSD intensity, besides these three scales (D = 95.7 (plus or minus) 5.3; Hs = 87.6 (plus or minus) 4.3; Hy = 85.6 (plus or minus) 4.7), also had clinically significantly elevated Pt (psychastenia, 80.6 (plus or minus) 5.6), Sc (schizophrenia, 79.6 (plus or minus) 4.8), and Pa (paranoia, 85.6 (plus or minus) 5.4) scales, with the highest Pa scale. Conclusion: It was possible to differentiate study participants with different PTSD intensity on the basis of their MMPI profile. More intense PTSD was associated with externalized symptoms, such as aggression, acting-out, hostility, and mistrust, whereas less intensive PTSD was associated with mostly depressive symptoms.

Method: The study included 151 veterans from 1992-1995 war in Croatia (aged 38.3 ± 7.3 years) with PTSD. The veterans were psychologically tested with the Mississippi Scale for Combat-related PTSD (M-PTSD), Questionnaire on Traumatic Combat and War Experiences (USTBI-M), and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-version 201 (MMPI-201). Results: The discriminative analysis of the data revealed that the group with lower PTSD intensity had the highest scores on MMPI scales D (depression, T-score 98.3 ± 5.6), Hs (hypochondriasis, 90.1 ± 5.1), and Hy (hysteria, 89.5 ± 4.9), whereas the group with higher PTSD intensity, besides these three scales (D = 95.7 ± 5.3; Hs = 87.6 ± 4.3; Hy = 85.6 ± 4.7), also had clinically significantly elevated Pt (psychastenia, 80.6 ± 5.6), Sc (schizophrenia, 79.6 ± 4.8), and Pa (paranoia, 85.6 ± 5.4) scales, with the highest Pa scale. Conclusion: It was possible to differentiate study participants with different PTSD intensity on the basis of their MMPI profile. More intense PTSD was associated with externalized symptoms, such as aggression, acting-out, hostility, and mistrust, whereas less intensive PTSD was associated with mostly depressive symptoms.

"62",1046,"Objective: To explore the relationship between headache trajectory across the first year after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and the development of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) one year post-injury. Design: Secondary analysis of prospectively collected data Setting: Community Participants: 212 prospectively enrolled individuals diagnosed with mTBI Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: PTSD was measured by the PTSD Checklist- Civilian Version (PCL-C). Headache trajectories were determined by headache pain rating within 7 days of injury and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. Results or Clinical Course: Latent Class Trajectory analysis was used to identify 4 trajectories for headache after mTBI: Resolved (early headache that then went away N=28), Worsening (limited early headache with increasing over time N=63), Improving (significant early headache reducing steadily over time N=23), and Chronic (significant headache across time N=100). PTSD was found in 13% of the sample and was significantly associated with having a Chronic headache trajectory with 21 of 25 individuals with PTSD falling in this trajectory. Conclusions: The majority of individuals with mTBI had significant issues with headache over time, with most falling into the Worsening and Chronic trajectories, suggesting that early identification and treatment of headache may be important to change trajectory. In addition, having Chronic headache trajectory across the first year was also significantly associated with PTSD at one year after injury. Additional research is needed to determine how headache pain influences development of PTSD and/or how PTSD contributes to chronicity of headaches.","headache trajectory and the development of post traumatic stress disorder after mild traumatic brain injury",0,0
"63",1185,"Objectives. The study examined the long-term course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by analyzing rates of recurrence and the predictive value of comorbid psychiatric disorders and psychosocial functioning. Methods. This study is based on diagnostic assessments administered at intake and subsequent follow-up interviews over a period of 15 years in a sample of 90 anxiety-disordered patients with comorbid PTSD who participated in the Harvard Brown Anxiety Research project (HARP). KaplanMeier life table analysis revealed a 0.20 probability of full remission during the 15 years of follow-up. Results. Latent growth model (LGM) analysis revealed that the number of trauma exposures was a predictor of a worse course of PTSD but only during some intervals of the 15-year follow-up. Subjects with full social phobia were more likely to experience worsening of PTSD over time in comparison with subjects with less severe social phobia. Role functioning in the areas of household and employment was a significant predictor of a declining course of PTSD. Conclusions. These findings revealed the dynamic nature of the predictive value of traumatic experiences, the deleterious effect of social phobia and the long term effect of psychosocial functioning on the course of PTSD.

"67",944,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to define self-embedding behavior (SEB), develop a clinical profile of adolescents who engage in SEB, and emphasize the importance of rapid, targeted, and effective identification and intervention. METHODS: As part of a retrospective study with a database evaluating 600 patients percutaneously treated for soft-tissue foreign body removal, adolescents were identified with self-embedded soft-tissue foreign bodies. We describe patients' gender, age, and psychiatric diagnoses; SEB age of onset, frequency, and self-reported reasons; and the number, type, location of, and removal technique for objects. RESULTS: Eleven patients (9 females) who engaged in SEB were identified. Ten of the 11 patients were members of a group home or psychiatric facility at the time they engaged in SEB. All patients had previous and multiple psychiatric diagnoses. SEB mean age-of-onset was 16 years, and mean number of SEB episodes per patient was 1.9. The most common self-reported purpose for SEB was suicidal ideation (6 of 8 [75%]) versus nonsuicidal ideation (2 of 8 [25%]), with 3 cases lacking this documentation. The mean number of objects embedded in a single episode was 2.4, usually composed of metal and embedded in the arm. Seventy-six foreign bodies were percutaneously removed (using ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance), including metal, glass, wood, plastic, graphite, and crayon. CONCLUSIONS: SEB is an extreme form of self-injury requiring aggressive and timely interdisciplinary assessment and treatment. An understanding of SEB allows medical professionals to pursue rapid, targeted, and effective intervention to interrupt the cycle of self-harm and institute appropriate long-term therapy.

The current study is aimed at identifying 'burnout' and 'compassion fatigue' among clinicians involved in care of individuals suffering from medical illness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 clinicians were included in the study. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to gather information related to personal, professional, anthropometric, and metabolic profile of the study participants. Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQoL Version V) was used to assess burnout, compassion satisfaction and secondary traumatic stress. Analysis was carried out using the SPSS version 19.0. RESULTS: The mean age of clinicians was 46.68+/-11.06 (range 26-67 years). Burnout score was significantly higher in those involved in diabetology practice. Similarly, compassion satisfaction score was greater among those with greater years of practice as well as among those in private practice. Clinicians who reported a poor working condition, as opposed to good, had more burnout and less compassion satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that it is important to find out ways of decreasing burnout and compassion fatigue among clinicians.","compassion fatigue and burnout amongst clinicians: a medical exploratory study",0,0

The present survey aimed at examining the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other disorders and symptoms, all present in old age, as long-term consequences of politically motivated violence in a comparison design. METHODS: A group of former political detainees (N = 59, mean age 73.5 years) who had been arrested by the Romanian communist regime were compared to an age- and gender-matched control group (N = 39). PTSD was assessed using a structured clinical interview (CIDI). The investigation of the clinical profile was further accomplished by self-rating measures for anxiety, depression, and health-related functioning, as well as by clinician-administrated interviews for substance abuse, dissociation, and somatization symptoms. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 54%. In the case of participants left untreated, PTSD persisted, often over four decades, such that current PTSD was diagnosed still in a third of the survivors. Other clinical conditions such as somatization, substance abuse, dissociative disorders, and major depression were also common among the former political detainees and often associated with current PTSD.

"73",11927,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an increasingly recognized and potentially preventable condition. Certain factors, especially the severity of the trauma, perceived lack of social support and peri-traumatic dissociation have been associated with its development. In recent years, a more robust evidence base regarding the management of individuals involved in traumatic events has emerged. Immediately after a traumatic event, simple practical, pragmatic support provided in a sympathetic manner by non-mental health professionals seems most likely to help. For individuals who develop persisting PTSD, trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCBT) may be beneficial within a few months of the trauma. For those who develop chronic PTSD, TFCBT and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing are best supported by the current evidence. Some anti-depressants appear to have a modest beneficial effect and are recommended as a second-line treatment. The current evidence base has allowed the development of guidelines that now require implementation. This has major implications in terms of planning and developing services that allow appropriately qualified and trained individuals to be available to cater adequately for the needs of survivors of traumatic events.

A consensus of the literature suggests that when there is a dysfunction in the brain reward cascade, which could be caused by certain genetic variants (polygenic), especially in the DA system causing a hypodopaminergic trait, the brain of that person requires a DA fix to feel good.

Method: The sample consisted of US military service members in all branches including active duty, reserve and national guard who deployed once (n = 3393) or multiple times (n = 4394). Self-reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress were obtained prior to deployment and at two follow-ups spaced 3 years apart.

"82",1338,"Objective Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and disabling condition following a traumatic event. Despite its high prevalence rates, relatively little is known about the manifestation and course of the disorder in older adults. Moreover, there has been little evaluation of the efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatment approaches for older patients. Design This overview aims to summarize available data on the prevalence and symptoms of late-life PTSD and to review the current treatment approaches for older adults. Results The course and severity of PTSD symptoms in older adults depend on the time the trauma occurred (early versus late life). In the case of acute traumatization, lower prevalence rates and symptom severities are generally observed in older than in younger populations. In the case of early-life traumatization, a decline in PTSD symptom severity can be observed over the life course. Research on treatment approaches has produced promising results, indicating that disorder-specific interventions (i.e., trauma confrontation and cognitive restructuring) can be effectively combined with an age-specific narrative life-review approach. Conclusion Given the limited empirical evidence, caution is warranted in generalizing the reported findings.

"83",762,"Objective Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and disabling condition following a traumatic event. Despite its high prevalence rates, relatively little is known about the manifestation and course of the disorder in older adults. Moreover, there has been little evaluation of the efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatment approaches for older patients. Design This overview aims to summarize available data on the prevalence and symptoms of late-life PTSD and to review the current treatment approaches for older adults. Results The course and severity of PTSD symptoms in older adults depend on the time the trauma occurred (early versus late life). In the case of acute traumatization, lower prevalence rates and symptom severities are generally observed in older than in younger populations. In the case of early-life traumatization, a decline in PTSD symptom severity can be observed over the life course. Research on treatment approaches has produced promising results, indicating that disorder-specific interventions (i.e., trauma confrontation and cognitive restructuring) can be effectively combined with an age-specific narrative life-review approach. Conclusion Given the limited empirical evidence, caution is warranted in generalizing the reported findings. Nevertheless, it is possible to draw a number of conclusions concerning the characteristics and treatment of PTSD in older adults. Further research is needed to better understand the various presentations of PTSD in late life and to validate and improve the effectiveness of available treatment approaches.

"84",5877,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of life in Croatian homeland war veterans who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic low back pain (LBP). METHODS: A total of 369 participants were included, classified in four study groups: those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; N = 59), those with both PTSD and lower back pain (PTSD+LBP; N = 80), those with isolated LBP (N = 95) and controls (N = 135). WHOQOL-BREF survey was used in the estimation of quality of life. The data were analysed using statistical methods and hierarchical clustering. RESULTS: The results indicated a general pattern of lowering quality of life in participants with both psychological (PTSD) and physical (LBP) burden. The average overall quality of life was 2.82 +/- 1.14 for the PTSD+LBP group, 3.29 +/- 1.28 for the PTSD group, 4.04 +/- 1.25 for the LBP group and 4.48 +/- 0.80 for the controls (notably, all the pair-wise comparisons were significantly different at the level of P < 0.001, except for the pair LBP-controls, which was insignificant). This result indicated that quality of life was reduced for 9.9% in patients with LBP, 26.6% in patients with PTSD and 37.1% in PTSD+LBP, suggesting strong synergistic effect of PTSD and LBP. The analysis also identified several clusters of participants with different pattern of quality of life related outcomes, reflecting the complex nature of this indicator. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study reiterate strong impact of PTSD on quality of life, which is additionally reduced if the patient also suffers from LBP. PTSD remains a substantial problem in Croatia, nearly two decades after the beginning of the 1991-1996 Homeland war.","quality of life in croatian homeland war (1991-1995) veterans who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain",0,0

"87",1675,"Aim: To assess the effectiveness of the long-term group psychotherapy in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in war veterans on the basis of clinical picture of PTSD, associated neurotic symptoms, and adopted models of psychological defense mechanisms. Methods: Prospective cohort study involved 59 war veterans who participated in dynamic-oriented supportive group psychotherapy for five years. The groups met once a week for 90 minutes. Forty-two veterans finished the program. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale structured interview was used to assess the intensity of PTSD. Crown-Crisp Index was used to evaluate other neurotic symptoms, and Life Style Questionnaire was used to assess the defense mechanisms. The assessments were done at the beginning of psychotherapy, after the second, and after the fifth year of treatment. Comorbid diagnoses, hospitalizations, and outpatient clinic treatments were also recorded. Results: Long-term group psychotherapy reduced the intensity of PTSD symptoms in our patients (the difference between Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale score at the beginning and the end of treatment, F = 9.103, P = 0.001). Other neurotic symptoms and the characteristic profile of defense mechanisms did not change significantly during the course of treatment. Predominant defense mechanisms were projection (M = 82.0 (plus or minus) 14.4) and displacement (M = 69.0 (plus or minus) 16.8). None of the symptoms or defense mechanisms present at the beginning of the treatment changed significantly after two or five years of treatment. The number of diagnosed major depressive episodes, which increased after the second year of psychotherapy, decreased by the end of treatment. Conclusion: Psychotherapy can reduce the intensity of PTSD symptoms, but the changes in the personality of veterans with PTSD are deeply rooted. Traumatic experiences lead to the formation of rigid defense mechanisms, which cannot be significantly changed by long-term group psychotherapy.","long-term dynamic-oriented group psychotherapy of posttraumatic stress disorder in war veterans: prospective study of five-year treatment",0,0

"89",11856,"(from the chapter) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety condition that has attracted much attention in recent years. Much of this interest arises from the need to understand how people respond to terrorism, war, and other forms of trauma. Equally important is the recognition that PTSD offers insight into human fear because it exemplifies extreme fear reactions. This chapter reviews the course of psychological adaptation after trauma, describes the major models of PTSD, outlines the evidence for these models, and discusses treatment options for the disorder. PTSD, perhaps more than any other anxiety disorder, has often been associated with practices that lack scientific rigor. Recognizing the need for evidence-based understanding and management of PTSD, this chapter aims to synthesize our current knowledge that is based on sound scientific study of people affected by trauma.

"90",12392,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic injuries affect millions of patients each year, and resulting post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) significantly contributes to subsequent impairment. AIMS: To map the distinctive long-term trajectories of PTSD responses over 6 years by using latent growth mixture modelling. METHOD: Randomly selected injury patients (n = 1084) admitted to four hospitals around Australia were assessed in hospital, and at 3, 12, 24 and 72 months. Lifetime psychiatric history and current PTSD severity and funxctioning were assessed. RESULTS: Five trajectories of PTSD response were noted across the 6 years: (a) chronic (4%), (b) recovery (6%), (c) worsening/recovery (8%), (d) worsening (10%) and (e) resilient (73%). A poorer trajectory was predicted by female gender, recent life stressors, presence of mild traumatic brain injury and admission to intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the long-term PTSD effects that can occur following traumatic injury. The different trajectories highlight that monitoring a subset of patients over time is probably a more accurate means of identifying PTSD rather than relying on factors that can be assessed during hospital admission.","trajectory of post-traumatic stress following traumatic injury: 6-year follow-up",1,1

More robust biopsychosocial models regard the course of AD as a dialectical interplay of neuropathological and psychosocial influences. Drawing on this broader conceptualization, we conducted an extensive review of empirical and theoretical literature on the associations of trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and AD to develop a working model that conceptualizes the role of psychosocial stressors and physiological mechanisms in the onset and course of AD. The proposed model suggests two pathways. In the first, previous life trauma acts as a risk factor for later-life onset of AD, either directly or mediated by PTSD or PTSD correlates. In the second, de novo AD experiential trauma is associated with accelerated cognitive decline, either directly or mediated through PTSD or PTSD correlates. Evidence synthesized in this paper indicates that previous life trauma and PTSD are strong candidates as psychosocial risk factors for AD and warrant further empirical scrutiny. Psychosocial and neurological-based intervention implications are discussed. A biopsychosocial approach has the capacity to enhance understanding of individual AD trajectories, moving the field toward 'person-centered' models of care.","broadening the etiological discourse on alzheimer's disease to include trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder as psychosocial risk factors",0,0

However, those surveyed within 3 to 6 months of homecoming reported significantly greater symptoms than those surveyed after 6 months. Five percent of subjects were found to have clinically diagnostic levels of PTSD symptoms 6 months after homecoming. Individuals who expressed difficulty discussing their experiences with more than one person also showed significantly higher PTSD scores.

"101",6443,"CONTEXT: More than 2 decades of conflict have led to widespread human suffering and population displacement in Afghanistan. In 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other collaborating partners performed a national population-based mental health survey in Afghanistan. OBJECTIVE: To provide national estimates of mental health status of the disabled (any restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in the manner considered normal for a human being) and nondisabled Afghan population aged at least 15 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A national multistage, cluster, population-based mental health survey of 799 adult household members (699 nondisabled and 100 disabled respondents) aged 15 years or older conducted from July to September 2002. Fifty district-level clusters were selected based on probability proportional to size sampling. One village was randomly selected in each cluster and 15 households were randomly selected in each village, yielding 750 households. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographics, social functioning as measured by selected questions from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, depressive symptoms measured by the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25, trauma events and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) measured by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, and culture-specific symptoms of mental illness and coping mechanisms. RESULTS: A total of 407 respondents (62.0%) reported experiencing at least 4 trauma events during the previous 10 years. The most common trauma events experienced by the respondents were lack of food and water (56.1%) for nondisabled persons and lack of shelter (69.7%) for disabled persons. The prevalence of respondents with symptoms of depression was 67.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.6%-80.7%) and 71.7% (95% CI, 65.0%-78.4%), and symptoms of anxiety 72.2% (95% CI, 63.8%-80.7%) and 84.6% (95% CI, 74.1%-95.0%) for nondisabled and disabled respondents, respectively. The prevalence of symptoms of PTSD was similar for both groups (nondisabled, 42.1%; 95% CI, 34.2%-50.1%; and disabled, 42.2%; 95% CI, 29.2%-55.2%). Women had significantly poorer mental health status than men did. Respondents who were disabled had significantly lower social functioning and poorer mental health status than those who were nondisabled. Feelings of hatred were high (84% of nondisabled and 81% of disabled respondents). Coping mechanisms included religious and spiritual practices; focusing on basic needs, such as higher income, better housing, and more food; and seeking medical assistance. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationally representative survey of Afghans, prevalence rates of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD were high. These data underscore the need for donors and health care planners to address the current lack of mental health care resources, facilities, and trained mental health care professionals in Afghanistan.","mental health, social functioning, and disability in postwar afghanistan",0,0

Methods: Electronic database searches were conducted to identify research articles focusing on cognitive impairments in depressive or anxiety disorders among young adults published in English during years 1990-2006. Results: Cognitive impairments are common in young adults with major depression and anxiety disorders, although their nature remains partly unclear.

The profile of cognitive dysfunction seems to depend on anxiety disorder subtype, but at least obsessive-compulsive disorder is associated with deficits in executive functioning and visual memory. The conflicting results may be explained by heterogeneity within study participants, such as illness status, comorbid mental disorders, and medication, and other methodological issues, including inadequate matching of study groups and varying testing procedures.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey design was used and women with breast cancer (N=170) were recruited. MEASURES: Attentional biases, cancer-related ruminations, PTSD symptoms, and PTG were assessed. RESULTS: Negative attentional bias and negative cancer-related rumination were positively related to PTSD symptoms following cancer diagnosis and treatments, but they were not related to PTG. Positive attentional bias and positive cancer-related rumination were positively related to PTG, but positive attentional bias was not related to PTSD symptoms. Findings showed that negative cancer-related rumination partially mediated the relationship between negative attentional bias and PTSD symptoms, while positive cancer-related rumination partially mediated the relationship between positive attentional bias and PTG. CONCLUSION: Findings support that there are differential trajectories to PTSD symptoms and PTG with respect to different valence of habitual attentional style and cancer-related rumination. They may serve as potential therapeutic leverages in the alleviation of PTSD symptoms and facilitation of PTG following cancer diagnosis and treatments.","the valence of attentional bias and cancer-related rumination in posttraumatic stress and posttraumatic growth among women with breast cancer",0,0

Results: Negative attentional bias and negative cancer-related rumination were positively related to PTSD symptoms following cancer diagnosis and treatments, but they were not related to PTG. Positive attentional bias and positive cancer-related rumination were positively related to PTG, but positive attentional bias was not related to PTSD symptoms. Findings showed that negative cancer-related rumination partially mediated the relationship between negative attentional bias and PTSD symptoms, while positive cancer-related rumination partially mediated the relationship between positive attentional bias and PTG. Conclusion: Findings support that there are differential trajectories to PTSD symptoms and PTG with respect to different valence of habitual attentional style and cancer-related rumination. They may serve as potential therapeutic leverages in the alleviation of PTSD symptoms and facilitation of PTG following cancer diagnosis and treatments.

"108",6037,"OBJECTIVES: Topiramate, a structurally novel anticonvulsant, is being evaluated for other neurological conditions such as migraine, neuropathic pain, and essential tremor, and also for psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder, bulimia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and schizoaffective disorder, in addition to obesity. This article will focus on the use of topiramate for bipolar disorder. METHODS: The pharmacological profile of topiramate is compared to other established and putative mood stabilizers, and a rationale for its use in bipolar disorder is presented. Data from open clinical trials of topiramate for depression, mania, and rapid-cycling bipolar disorder are summarized. Preliminary data from one pilot dose-finding, double-blind, random-assignment, placebo-controlled, 3-week parallel group study of two doses of topiramate for acute bipolar I mania is reported. Safety data regarding topiramate was reviewed. Finally, the potential place of this agent in bipolar illness is considered. RESULTS: The pharmacological advantages for topiramate are low protein binding, minimal hepatic metabolism and mainly unchanged renal excretion, a 24-h half-life, and minimal drug interactions. Open clinical studies suggest a 50-65% response for refractory bipolar mania, and a 40-56% response for refractory bipolar depression in mainly add-on treatment. Open clinical studies of topiramate for rapid-cycling subjects and those for comorbid bulimia, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress, migraine, and obesity report effectiveness. The primary efficacy endpoint data (change from baseline Y-MRS total scores) of the placebo-controlled, random assignment parallel group phase II dose-finding study were not statistically significant. However, once the antidepressant-associated manias (28 of the sample, of 97 subjects) were excluded from the controlled study, the post-hoc analyses indicated the higher dose (512 mg/day) topiramate treatment group showed a statistically significant reduction in endpoint Y-MRS change scores as compared to placebo (p < 0.03). Adverse effects of topiramate in bipolar subjects include attention, concentration and memory problems, fatigue, sedation, transient paraesthesias, nausea, and anorexia. Some subjects experience word-finding difficulty. Weight loss may be seen in several topiramate-treated subjects with bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Topiramate appears to show promise as an addition to the agents available to treat bipolar disorder. More definitive controlled data on the efficacy of topiramate in the acute and continuation phases as well as for the prophylaxis either as monotherapy or as combination treatment of bipolar disorder are ongoing, and the results are awaited.","the evolving role of topiramate among other mood stabilizers in the management of bipolar disorder",0,0

Equally, there has been an enormous increase in the quantity of research output over the last decade and considerable progress has been made. The last five years, in particular, have seen a growth in the number of well-conducted, treatment outcome studies such that there is now a strong evidence base from which to recommend cognitive-behavioural interventions as the psychological treatment of choice for PTSD. It is to be hoped that the next decade will see further development and refinement of effective treatments to better manage the mental health effects of trauma and to reduce the human and financial costs associated with post-traumatic mental health problems.

"129",58,"This study examined the association between somatic complaints and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in treatment-seeking Canadian military personnel with military-related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Current and former Canadian Forces (CF) members attending the Parkwood Hospital Operational Stress Injury Clinic in London, Ontario (N=291) were administered self-report questionnaires assessing number and severity of somatic complaints, PTSD and depressive symptom severity, and mental and physical health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) prior to commencing treatment. Regression analyses were used to identify the role of somatic complaints on physical and mental HR-QoL, after controlling for PTSD symptom cluster and depressive symptom severity. Somatic symptom severity accounted for only a small amount of the variance in mental HR-QoL after accounting for PTSD symptom cluster and depressive symptom severity, but accounted for a larger proportion of the variance in physical HR-QoL after accounting for PTSD cluster and depressive symptom severity. Understanding the role of somatization in the symptom-presentation of military personnel with PTSD may provide additional avenues for treatment with this population. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","somatic symptoms and health-related quality of life among treatment-seeking canadian forces personnel with ptsd",0,0

Female population, age, duration of PNES, psychiatric institutionalization, psychopharmacotherapy, dissociative disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), were significantly higher in the pure PNES patients. Suicide attempts, antiepileptic therapy, conversive, affective and personality disorders were frequent in both groups. In the analysis of seizure semiology, the total lack of responsiveness was significantly higher in the mixed PNES group. Conclusions: Pure PNES patients showed similarities and differences in the psychiatric profile, with a greater prevalence of dissociative disorders and PTSD, factors related to psychiatric severity.

"132",5957,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with personality impairments involving externalized and internalized psychopathology. This study has explored the association between PTSD symptoms as consequences of prolonged torture experiences or early childhood trauma exposure and personality traits. METHOD: One hundred and sixty-one men were included: 36 Iraqi men refugees (mean age = 43.9, SD = 8.7) who had longstanding torture experiences as adults; 42 Swedish prisoners (mean age = 33.8, SD = 7), with early childhood trauma exposure; 31 Arab men refugees (mean age = 41.8, SD = 8.9) without self-reported torture or violence experiences; 52 non-traumatized Swedish males (mean age = 39.3, SD = 5.5). They were assessed for symptoms of PTSD or PTSD hypothetical clusters. Personality profile was assessed by the Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP). Factor analysis with varimax rotation was conducted and yielded three factors: externalized, internalized and avoidance domains. RESULTS: Individuals who suffered prolonged torture experiences or had early childhood trauma exposure showed impaired personality profiles in internalized and externalized domains. Individuals with or without PTSD showed significant differences p < 0.05 concerning: internalized, externalized and avoidance. ANOVA and post-hoc analysis according to Scheffe showed that the prolonged torture group > early childhood trauma exposure > nontraumatized group. CONCLUSION: Prolonged torture experiences or early trauma exposure may impair personality formation by enhancing the effects of cognitive, affective and behavioural vulnerabilities.","trauma, ptsd and personality: the relationship between prolonged traumatization and personality impairments",0,0

A newer serotonergic compound, nefazodone, has a different side-effect profile, thus making it a potentially promising compound to study. Seventeen private practice patients with PTSD were treated with nefazodone up to 600 mg/day for a maximum total treatment period of 12 weeks. All subjects were civilians, and were monitored for efficacy and side-effects at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12. Nefazodone was associated with statistically significant improvement in mean scores on all six rating scales used to assess change from baseline in PTSD symptoms. Additionally, statistically significant improvement from baseline were seen for the intrusive, avoidant/numbing, and hyperarousal clusters on a global PTSD scale. Early improvements in nightmares and general sleep disturbance were observed. Overall, there was a 43% response rate at endpoint, or 60% in treatment completers, by observer rating. Side-effects (assessed on the Medication Effects Scale) were generally benign. Nefazodone was associated with clinical improvement in this population, and now needs to be studied in double-blind, placebo controlled, protocols.","treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder with nefazodone",0,0

"138",1689,"We conducted a follow-up assessment to assess the development of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression among Chinese immigrants after the World Trade Center attack. Sixty-five Chinese displaced workers who were originally interviewed in May 2002 were re-interviewed in March 2003. Whereas depression scores decreased over time, average PTSD scores remained unchanged. The trajectory of posttraumatic stress symptoms was more complex, with an increasing number of individuals who show no or little emotional health problems and another increasing group of individuals with exacerbated posttraumatic stress symptoms. Although the mean values of the re-experiencing and hypervigilance cluster did not change over time, the mean value of the avoidance/numbing cluster increased significantly from time 1 (M = 4.60, SD = 4.98) to time 2 (M = 6.34, SD = 4.24), (F1.61 = 5.69, P = .02).

"140",10315,"Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats exhibit hyperresponsive neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to stress that exceed normal controls and are especially prone to develop stress-induced depressive disorder. Pharmacological studies indicate altered serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) systems functioning in WKY rats, yet no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive assessment of the neurochemical profile for WKY rats as compared to the outbred progenitor controls, Wistar rats. To this end, male, WKY and Wistar rats (N=6/group) were exposed to an acute forced-swim stress or were left untreated as controls. The prefrontal cortex (PFCtx), striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAS), and amygdala were assayed for levels of NE, DA and 5-HT, as well as major metabolites, by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. In a separate experiment, designed to assess baseline and stress-induced neuroendocrine activation, male, Wistar and WKY rats (N=6/group) were exposed to an acute forced-swim stress of 15 min or were left untreated as controls. Animals were killed immediately after the test (T=0), 30 min after the test (T=30) or 60 min after the test (T=60), and control animals were killed immediately after weighing. After decapitation, trunk blood was collected and plasma was isolated by centrifugation and analyzed for corticosterone by immunoassay. The neurochemical results demonstrate distinct patterns of baseline and stress-induced monoamine turnover in WKY rats, including alterations to DA and 5-HT turnovers in prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, two critical brain areas implicated in anxiety, depression and drug reward. The neuroendocrine results indicate that WKY rats exhibited a sustained corticosterone response to acute stress, as compared to Wistar controls. Overall, these data are predicted to be useful for understanding the anxiety- and depressive-like behavioral phenotype exhibited by these animals and for increased understanding of the role genetic background in altering neurochemical function. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) is a self-report measure largely used to evaluate the presence of PTSD. Objective: To investigate the internal consistency, temporal reliability and factor validity of the Portuguese language version of the PCL used in Brazil. Methods: A total of 186 participants were recruited. The sample was heterogeneous with regard to occupation, sociodemographic data, mental health history, and exposure to traumatic events. Subjects answered the PCL at two occasions within a 15 days' interval (range: 5-15 days). Results: Cronbach's alpha coefficients indicated high internal consistency for the total scale (0.91) and for the theoretical dimensions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) (0.83, 0.81, and 0.80). Temporal reliability (test-retest) was high and consistent for different cutoffs. Maximum likelihood exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted and oblique rotation (Promax) was applied. The Kaiser- Meyer-Olkin (KMO) index (0.911) and Bartlett's test of sphericity (2 = 1,381.34, p < 0.001) indicated that correlation matrices were suitable for factor analysis. The analysis yielded three symptom clusters which accounted for 48.9% of the variance, namely, intrusions, avoidance, and numbing-hyperarousal.

"144",4179,"Objectives: The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence, as well as the clinical, cognitive, and functional correlates of psychiatric comorbidity in patients with delusional disorder (DD). Methods: Eighty-six outpatients with DSM-IV DD were evaluated for psychiatric comorbidity on Axis I disorders using the Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview (MINI). The following instruments were administered: the Standardized Assessment of Personality (SAP), the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a neuropsychological battery (consisting of measures for attention, verbal and working memory, and executive functions), the Sheehan Disability Inventory (SDI), and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale. A socio-demographic and clinical questionnaire was also completed. Results: Forty-six percent of the subjects had at least one additional lifetime psychiatric diagnosis, the most common being depressive disorders (N = 16, 32.6%), followed by anxiety disorders (N = 8, 14%). DD with comorbid Axis I disorders (N = 40, 46.5%) was associated with a specific syndromic constellation (more common cluster C personality psychopathology, somatic delusions, olfactory and gustatory hallucinations, and suicide risk), and greater severity of the psychopathology, particularly as regards emotional dysregulation (total and general PANSS scales, MADRS, and perceived stress SDI scoring). In contrast, DD without psychiatric comorbidity ""pure"" DD (N = 46, 53.5%) was associated with worse overall neurocognitive performance, mainly in working memory.

This book comes as the National Clinical Practice Guideline No. 26, and was commissioned by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. A guidelines development group, including some international experts on PTSD, worked together to produce this. In this era of evidence-based medicine, this work on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is very welcome. It fulfils a major need in the field. As so many different approaches have been offered for the treatment of PTSD, clear guidelines of what works - and therefore what the clients should be offered - were badly needed. Here the experts have reviewed the evidence and given their verdict. Cognitive-behaviour therapy is the first line of recommended treatment. Eye Movement Densensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) is also recommended. There are also useful comments on various issues related to PTSD treatment.

"147",2208,"The hepatitis C virus is a major public health problem. The prevalence of serum antibodies to the hepatitis C virus in the world is estimated at 3% of the population. Although the incidence of new infection is declining, a large asymptomatic population with chronic hepatitis C exists. This infection often affects persons with psychiatric and substance use problems. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are commonly associated with chronic hepatitis C virus infection, and its treatment by interferon-alpha. During hepatitis C infection, discomfort, fatigue, and depressive symptoms are frequently reported, before IFN-a treatment. Many side effects are reported during the IFN-a treatment. Neuropsychiatric symptoms frequently occur in hepatitis C patients treated with IFN-a. These side effects are troublesome and frequently account for dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. These symptoms include cognitive, affective, and behavioural components. The cognitive changes include impaired concentration, decreased alertness, deficits in verbal memory and mental slowing. These cognitive changes can be related to the IFN-a treatment or to the action of the hepatitis C virus on the brain. Depression is the most common psychiatric side effect. The reported rates of depressive symptoms range from 10 to 40%. The rates are higher in studies that used specific tools to assess for depression and in prospective studies. Depressive symptoms associated to the IFN-a treatment are particular: irritability, emotional lability, insomnia, behavioural disorders, impulsivity, fatigue, loss of interest. Occasional cases of mania and psychosis have been reported. There have been reports of anxiety disorders, including phobias, obsessive thoughts and rituals, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Several studies have shown that patients with chronic hepatitis C have a reduced quality of life. The impact of IFN-a is not clear. The quality of life may be related to the cognitive change or to the stage of the liver disease according to the authors. A large study showed that successful therapy with IFN-a improves quality of life. Studies of mechanisms of IFN-a neuropsychiatric effects are preliminary, so theories remain speculative. IFN-a may directly affect the central nervous system and affects neuroendocrine, cytokine, and neurotransmitter pathways. Identification and treatment of chronic hepatitis C infections are likely to become more aggressive with the improved prognosis offered by combination therapy (IFN-a and ribavirin). Psychiatrists will increasingly be involved in the care of such patients. Psychiatrists are often involved in the care of intravenous drug users and alcoholics, both of whom have high rates of hepatitis C infection. Depression may also be the visible symptom of a chronic hepatitis C infection, early detection of hepatitis C might lead to secondary prevention and improved outcomes. Recognition of depression associated to IFN-a is important, for treatment and for the possibility of improving adherence to IFN-a. The nature and severity of the neuropsychiatric adverse effects are, in part, dose dependent, though there is significant variability. No risk factor of psychiatric effects is clearly identified. All patients who receive interferon should be considered at some risk of developing neuropsychiatric adverse effects. Baseline assessments of mood and cognitive functions will help the clinician determine if behavioural symptoms are interferon-related. In clinical practice, SSRIs appear to be used commonly and to be helpful. The choice of therapy is based on the visible mood symptoms and the adverse effect profile of the antidepressants. The antidepressants drugs recommended are citalopram, sertraline, tianeptine, milnacipram and viloxazine. The efficacy of prophylactic antidepressant treatment is a matter of clinical debate. Non-pharmacological interventions are also useful. Education regarding the possible neuropsychiatric changes secondary to interferon treatment may prepare patients and make earlier interventions possible. Improved understanding of the mechanisms of neuro-psychiatric symptoms and their treatment may help patients with chronic hepatitis C sustain treatment, which will ultimately prolong their life and improve their quality of life. Research should include patients with psychiatric problems so that they are not excluded from effective treatments for hepatitis C. (copyright) 2005 Elsevier SAS.

Results are discussed with respect to the typical posttraumatic stress symptoms following the earthquake. © The Author(s) 2013.","posttraumatic reactions to an earthquake: multidimensional scaling profile analysis of adolescent survivors",0,0
"151",7380,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were (a) to assess negative affectivity and posttraumatic symptomatology in mothers following the diagnosis of cancer in their children; (b) to examine sociodemographic and psychosocial variables associated with change in distress over time; and (c) to identify distinct subgroups of mothers whose patterns and trajectories of adjustment can be distinguished according to available predictor data. METHODS: Two hundred and twelve mothers at seven sites were assessed just following their child's diagnosis, and again 3 months and 6 months later. Primary outcomes included measures of mood disturbance, depressive symptoms, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress. RESULTS: Overall, mothers demonstrated a pattern of mildly elevated negative affectivity and posttraumatic symptomatology initially, with steady improvements evident at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Distinct adjustment trajectories were evident within the sample as a whole, indicating subgroups of mothers with high-declining, moderate-stable, and low-stable distress levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight considerable resilience among mothers facing the stress of childhood cancer. Intervention efforts aimed at reducing maternal distress might best be targeted towards the subgroup of mothers who may be predicted to exhibit the highest level of distress.","trajectories of adjustment in mothers of children with newly diagnosed cancer: a natural history investigation",0,0

"153",7164,"OBJECTIVE: Complex posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) involves a variety of personality disturbances presumed to result from repeated interpersonal trauma such as child abuse. As Complex PTSD patients are a heterogeneous population, we searched for clinically relevant personality-based subtypes. METHOD: This study used a cluster analysis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), Axis II features within a sample of 71 female outpatients with systematically assessed child abuse-related Complex PTSD. RESULTS: Two main subtypes were found: adaptive and nonadaptive. The latter was further differentiated into withdrawn, alienated, suffering, and aggressive subtypes, characterized by different levels of introversion and disinhibition. Among the nonadaptive subtypes, the severity of Complex PTSD symptoms was lowest in the withdrawn (introverted only) subtype. The subtypes differed in their level of dissociation and depression but did not differ regarding PTSD symptoms, trauma history, or parental bonding characteristics. CONCLUSION: Confirming earlier findings, our study found personality-based Complex PTSD subtypes, which could implicate differential treatment needs and results.","clinical phenomenology of childhood abuse-related complex ptsd in a population of female patients: patterns of personality disturbance",0,0

"155",7149,"BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress (PTS) disorder after injury is a significant yet underaddressed issue in the trauma care setting. Parental anxiety may impact a child's risk of future, persistent PTS symptoms after injury. This study aimed to: (1) identify injury incident and demographic variables related to a positive screen for future, persistent PTS symptoms in children; and (2) examine the relationship between parental anxiety and a positive screen for future, persistent PTS symptoms in children. METHODS: From November 2009 to August 2010, 124 patients were enrolled at a pediatric trauma center. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age 7 years to 17 years; (2) hospitalized for at least 24 hours after physical trauma; and (3) English or Spanish speaking. State and trait anxiety were measured for both pediatric patients and their parents/guardians via the state trait anxiety inventory for children and state trait anxiety inventory, respectively. Risk for future, persistent PTS, among pediatric patients was assessed via the screening tool for early predictor of posttraumatic stress disorder (STEPP). RESULTS: Of 116 participants assessed via the STEPP, 32 (28%) screened positive for risk of future, persistent PTS symptoms. Motor vehicle collision and parental presence at injury were associated with a positive STEPP screen. The effect of parental presence on positive STEPP screen was modified by parental trait anxiety. Children of anxious parents present at injury were over 14 times as likely to screen positive for risk of future, persistent PTS, as those without a parent present. CONCLUSION: The risk of future, persistent PTS, after injury among the pediatric population is substantial. Parents with existing trait anxiety are shown to influence their child's risk for future, persistent PTS, particularly if present at the injury event. Further study of PTS prevention and control strategies are needed among this population within the trauma care setting.

"166",11028,"Background: The associations between childhood abuse and subsequent criminality and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are well known. However, a major limitation of research related to childhood abuse and its effects is the focus on one particular type of abuse at the expense of others. Recent work has established that childhood abuse rarely occurs as a unidimensional phenomenon. Therefore, a number of studies have investigated the existence of abuse typologies. Methods: The study is based on a Danish stratified random probability survey including 2980 interviews of 24-year-old people. The sample was constructed to include an oversampling of child protection cases. Building on a previous latent class analysis of four types of childhood maltreatment, three maltreatment typologies were used in the current analyses. A criminality scale was constructed based on seven types of criminal behavior. PTSD symptoms were assessed by the PC-PTSD Screen. Results: Significant differences were found between the two genders with males reporting heightened rates of criminality. Furthermore, all three maltreatment typologies were associated with criminal behavior with odds ratios (ORs) from 2.90 to 5.32. Female gender had an OR of 0.53 and possible PTSD an OR of 1.84. Conclusion: The independent association of participants at risk for PTSD and three types of maltreatment with criminality should be studied to determine if it can be replicated, and considered in social policy and prevention and rehabilitation interventions.

"168",11101,"Risk factors related to stress psychopathology remain elusive in the etiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychological disturbances. The present study sought to identify specific vulnerabilities related to the onset and maintenance of PTSD. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats (male and female) were randomly assigned to four groups. Three treatment groups were designed to represent various degrees of potential susceptibility to the development of PTSD. Rats assigned to the experimental conditions were given i.p. kainic acid injections to induce hippocampal brain insult and exposed to a two hour restraint stress trauma session. Three shorter stress exposures were introduced at 10 day intervals to simulate situational reminders of trauma. It was hypothesized that rats assigned to the treatment conditions would display substandard performances at test on measures of anxiety and startle reactivity. Inhibitory avoidance and escape were assessed in the elevated T-maze. Measures of habituation and prepulse inhibition were assessed in a startle chamber. The results of the study were inconsistent with the hypotheses. The treatment manipulations failed to reveal differences between the three treatment groups and the control group. Results did reveal significant sex differences. Male rats recorded longer latencies in the elevated T-maze on the measure of inhibitory avoidance. There were no significant differences between males and females on the measure of escape. An analysis of startle reactivity revealed significant Sex x Stress and Sex x Hippocampal Insult interactions. Following stress exposure, male rats were less reactive compared to female rats while male rats exposed to postnatal hippocampal insult were more reactive. Kainic acid and restraint stress manipulations failed to alter habituation. On the analysis of prepulse inhibition male rats failed to inhibit responding to the pre-stimulus warning at the two lower level intensities. The observed sex differences are discussed in the context of differential biological and behavioral mechanisms and protective sex specific advantages. Methodological issues involving the reliability of treatment and testing parameters and developmental, physiological and motivational components beyond the scope of this investigation are addressed as possibly contributing to the lack of differences observed between groups.

This study evaluated the fit of the DSM-5 four-factor model and an alternative four-factor model in 570 injury survivors six years post-injury using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (Blake et al., 1990), updated to include items measuring new DSM-5 symptoms. While both four-factor models fitted the data well, very high correlations between the 'Intrusions' and 'Avoidance' factors in both models and between the 'Negative Alterations in Cognitions and Mood' and 'Arousal and Reactivity' factors in the DSM-5 model and the 'Dysphoria' and 'Hyperarousal' factors in the alternative model were evident, suggesting that a more parsimonious two-factor model combining these pairs of factors may adequately represent the latent structure. Such a two-factor model fitted the data less well according to chi2 difference testing, but demonstrated broadly equivalent fit using other fit indices. Relationships between the factors of each of the four-factor models and the latent factors of Fear and Anxious-Misery/Distress underlying Internalizing disorders (Krueger, 1999) were also explored, with findings providing further support for the close relationship between the Intrusion and Avoidance factors. However, these findings also suggested that there may be some utility to distinguishing Negative Alterations in Cognition and Mood symptoms from Arousal and Reactivity symptoms, and/or Dysphoria symptoms from Hyperarousal symptoms. Further studies are required to assess the potential discriminant validity of the two four-factor models.","an evaluation of the dsm-5 factor structure for posttraumatic stress disorder in survivors of traumatic injury",0,0

"177",7365,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to detect the prevalence of common mental disorders among patients seen by doctors at family health program units in Petropolis-RJ, and to establish their nosological profile. METHOD: The population of the study included all 18 to 65-year-old patient who attended any family health program units included in the study during a 30-day period, between August and December 2002 (n = 714). The prevalence of common mental disorders was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire, 12 item version. In order to establish the nosological profile, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview was administered to all common mental disorders positive patients who accepted to return (n = 215). RESULTS: At the cut-off point of 2/3 the common mental disorders prevalence was 56% and for 4/5, it was 33%. The most frequent nosological categories found among common mental disorders positive patients were depression and anxiety categories along with posttraumatic stress disorder, somatoform pain disorder and dissociative disorders. There was a high frequency of comorbidity, especially between anxiety, depression, somatoform and dissociative disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The common mental disorders prevalence and the nosological profile found in FHP were similar to those of other primary care studies in Brazil, but some disorders (posttraumatic stress disorder, somatoform pain disorder and dissociative disorders) that had not been previously studied in this context were also very frequent. The high common mental disorders prevalence found reinforces the urgent need for systematic inclusion of this level of care in mental health assistance planning.","nosological profile and prevalence of common mental disorders of patients seen at the family health program (fhp) units in petropolis, rio de janeiro",1,0

"179",6445,"BACKGROUND: Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are important women's health issues. Depression is known to be associated with poor physical health; however, associations between physical health and PTSD, a common comorbidity of depression, have received less attention. OBJECTIVES: To examine number of medical symptoms and physical health status in women with PTSD across age strata and benchmark them against those of women with depression alone or with neither depression nor PTSD. METHODS: A random sample of Veterans Health Administration enrollees received a mailed survey in 1999-2000 (response rate, 63%). The 30 865 women respondents were categorized according to whether a health care provider had ever told them that they had PTSD, depression (without PTSD), or neither. Outcomes were self-reported medical conditions and physical health status measured with the Veterans SF-36 instrument, a version of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) modified for use in veteran populations. RESULTS: Across age strata, women with PTSD (n = 4348) had more medical conditions and worse physical health status (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, and energy/vitality scales from the Veterans SF-36) than women with depression alone (n = 7580) or neither (n = 18 937). In age-adjusted analyses, the Physical Component Summary score was on average 3.4 points lower in women with depression alone and 6.3 points lower in women with PTSD than in women with neither (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with a greater burden of medical illness than is seen with depression alone. The presence of PTSD may account for an important component of the excess medical morbidity and functional status limitations seen in women with depression.","burden of medical illness in women with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder",0,0

"181",1240,"Background: A comprehensive meta-analysis to identify the proportions of comorbid personality disorders (PD) across the major subtypes of anxiety disorders (AD) has not previously been published. Methods: A literature search identified 125 empirical papers from the period 1980-2010 on patients with panic disorders, social phobia, generalised anxiety, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several moderators were coded. Results: The rate of any comorbid PD was high across all ADs, ranging from.35 for PTSD to.52 for OCD. Cluster C PDs occurred more than twice as often as cluster A or B PDs. Within cluster C the avoidant PD occurred most frequently, followed by the obsessive-compulsive and the dependent PD. PTSD showed the most heterogeneous clinical picture and social phobia was highly comorbid with avoidant PD. A range of moderators were examined, but most were non-significant or of small effects, except an early age of onset, which in social phobia increased the risk of an avoidant PD considerably. Gender or duration of an AD was not related to variation in PD comorbidity. Limitations: Blind rating of diagnoses was recorded from the papers as an indication of diagnostic validity. However, as too few studies reported it the validity of the comorbid estimates of PD was less strong. Conclusions: The findings provided support to several of the proposed changes in the forthcoming DSM-5.

"183",6260,"Pavlovian threat (fear) conditioning (PTC) is an experimental paradigm that couples innate aversive stimuli with neutral cues to elicit learned defensive behavior in response to the neutral cue. PTC is commonly used as a translational model to study neurobiological and behavioral aspects of fear and anxiety disorders including Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Though PTSD is a complex multi-faceted construct that cannot be fully captured in animals PTC is a conceptually valid model for studying the development and maintenance of learned threat responses. Thus, it can inform the understanding of PTSD symptomatology. However, there are significant individual differences in posttraumatic stress that are not as of yet accounted for in studies of PTC. Individuals exposed to danger have been shown to follow distinct patterns: some adapt rapidly and completely (resilience) others adapt slowly (recovery) and others failure to adapt (chronic stress response). Identifying similar behavioral outcomes in PTC increases the translatability of this model. In this report we present a flexible methodology for identifying individual differences in PTC by modeling latent subpopulations or classes characterized by defensive behavior during training. We provide evidence from a reanalysis of previously examined PTC learning and extinction data in rats to demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology in identifying outcomes analogous to those observed in humans exposed to threat. By utilizing Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) to test for heterogeneity in freezing behavior during threat conditioning and extinction learning in adult male outbred rats (n = 58) three outcomes were identified: rapid extinction (57.3%), slow extinction (32.3%), and failure to extinguish (10.3%) indicating that heterogeneity analogous to that in naturalistic human studies is present in experimental animal studies strengthening their translatability in understanding stress responses in humans.","heterogeneity in threat extinction learning: substantive and methodological considerations for identifying individual difference in response to stress",1,0

RESULTS: Darryl has good internal consistency for the full scale and adequate reliability for each DSM-IV PTSD symptom cluster. Darryl correlates significantly (r = 0.64, P < 0.001) with the most frequently used measure for assessing PTSD in children (CPTSD-RI). As a screening tool, Darryl has excellent sensitivity and specificity in relationship to the KID-SCID. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to other child PTSD measures, Darryl has comparable or better psychometric properties and assesses PTSD symptoms in a more developmentally appropriate manner, especially in the domain of community violence. The value of Darryl as a screening tool remains preliminary given the limited number of diagnosed cases of PTSD in the study sample.

"188",6495,"The current study examined service era differences in a sample of 172 Gulf and Vietnam outpatient veterans with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants completed the MMPI-2 and several additional self-report measures of symptom severity (PTSD, depression, anxiety, hostility, and health complaints). Results indicated that MMPI-2 profiles differed significantly according to service era with Vietnam veterans scoring higher on scales 2, 8, and 0 and lower on scale 9 than did Gulf veterans. Examination of group means derived from parametric analysis of MMPI-2 data suggested a mean two-point code type of 2-8/8-2 for Vietnam veterans and 1-8/8-1 for Gulf veterans. In contrast, when the data were examined using descriptive techniques based on frequency counts of individual MMPI-2 profiles, the most frequently occurring two-point codetype was 7-8/8-7 for Vietnam veterans, and 6-8/8-6 for Gulf veterans. In addition, Gulf veterans reported a greater number of total health complaints than Vietnam veterans, whereas Vietnam veterans reported a greater number of physician-diagnosed physical conditions. Potential advantages of incorporating descriptive approaches versus parametric methods when examining profile data are also presented.","mmpi-2 profiles of gulf and vietnam combat veterans with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder",0,0

Few studies have been carried out in primary care samples and none have taken into consideration the association between PTSD and personality disorder. Aim: To describe prevalence and risk factors of PTSD and its comorbidity with personality disorder. Setting: General practice centre in Valencia (Spain). Method: Patients who had experienced at least one traumatic event in their lives were selected from a random sample attending a primary healthcare centre in Valencia and blindly assessed by trained professionals. Patients suffering from PTSD were compared with those who were not. PTSD and personality disorder diagnoses were established using CIDI and SCID-II interviews respectively. Sex, age at the time of experiencing trauma, frequency, multiplicity and type of trauma, dissociative symptoms, personality disorder and severity of PTSD were subjected to multivariate analysis to estimate the probability of developing PTSD and its duration. Results: Life prevalence rate was 14% and current prevalence 9%. Dissociative symptoms and personality disorder were significantly associated with PTSD. Cluster analysis based on age, frequency and type of trauma revealed the existence of one subgroup composed mainly of women who had experienced frequent body-contact trauma at an early age, developed severe PTSD and suffer from a variety of personality disorders, particularly paranoid personality disorder. Time to the complete disappearance of symptoms was only explained by the initial severity of PTSD.

"193",5406,"Background: Numerous studies have documented an association between mental disorders and onset of cigarette smoking. Yet, there is little understanding of the potential impact of mental disorders on trajectories of smoking over time. The objective of this study was to investigate this relationship among adolescents over a 10-year span. Methods: Data were drawn from the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology Study, a 10-year prospective investigation of youth in Germany. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify smoking trajectories and logistic regression analyses were used to examine relationships between mental disorders and subsequent trajectories. Results: Four trajectories were identified: non-users; increasing use; decreasing use; persistent use. Alcohol/drug use disorders, stress disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorder and nicotine dependence were associated with nicotine use (as compared to the non-smoker class). However, comparisons between trajectories of nicotine use showed that any stress disorder predicted only decreasing use compared to the other two trajectories; nicotine dependence, alcohol/illicit drug use disorders as well as panic disorder and somatoform disorders were inversely associated with increasing use; nicotine dependence and alcohol/drug use disorders were associated with persistent use. Conclusions: Several mental disorders appear to be non-specific markers of the range of smoking trajectories while others predict specific trajectories. Numerous disorders (e.g., alcohol/drug use disorders) do not appear to occur only prior to and predict increased smoking trajectory as had been previously suggested, but rather they also occur concurrently, with high levels of smoking and in some cases smoking persists at a steady level over time.

However, not all individuals who experience either chronic stress or traumatic acute stress develop such disorders. Thus, other factors must confer a vulnerability to stress, and exposure to early-life stress may be one such factor. In this study we examined prenatal stress (PNS) as a potential vulnerability factor that may produce stable changes in central stress response systems and susceptibility to develop fear- and anxiety-like behaviors after adult stress exposure. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were immobilized for 1 h daily during the last week of pregnancy. Controls were unstressed. The male offspring were then studied as adults. As adults, PNS or control rats were first tested for shock-probe defensive burying behavior, then half from each group were exposed to a combined chronic plus acute prolonged stress (CAPS) treatment, consisting of chronic intermittent cold stress (4 degrees C, 6 h/d, 14 days) followed on day 15 by a single session of sequential acute stressors (social defeat, immobilization, cold swim). After CAPS or control treatment, different groups were tested for open field exploration, social interaction, or cued fear conditioning and extinction. Rats were sacrificed at least 5 days after behavioral testing for measurement of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in specific brain regions, and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone. Shock-probe burying, open field exploration and social interaction were unaffected by any treatment. However, PNS elevated basal corticosterone, decreased GR protein levels in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and decreased TH mRNA expression in noradrenergic neurons in the dorsal pons. Further, rats exposed to PNS plus CAPS showed attenuated extinction of cue-conditioned fear. These results suggest that PNS induces vulnerability to subsequent adult stress, resulting in an enhanced fear-like behavioral profile, and dysregulation of brain noradrenergic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) activity.","prenatal stress induces long term stress vulnerability, compromising stress response systems in the brain and impairing extinction of conditioned fear after adult stress",0,0

Method: Lifetime use of psychotropic treatment was explored in a sample of 36,785 persons, participating in the Mental Health Survey in the General Population. Characteristics associated with use of homeopathic treatments, associated or not with conventional psychotropic drugs, were explored using multivariate analyses. Results: Use of homeopathic treatment for psychiatric symptoms was reported by 1.3% of persons. Younger age, female gender and high educational level were associated with use of homeopathy. Half of homeopathy users presented at least one Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) diagnosis, most frequently anxiety disorders. Their diagnostic profile was similar to that of persons reporting use of anxiolytics or hypnotics. Compared to persons with no lifetime use of psychotropic drugs, persons using homeopathy were more likely to present with a diagnosis of mood disorder or anxiety disorder. Compared to those using conventional psychotropic drugs, they presented less frequently with psychiatric disorders, with the exception of anxiety disorders.

"203",3738,"Agomelatine behaves both as a potent agonist at melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors and as a neutral antagonist at 5-HT2C receptors. Accumulating evidence in a broad range of experimental procedures supports the notion that the psychotropic effects of agomelatine are due to the synergy between its melatonergic and 5-hydroxytryptaminergic effects. The recent demonstration of the existence of heteromeric complexes of MT1 and MT2 with 5-HT2C receptors at the cellular level may explain how these two properties of agomelatine translate into a synergistic action that, for example, leads to increases in hippocampal proliferation, maturation and survival through modulation of multiple cellular pathways (increase in trophic factors, synaptic remodelling, glutamate signalling) and key targets (early genes, kinases). The present review focuses on the pharmacological properties of this novel antidepressant. Its mechanism of action, strikingly different from that of conventional classes of antidepressants, opens perspectives towards a better understanding of the physiopathological bases underlying depression.

"205",6174,"Little is known about the role of cognitive social capital among war-affected youth in low- and middle-income countries. We examined the longitudinal association between cognitive social capital and mental health (depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms), functioning, and received social support of children in Burundi. Data were obtained from face-to-face interviews with 176 children over three measurement occasions over the span of 4-months. Cognitive social capital measured the degree to which children believed their community was trustworthy and cohesive. Mental health measures included the Depression Self-Rating Scale (DSRS) (Birleson, 1981), the Child Posttraumatic Symptom Scale (Foa et al., 2001), and a locally constructed scale of functional impairment. Children reported received social support by listing whether they received different types of social support from self-selected key individuals. Cross-lagged path analytic modeling evaluated relationships between cognitive social capital, symptoms and received support separately over baseline (T1), 6-week follow-up (T2), and 4-month follow-up (T3). Each concept was treated and analyzed as a continuous score using manifest indicators. Significant associations between study variables were unidirectional. Cognitive social capital was associated with decreased depression between T1 and T2 (B = -.22, p < .001) and T2 and T3 (beta = -.25, p < .001), and with functional impairment between T1 and T2 (beta = -.15, p = .005) and T2 and T3 (beta = -.14, p = .005); no association was found for PTSD symptoms at either time point. Cognitive social capital was associated with increased social support between T1 and T2 (beta = .16, p = .002) and T2 and T3 (beta = .16, p = .002). In this longitudinal study, cognitive social capital was related to a declining trajectory of children's mental health problems and increases in social support.

"209",2599,"Background: To date, little research has been published on the prominence of the various psychiatric symptoms that result from exposure to a natural disaster. In our study of stress-related symptoms among Norwegian tourists who were repatriated after the 2004 southeast Asian tsunami, we evaluated to what extent symptom scores differed between individuals who were exposed to the disaster and those who were not. Methods: Participants (n = 899) completed a questionnaire via post 6 months after the disaster. The participants were categorized according to their level of exposure to the disaster: danger exposed (caught or chased by the waves), nondanger exposed (other disaster-related stressors) and not exposed. Symptoms were assessed by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), the Post Traumatic Symptom Scale (PTSS-10), and the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R). We used z-transformation of symptom scores (Z-scores) to evaluate the extent to which symptom scores among disaster-exposed individuals differed from those in the nonexposed reference group. Results: The IES-R revealed the greatest differences between nonexposed and disaster-exposed individuals. Hyperarousal was the most prominent symptom cluster that related to disaster exposure, followed by intrusion and then avoidance. Symptoms of anxiety, social dysfunction, withdrawal, somatization and feelings of guilt were more closely linked to exposure than were symptoms of depression. Conclusions: Our results indicate that symptoms of hyperarousal may be more closely linked to acute exposure to a natural disaster such as a tsunami than other symptoms of psychological distress.

Profiles were differentially related to whether IPV victimization was considered traumatic (PTSD criterion A); whether functioning was impaired as a result of PTSD symptoms (PTSD criterion F); whether the woman met full diagnostic criteria for PTSD; depression symptom severity; and severity of psychological, physical, and sexual IPV victimization and use of IPV. An extremely high percentage of women in the high (96%) and moderate (88%) severity classes experienced functional impairment, although many did not meet full diagnostic criteria for PTSD.

"213",6048,"AIM: To evaluate how the type of trauma is related to specific symptom patterns in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. METHODS: A total of 136 PTSD patients exposed to war-related traumatic experiences were divided in four groups: 79 veterans, 18 former prisoners (who witnessed or were subject to torture or frequent assaults), 15 victims of rape, and 24 refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Each group was homogenous in regard to traumatic experiences. RESULTS: Significant inter-group differences were found in symptoms listed in the DSM-IV criteria, and under criteria C (avoidance) and D (arousal). No such differences were observed in symptoms listed under criterion B (intrusive symptoms). The results indicate that stressor characteristics may play a role not only in the variety of symptoms exhibited, but particularly in the number of avoidance and arousal symptoms. Victims of rape tended to present with more avoidance symptoms and fewer hyperarousal symptoms, whereas former prisoners and veterans tended to report more hyperarousal symptoms. Rape victims and former prisoners also reported more symptoms than the other groups. CONCLUSION: There is a strong indication that stressor characteristics influence the variety and number of exhibited intrusive, avoidance, and arousal symptoms.

"215",5904,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with comorbid substance use and posttraumatic stress disorder may differentially benefit from integrated trauma-focused interventions based on specific presenting characteristics such as substance use type and PTSD severity. The current study is a secondary analysis of a NIDA Clinical Trials Network study exploring the effectiveness of two interventions for women with comorbid PTSD and substance use disorders. METHOD: Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association of baseline alcohol misuse with PTSD outcome measures over time for all randomized participants. RESULTS: Women entering treatment with baseline alcohol misuse had higher Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale (PSS-SR) total scores (t=2.43, p<.05), cluster C (avoidance/numbing) scores (t=2.63, p<.01), and cluster D (hyper-arousal) scores (t=2.31, p<.05). For women with alcohol misuse, after treatment week 1, PSS-SR scores were significantly lower in the Seeking Safety intervention during treatment (chi(2)(1)=4.00, p<.05) and follow-up (chi(2)(1)=4.87, p<.05) compared to those in the health education intervention. Alcohol misusers in the Seeking Safety group who had higher baseline hyper-arousal severity improved more quickly than those with lower baseline hyper-arousal severity during treatment (chi(2)(1)=4.06, p<.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the type of substance abuse at treatment entry may inform treatment selection, predict treatment response among those with co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders, and indicate a more severe clinical picture.","the role of alcohol misuse in ptsd outcomes for women in community treatment: a secondary analysis of nida's women and trauma study",0,0

"218",7181,"OBJECTIVE: This study uses data from the largest effectiveness trial to date on treatment of co-occurring posttraumatic stress and substance use disorders, using advances in statistical methodology for modeling treatment attendance and membership turnover in rolling groups. METHOD: Women receiving outpatient substance abuse treatment (N = 353) were randomized to 12 sessions of Seeking Safety or a health education control condition. Assessments were completed at baseline and at 1 week, 3, 6, and 12 months posttreatment. Outcome measures were alcohol and cocaine use in the prior 30 days captured using the Addiction Severity Index. Latent class pattern mixture modeling (LCPMM) was used to estimate attendance patterns and to test for treatment effects within and across latent attendance patterns and group membership turnover. RESULTS: Across LCPMM analyses for alcohol and cocaine use, similar treatment attendance patterns emerged: Completers never decreased below an 80% probability of attendance, droppers never exceeded a 41% probability of attendance, and titrators demonstrated a 50% to 80% probability of attendance. Among completers, there were significant decreases in alcohol use from baseline to 1-week posttreatment, followed by nonsignificant increases in alcohol during follow-up. No differences between treatment conditions were detected. Titrators in Seeking Safety had lower rates of alcohol use from 1-week through 12-month follow-up compared with control participants. Droppers had nonsignificant increases in alcohol during both study phases. Cocaine use findings were similar but did not reach significance levels.

"220",1038,"Objective: To explore the relationship between headache trajectory across the first year after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and the development of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) one year post-injury. Design: Longitudinal cohort. Setting: Community. Participants: 212 prospectively enrolled individuals diagnosed with mTBI. Interventions: None Main Outcome Measure(s): PTSD was measured by the PTSD Checklist- Civilian Version (PCL-C). Headache trajectories were determined by headache pain rating within 7 days of injury and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. Results: Latent Class Trajectory analysis was used to identify 4 trajectories for headache after mTBI: Resolved (early headache that then went away N=28), Worsening (limited early headache with increasing over time N=63), Improving (significant early headache reducing steadily over time N=23), and Chronic (significant headache across time N=100). PTSD was found in 13% of the sample and was significantly associated with having a Chronic headache trajectory with 21 of 25 individuals with PTSD falling in this trajectory. Conclusions: The majority of individuals with mTBI had significant issues with headache over time, with most falling into theWorsening and Chronic trajectories, suggesting that early identification and treatment of headache may be important to change trajectory. In addition, having Chronic headache trajectory across the first year was also significantly associated with PTSD at one year after injury. Additional research is needed to determine how headache pain influences development of PTSD and/or how PTSD contributes to chronicity of headaches.","headache trajectory and the development of post traumatic stress disorder after mild traumatic brain injury",0,0
"221",2568,"The present study aimed at predicting posttraumatic stress 5 and 27 years after the North Sea oil rig disaster. The predictions were based on the initial levels of stress responses and the early recovery as reported in 1980. The Posttraumatic Stress Scale (PTSS) was used at 3 measure points. From 1980, data from 69 survivors were used in latent growth modeling. Follow-up studies included 65 survivors and 85 matched unexposed oil-rig workers in 1985; and 47 and 62 in 2007. In 1985, the survivors had higher total PTSS scores and more frequent endorsements on most single PTSS-items than the comparison group. In 2007, a few single items remained different. The initial levels of stress responses and the early recovery rate predicted the long-term outcomes after 5 and 27 years. Initial screenings may be helpful in the early detection of posttraumatic stress in the very long-term perspective.

"229",5912,"BACKGROUND: Serotonergic antidepressants [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)] are first-line treatments for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD); however, it is not known if synaptic serotonin (5-HT) availability is important for SSRI efficacy. The present study tested the hypothesis that temporary reduction in central 5-HT transmission, through acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), would reverse the therapeutic effect of the SSRIs in GAD patients. METHODS: Twelve patients (six males) with GAD, who showed sustained clinical improvement with SSRI treatment, underwent ATD in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design over 2 days, 1 week apart. At the peak time of depletion, the participants inhaled 7.5% CO2 and air in random order for at least 12 min each. Psychological responses were measured using the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) and GAD-symptom visual analogue scales (VASs; e.g., worry and tense) and Profile of Mood States. RESULTS: Free plasma tryptophan to large neutral amino acid (LNAA) ratio decreased by 92% on the depletion day and decreased by 2% on the control day. Irrespective of depletion condition, 7.5% CO(2) inhalation significantly increased STAI-S and GAD-related VAS scores (all p < 0.05) compared with air inhalation. ATD had no effect on any of these measures despite the substantial reduction in free tryptophan/LNAA ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Although SSRIs treat GAD effectively, the present results suggest that the mechanism of action is different to that seen in panic, social anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorders. Successful SSRI treatment of GAD may involve long-term receptor changes or alterations in other neurotransmitter systems downstream of serotonin.","effects of acute tryptophan depletion in serotonin reuptake inhibitor-remitted patients with generalized anxiety disorder",0,0

Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of the most common war-related mental health conditions, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, and to assess the association between displacement status and these conditions in postwar Jaffna District, Sri Lanka. Design, Setting, and Participants: Between July and September 2009, a cross-sectional multistage cluster sample survey was conducted among 1517 Jaffna District households including 2 internally displaced persons camps. The response rate was 92% (1448 respondents, 1409 eligible respondents). Two percent of participants (n=80) were currently displaced, 29.5% (n=539) were recently resettled, and 68.5% (n=790) were long-term residents. Bivariable analyses followed by multivariable logistic regression models were performed to determine the association between displacement status and mental health. Main Outcome Measures: Symptom criteria of PTSD, anxiety, and depression as measured by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25. Results: The overall prevalences of symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression were 7.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.1%-9.7%), 32.6% (95% CI, 28.5%-36.9%), and 22.2% (95% CI, 18.2%-26.5%), respectively.

This study aimed to identify predictors of 6 months post-disaster stress symptoms and to study 6 months and 24 months course of symptoms among Norwegian tourists who experienced the 2004 tsunami. Methods: Norwegian tourists ((greater-than or equal to)18 years) who experienced the 2004 tsunami (n = 2468) were invited to return a postal questionnaire at two points of time. The first data set was collected at 6 months (T1, n = 899) and the second data set at 24 months post-disaster (T2, n = 1180). The population studied consisted of those who responded at both assessments (n = 674). Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) was used to measure posttraumatic stress symptoms. IES-R score (greater-than or equal to)33 (caseness) was used to identify various symptom trajectories from T1 to T2. Multiple linear regression was used to determine predictors of posttraumatic stress at T1 and to identify variables associated with symptom improvement from T1 to T2. Results: The majority was identified as non-case at both assessments (57.7%), while 20.8% of the respondents were identified as case at both assessments. Symptoms at T1 were positively related to female gender, older age, unemployment, being chased or caught by the waves, witnessing death or suffering, loss of loved ones, experiencing intense fear during the disaster, low conscientiousness, neuroticism and low levels of social support. The IES-R sum score declined from 24.6 (SD = 18.5) at T1 to 22.9 (SD = 18.3) at T2, p < 0.001. Emotional stability and high IES-R scores at T1 were positively related to symptom improvement, while received social support was not. Being referred to a mental health specialist was negatively related to symptom improvement. Conclusions: A significant minority (20-30%) among Norwegian tourists developed enduring posttraumatic stress symptoms in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami. Tsunami exposure, peritraumatic fear, neuroticism and low levels of social support were the strongest predictors of posttraumatic stress at 6 months post-disaster.

"242",11879,"Background: There is considerable interest in understanding further the factors that increase the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for military personnel. This study aimed to investigate the relative contribution of demographic variables; childhood adversity; the nature of exposure to traumatic events during deployment; appraisal of these experiences; and home-coming experiences in relation to the prevalence of PTSD 'caseness' as measured by a score of >50 on the PTSD Checklist (PCL) in UK Armed Forces personnel who have been deployed in Iraq since 2003. Method: Data were drawn from the first stage of a retrospective cohort study comparing UK military personnel who were deployed to the 2003 Iraq War with personnel serving in the UK Armed Forces on 31 March 2003 but who were not deployed to the initial phase of war fighting. Participants were randomly selected and invited to participate. The response rate was 61%. We have limited these analyses to 4762 regular service individuals who responded to the survey and who have been deployed in Iraq since 2003. Results: Post-traumatic stress symptoms were associated with lower rank, being unmarried, having low educational attainment and a history of childhood adversity. Exposure to potentially traumatizing events, in particular being deployed to a 'forward' area in close contact with the enemy, was associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms. Appraisals of the experience as involving threat to one's own life and a perception that work in theatre was above an individual's trade and experience were strongly associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms. Low morale and poor social support within the unit and non-receipt of a home-coming brief (psycho-education) were associated with greater risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms. Conclusions: Personal appraisal of threat to life during the trauma emerged as the most important predictor of post-traumatic stress symptoms. These results also raise the possibility that there are important modifiable occupational factors such as unit morale, leadership, preparing combatants for their role in theatre which may influence an individual's risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms.

"243",12595,"Study objectives: Family presence during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of a loved one remains controversial. Our study aimed to determine if offering a relative the choice to observe CPR of a family member might reduce his psychological impact 90 days later. Methods: A multicenter, cluster randomized, controlled trial. We enrolled 570 relatives of patients who were in cardiac arrest in 17 prehospital emergency medical services. Centers were randomized either to 1) systematically offer the family member the opportunity to observe CPR (intervention group) or 2) to the habitual practice regarding family presence (control group). The primary endpoint was the proportion of relatives having post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms by an Impact of Event Scale (IES)>30 at 90 days. Secondary endpoints were the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms and impact of family presence on medical efforts at resuscitation, wellbeing of the healthcare team, and on the occurrence of medicolegal claims. Analyses used the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Results: 211/266 (79%) relatives witnessed CPR (intervention group) compared to 131/304 (43%) relatives (control group). In the intention-to-treat analysis, family members had PTSD-related symptoms significantly more frequently in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.5; P=0.004) and when they did not witness CPR (adjusted odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5; P=0.02). According to family presence, relatives who did not witness CPR had more frequently symptoms of anxiety and depression. Family-witnessed CPR did not affect resuscitation characteristics, patient survival, medical team stress or result in medicolegal claims. Conclusions: Our results promote family presence during CPR. This experience was associated with positive results on psychological parameters and neither interfered with medical efforts or health care team stress nor resulted in medicolegal conflicts.","family presence during cardiopulmonary resuscitation",0,0

Objectives: To examine the association between various mental disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental disorders) and cholesterol levels, and to discuss the possible treatment implications. Method: A MEDLINE search, citing articles from 1966 onward, supplemented by a review of bibliographies, was conducted to identify relevant studies. Criteria used to identify studies included (1) English language, (2) published studies with original data in peer-reviewed journals. Results: Clinical investigations of cholesterolemia in patients with major mental disorders have produced very conflicting results. Hypercholesterolemia has been reported in patients with schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorders, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD. Low cholesterol level has been reported in patients with major depression, dissociative disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder. It seems that both high and low serum total cholesterol may be associated with a higher risk of the premature death.

"249",13850,"Unexpected extreme sudden traumatic stressor may cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Important traumatic events include war, violent personal assault (e.g., sexual assault, and physical attack), being taken hostage or kidnapped, confinement as a prisoner of war, torture, terrorist attack, severe car accidents, and natural disasters. In childhood age sexual abuse or witnessing serious injuries or unexpected death of a beloved one are among important traumatic events. PTSD can be categorized into two types of acute and chronic PTSD: if symptoms persist for less than three months, it is termed ""acute PTSD,"" other wise, it is called ""chronic PTSD."" 60.7% of men and 51.2% of women would experience at least one potentially traumatic event in their lifetime. The lifetime prevalence of PTSD is significantly higher in women than men. Lifetime prevalence of PTSD varies from 0.3% in China to 6.1% in New Zealand. The prevalence of PTSD in crime victims are between 19% and 75%; rates as high as 80% have been reported following rape. The prevalence of PTSD among direct victims of disasters was reported to be 30%-40%; the rate in rescue workers was 10%-20%. The prevalence of PTSD among police, fire, and emergency service workers ranged from 6%-32%. An overall prevalence rate of 4% for the general population, the rate in rescue/recovery occupations ranged from 5% to 32%, with the highest rate reported in search and rescue personnel (25%), firefighters (21%), and workers with no prior training for facing disaster. War is one of the most intense stressors known to man. Armed forces have a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol abuse and PTSD. High-risk children who have been abused or experienced natural disasters may have an even higher prevalence of PTSD than adults. Female gender, previous psychiatric problem, intensity and nature of exposure to the traumatic event, and lack of social support are known risk factors for work-related PTSD. Working with severely ill patients, journalists and their families, and audiences who witness serious trauma and war at higher risk of PTSD. The intensity of trauma, pre-trauma demographic variables, neuroticism and temperament traits are the best predictors of the severity of PTSD symptoms. About 84% of those suffering from PTSD may have comorbid conditions including alcohol or drug abuse; feeling shame, despair and hopeless; physical symptoms; employment problems; divorce; and violence which make life harder. PTSD may contribute to the development of many other disorders such as anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, substance abuse/dependency disorders, alcohol abuse/dependence, conduct disorder, and mania. It causes serious problems, thus its early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are of paramount importance.","post-traumatic stress disorder",0,0

"252",12033,"Background: Victims of violent assault experience diverse post-event emotional problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and they may have multiple emotional problems. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of PTSD in a longitudinal design. Methods: The levels of physical injury, perceived life threat, prior experience of violence, peritraumatic dissociation (PD), acute PTSD, perceived self-efficacy and perceived social support are considered possible predictors. This study had a single group (N = 70), longitudinal design with three repeated measures over a period of 12 months. Questionnaires used were: Impact of Event Scale-15 and 22 (IES-15 and 22), Post-Traumatic Symptom Scale-10 (PTSS-10), Peritraumatic Dissociation (PD) 7-item self-report measure, Social Provisions Scale (SPS) and Generalized Self-Efficacy scale (GSE). Results: Results showed a high prevalence and severity of PTSD on all outcomes, for instance 31% scored as probable PTSD-cases and 14% as risk level cases by IES-15 at T3. Either injury severity or prior experience of being a victim of violence predicted PTSD in this study. Early PTSD predicted subsequent PTSD, and perceived life threat was a predictor of PD. Furthermore, lack of perceived social support was a predictor of PTSD symptoms at T3. In addition, low perceived self-efficacy was a predictor of PTSD and influenced perceived social support at T1. Conclusions: Our results showed that experience of non-domestic violence may cause serious chronic emotional problems, and therefore it is important to be aware of early symptoms indicating needs for special follow-ups.

However, baclofen's short duration of action and side effects limit its wider use. Here we characterized a novel, GABAB receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM) ADX71943. Experimental Approach: In vitro, ADX71943 was assessed for pharmacological activity and selectivity using recombinant and native GABAB receptors. In vivoADX71943 was assessed in the acetic acid-induced writhing (AAW) test in mice and formalin tests (FTs) in mice and rats. Marble burying (MB) and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests, rotarod, spontaneous locomotor activity (sLMA) and body temperature (BT) tests in mice and rats were used to investigate centrally-mediated effects. Key Results: In vitro, in the presence of GABA, ADX71943 increased the potency and efficacy of agonists and showed selectivity at the GABAB receptor. ADX71943 reduced pain-associated behaviours in AAW; an effect blocked by GABAB receptor antagonist CGP63360. ADX71943 reduced pain in the FT in mice and rats, but was inactive in the MB and EPM despite reaching high concentrations in plasma. ADX71943 had no effect on BT, rotarod and sLMA. Conclusions and Implications: ADX71943 showed consistent and target-related efficacy in tests of disorders that have a significant peripheral component (acute and chronic pain), while having no effect in those associated with centrally-mediated anxiety-like reactivity and side effects. Thus, ADX71943 is a useful pharmacological tool for delineation of peripherally- versus centrally-mediated effects of GABAB receptor activation.","evaluation of peripheral versus central effects of gabab receptor activation using a novel, positive allosteric modulator of the gabab receptor adx71943, a pharmacological tool compound with a fully peripheral activity profile",0,0

Here we characterized a potent and selective mGlu(7) negative allosteric modulator (NAM) (+)-6-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-2-ethyl-6,7-dihydrobenzo[d]oxazol-4(5H)-one (ADX71743). In vitro, Schild plot analysis and reversibility tests at the target confirmed the NAM properties of the compound and attenuation of L-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid-induced synaptic depression confirmed activity at the native receptor. The pharmacokinetic analysis of ADX71743 in mice and rats revealed that it is bioavailable after s.c. administration and is brain penetrant (cerebrospinal fluid concentration/total plasma concentration ratio at C(max) = 5.3%). In vivo, ADX71743 (50, 100, 150 mg/kg, s.c.) caused no impairment of locomotor activity in rats and mice or activity on rotarod in mice. ADX71743 had an anxiolytic-like profile in the marble burying and elevated plus maze tests, dose-dependently reducing the number of buried marbles and increasing open arm exploration, respectively. Whereas ADX71743 caused a small reduction in amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in mice, it was inactive in the mouse 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine-induced head twitch and the rat conditioned avoidance response tests. In addition, the compound was inactive in the mouse forced swim test. These data suggest that ADX71743 is a suitable compound to help unravel the physiologic role of mGlu(7) and to better understand its implication in central nervous system diseases. Our in vivo tests using ADX71743, reported here, suggest that pharmacological inhibition of mGlu(7) is a valid approach for developing novel pharmacotherapies to treat anxiety disorders, but may not be suitable for treatment of depression or psychosis.","adx71743, a potent and selective negative allosteric modulator of metabotropic glutamate receptor 7: in vitro and in vivo characterization",0,0
"265",2021,"Metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGlu7) has been suggested to be a promising novel target for treatment of a range of disorders, including anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, drug abuse, and schizophrenia.

"267",10981,"Objective: To (1) identify long-term trajectories of combat-induced posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms over a 20-year period from 1983 to 2002 in veterans with and without combat stress reaction (CSR) and (2) identify social predictors of these trajectories. Method: A latent growth mixture modeling analysis on PTSD symptoms was conducted to identify PTSD trajectories and predictors. PTSD was defined according to DSM-III and assessed through the PTSD Inventory. Israeli male veterans with (n = 369) and without (n = 306) CSR were queried at 1,2, and 20 years after war about combat exposure, military unit support, family environment, and social reintegration. Results: For both study groups, we identified 4 distinct trajectories with varying prevalence across groups: resilience (CSR = 34.4%, non-CSR = 76.5%), recovery (CSR = 36.3%, non-CSR= 10.5%), delayed onset (CSR = 8.4%, non-CSR = 6.9%), and chronicity (CSR = 20.9%, non-CSR = 6.2%). Predictors of trajectories in both groups included perception of war threat (ORs = 1.59-2.47, P values < .30), and negative social reintegration (ORs = 0.24-0.51, P values < .047). Social support was associated with symptomatology only in the CSR group (ORs = 0.40-0.61, P values < .045), while family coherence was predictive of symptomatology in the non-CSR group (OR = 0.76, P = .015) but not in the CSR group. Conclusions: Findings confirmed heterogeneity of long-term sequelae of combat, revealing 4 trajectories of resilience, recovery, delay, and chronicity in veterans with and without CSR. Symptomatic trajectories were more prevalent for the CSR group, suggesting that acute functional impairment predicts pathological outcomes. Predictors of symptomatic trajectories included perceived threat and social resources at the family, network, and societal levels.

This study examined the executive-functioning and language abilities as well as psychopathological presentation of childhood maltreatment victims in an adolescent psychiatric inpatient setting. The sample consisted of adolescent inpatients (ages 13-19 years old) who completed a neuropsychological/psychological assessment during hospitalization (n = 122). The sample was grouped based on childhood maltreatment history, with one group categorized by maltreatment history (n = 49) and the other group characterized by no maltreatment history (n = 73). Analyses revealed statistically significant differences (p <.01) between maltreatment groups on executive functioning, as well as on measures of self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms. No group differences remained after controlling for posttraumatic stress disorder. Further, distinct neuropsychological profiles were identified for specific types of maltreatment experienced. These findings suggest that while childhood maltreatment is associated with a range of neuropsychological impairments, the specific type of maltreatment experienced may have a significant influence on the type and severity of impairments.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) shows substantial efficacy for prevention of depression relapse, but it has been less studied in anxiety disorders. This study investigated the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of an MBCT group intervention adapted for combat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: Consecutive patients seeking treatment for chronic PTSD at a VA outpatient clinic were enrolled in 8-week MBCT groups, modified for PTSD (four groups, n = 20) or brief treatment-as-usual (TAU) comparison group interventions (three groups, n = 17). Pre and posttherapy psychological assessments with clinician administered PTSD scale (CAPS) were performed with all patients, and self-report measures (PTSD diagnostic scale, PDS, and posttraumatic cognitions inventory, PTCI) were administered in the MBCT group. RESULTS: Intent to treat analyses showed significant improvement in PTSD (CAPS (t(19) = 4.8, P < .001)) in the MBCT condition but not the TAU conditions, and a significant Condition x Time interaction (F[1,35] = 16.4, P < .005). MBCT completers (n = 15, 75%) showed good compliance with assigned homework exercises, and significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PTSD symptom severity on posttreatment assessment in CAPS and PDS (particularly in avoidance/numbing symptoms), and reduced PTSD-relevant cognitions in PTCI (self blame). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest group MBCT as an acceptable brief intervention/adjunctive therapy for combat PTSD, with potential for reducing avoidance symptom cluster and PTSD cognitions.

"277",1626,"Aim: To assess the consequences of psychotrauma in civilian women in Herzegovina who were exposed to prolonged and repetitive traumatic war events and postwar social stressors. Methods: The study included a cluster sample of 367 adult women, divided into two groups. One group (n = 187) comprised women from West Mostar who were exposed to serious traumatic war and post-war events. The other group (n = 180) comprised women from urban areas in Western Herzegovina who were not directly exposed to war destruction and material losses, but experienced war indirectly, through military drafting of their family members and friends. Demographic data on the women were collected by a questionnaire created for the purpose of this study. Data on trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were collected by Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) - Bosnia-Herzegovina version. General psychological symptoms were determined with Symptom Check List-90-revised (SCL-90-R). Data on postwar stressors were collected by a separate questionnaire. Results: In comparison with the control group, women from Western Mostar experienced significantly more traumatic events (mean (plus or minus) standard deviation [SD], 3.3 (plus or minus) 3.2 vs 10.1 (plus or minus) 4.9, respectively, t = 15.91; P<0.001) and had more posttraumatic symptoms (12.3 (plus or minus) 10.3 vs 21.2 (plus or minus) 10.9, respectively, t = 8.42; P<0.001). They also had significantly higher prevalence of PTSD (4.4% vs 28.3%, respectively; (chi)2 = 52.56; P<0.001).

AIMS: This prospective study compares mental health before and after exposure to direct political violence during the People's War in Nepal. METHOD: An adult cohort completed the Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory in 2000 prior to conflict violence in their community and in 2007 after the war. RESULTS: Of the original 316 participants, 298 (94%) participated in the post-conflict assessment. Depression increased from 30.9 to 40.6%. Anxiety increased from 26.2 to 47.7%. Post-conflict post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was 14.1%. Controlling for ageing, the depression increase was not significant. The anxiety increase showed a dose-response association with conflict exposure when controlling for ageing and daily stressors. No demographic group displayed unique vulnerability or resilience to the effects of conflict exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Conflict exposure should be considered in the context of other types of psychiatric risk factors. Conflict exposure predicted increases in anxiety whereas socioeconomic factors and non-conflict stressful life events were the major predictors of depression.

"281",12647,"(from the cover) Approximately 60-80 percent of individuals who survive a traumatic experience will develop post-traumatic stress disorder, impacting an estimated 15 million people in the United States. How does PTSD manifest itself? More critically, how can its effects be mitigated or overcome? Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a comprehensive and thoughtful examination of the nature, causes, and treatment of PTSD. Drawing on the vast experience of its team of authors, the book details the nature and history of PTSD, from the internal and external factors that cause this insidious disorder to the ways it manifests psychologically and socially. The work discusses cutting-edge research related to treatment, intervention, and prevention, and examines the spiritual and psychological strengths that can emerge when one progresses beyond the label of ""disorder"" and becomes a survivor. The book begins with a historical review of the topic. Subsequent chapters offer in-depth exploration of the significant foundations, function, impacts, and treatments associated with PTSD. Each chapter incorporates case studies to bring the information to life and ensure an appreciation of the myriad social, psychological, and biological experiences surrounding PTSD.

We investigated whether in a PTSD sample brain volumes in these areas were related to reporting specific symptoms of PTSD or to overall symptom severity. METHOD: Structural MRI scans were obtained from 28 participants diagnosed with PTSD according to DSM-IV-TR. Participants reported the extent of individual PTSD symptoms using the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale. Voxel-based morphometry applying the Dartel algorithm implemented within SPM5 was used to identify volumetric changes, related to PTSD total, symptom cluster, and individual symptom scores. RESULTS: Brain volume was unrelated to overall PTSD severity, but greater reexperiencing scores predicted reduced volumes in the middle temporal and inferior occipital cortices. Increased reports of flashbacks predicted reduced volume in the insula/parietal operculum and in the inferior temporal gyrus. CONCLUSION: The data illustrate the value of analyses at the symptom level within a patient population to supplement group comparisons of patients and healthy controls. Areas identified were consistent with a neurobiological account of flashbacks implicating specific abnormalities in the ventral visual stream.","association between flashbacks and structural brain abnormalities in posttraumatic stress disorder",0,0

"284",1599,"Posttraumatic stress disorder can develop after individual's exposure or witnessing of life threatening events. It is characterized by three clusters of symptoms. The course of PTSD is often chronic and impedes individual's functioning. Studies of PTSD treatment with paroxetine provide evidence for its efficacy in reducing symptoms and its favorable profile of side-effects. The objective of this work was to determine the efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of PTSD. The sample consisted of 30 subjects with chronic PTSD. All subjects received treatment with paroxetine in therapeutic dose range for six months.

"285",9799,"Posttraumatic stress disorder can develop after individual's exposure or witnessing of life threatening events. It is characterized by three clusters of symptoms. The course of PTSD is often chronic and impedes individual's functioning.

"286",1246,"Background: Since the inception of the diagnosis posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attempts have been undertaken to understand why only a subpopulation of individuals exposed to trauma develops PTSD. Cerebral gray matter reductions have been suggested to be a crucial pathobiological marker of PTSD. However, a quantitative meta-analysis of whole-brain voxel-based morphometry studies is lacking. Methods: Here, we investigated concurrence across voxel-based morphometry studies in PTSD compared with trauma-exposed individuals without PTSD (all together nine studies with 319 subjects) by means of activation likelihood estimation. Results: We identified brain regions of consistent gray matter reduction in anterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, left temporal pole/middle temporal gyrus, and left hippocampus in PTSD patients compared with individuals exposed to trauma without PTSD. Conclusions: This is the first quantitative whole-brain meta-analysis showing brain structure deficits in traumatized subjects with PTSD compared with trauma-exposed healthy control subjects. The gray matter deficit profile overlaps with brain networks of emotion processing, fear extinction, and emotion regulation known to be affected in PTSD. Although the data cannot clarify if this is a predisposition or a consequence of the disease, the results may facilitate the need to control for structural characteristics in future functional brain studies.

"292",6375,"The trajectory of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and PTSD-related symptoms in relation to aging is not well understood. We previously observed higher levels of dissociation as measured by the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) among older Holocaust survivors with, compared to those without, PTSD, though scores on the DES in Holocaust survivors were markedly lower than those that had been reported for younger cohorts. We undertook a longitudinal evaluation of dissociation in Holocaust survivors. Twenty-six Holocaust survivors with current PTSD, 30 Holocaust survivors without current PTSD, and 19 nonexposed were evaluated at the initial evaluation and subsequently 8.11 years later. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the DES scores from these times demonstrated a significant main effect for time and a significant group by time interaction, reflecting a marked decline in Holocaust survivors, particularly those with PTSD. Controlling for age obliterated the effect of time, but not the group by time interaction. A similar pattern was shown with The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores. Different symptoms related to PTSD show different trajectories of change with age, with dissociation appearing to be less prominent with age.","longitudinal assessment of dissociation in holocaust survivors with and without ptsd and nonexposed aged jewish adults",0,0

"299",1522,"BACKGROUND: Pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are frequently co-morbid in the aftermath of a traumatic event. Although several models attempt to explain the relationship between these two disorders, the mechanisms underlying the relationship remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between each PTSD symptom cluster and pain over the course of post-traumatic adjustment. METHOD: In a longitudinal study, injury patients (n=824) were assessed within 1 week post-injury, and then at 3 and 12 months. Pain was measured using a 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to identify causal relationships between pain and PTSD. RESULTS: In a saturated model we found that the relationship between acute pain and 12-month pain was mediated by arousal symptoms at 3 months. We also found that the relationship between baseline arousal and re-experiencing symptoms, and later 12-month arousal and re-experiencing symptoms, was mediated by 3-month pain levels.

Several studies have also provided evidence for an association between dissociative experiences and trauma in patients with various psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality, dissociative identity and eating disorders. Based on the relative paucity of data on dissociation and trauma in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and trichotillomania (TTM), the primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between trauma and dissociative experiences (DE) in these two diagnostic groups. Furthermore, the availability of clinical and genetic data on this sample allowed us to explore clinical and genetic factors relevant to this association. A total of 110 OCD and 32 TTM patients were compared with respect to the degree of dissociation (using the Dissociative Experiences Scale [DES]) and childhood trauma (using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire [CTQ]). Patients were classified on the DES as either ""high"" (mean DES score >/= 30) or ""low"" (mean DES score < 30) dissociators. Additional clinical and genetic factors were also explored with chi-square and t tests as appropriate. A total of 15.8% of OCD patients and 18.8% of TTM patients were high dissociators. OCD and TTM groups were comparable on DES and CTQ total scores, and in both OCD and TTM groups, significant positive correlations were found between mean DES scores and mean CTQ subscores of emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and physical neglect. In the OCD group, high dissociators were significantly younger than low dissociators, and significantly more high dissociators than low dissociators reported a lifetime (current and past) history of tics (P <.001), Tourette's syndrome (P =.019), bulimia nervosa (P =.003), and borderline personality disorder (P =.027).

"307",1726,"Context: More than 2 decades of conflict have led to widespread human suffering and population displacement in Afghanistan. In 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other collaborating partners performed a national population-based mental health survey in Afghanistan. Objective: To provide national estimates of mental health status of the disabled (any restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in the manner considered normal for a human being) and nondisabled Afghan population aged at least 15 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: A national multistage, cluster, population-based mental health survey of 799 adult household members (699 nondisabled and 100 disabled respondents) aged 15 years or older conducted from July to September 2002. Fifty district-level clusters were selected based on probability proportional to size sampling. One village was randomly selected in each cluster and 15 households were randomly selected in each village, yielding 750 households. Main Outcome Measures: Demographics, social functioning as measured by selected questions from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, depressive symptoms measured by the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25, trauma events and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) measured by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, and culture-specific symptoms of mental illness and coping mechanisms. Results: A total of 407 respondents (62.0%) reported experiencing at least 4 trauma events during the previous 10 years. The most common trauma events experienced by the respondents were lack of food and water (56.1%) for nondisabled persons and lack of shelter (69.7%) for disabled persons. The prevalence of respondents with symptoms of depression was 67.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.6%-80.7%) and 71.7% (95% CI, 65.0%-78.4%), and symptoms of anxiety 72.2% (95% CI, 63.8%-80.7%) and 84.6% (95% CI, 74.1%-95.0%) for nondisabled and disabled respondents, respectively. The prevalence of symptoms of PTSD was similar for both groups (nondisabled, 42.1%; 95% CI, 34.2%-50.1%; and disabled, 42.2%; 95% CI, 29.2%-55.2%). Women had significantly poorer mental health status than men did. Respondents who were disabled had significantly lower social functioning and poorer mental health status than those who were nondisabled. Feelings of hatred were high (84% of nondisabled and 81% of disabled respondents). Coping mechanisms included religious and spiritual practices; focusing on basic needs, such as higher income, better housing, and more food; and seeking medical assistance. Conclusions: In this nationally representative survey of Afghans, prevalence rates of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD were high. These data underscore the need for donors and health care planners to address the current lack of mental health care resources, facilities, and trained mental health care professionals in Afghanistan.","mental health, social functioning, and disability in postwar afghanistan",0,0
"308",12698,"(from the chapter) The ""diathesis-stress"" model has been an influential approach for conceptualizing mental disorders. It reconciles the roles of nature and nurture in the etiology of a disorder. ""Diathesis"" refers to a predisposition, tendency, or pre-existing vulnerability to develop a disorder when the individual is exposed to an environmental stressor. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a quintessential example of a diathesis stress phenomenon because it describes a process in which an individual reacts to an environmental stressor by developing a mental disorder (PTSD). This chapter provides some background about PTSD and reviews the evidence for the role of genetic factors as a diathesis for PTSD.

The objective of this study is to examine how heterogeneous posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) trajectories are associated with postdeployment suicidal ideation in veterans 2.5 years postdeployment to a combat zone in Afghanistan. If PTSD trajectories are associated with postdeployment suicidal ideations, then the accumulative knowledge on what characterizes veterans falling into different PTSD trajectories may provide better opportunities for early identification of suicidal high-risk veterans. Method: In this prospective study of 743 Danish soldiers deployed to Afghanistan from February to August in 2009, we collected data at 6 time points from 6 weeks before deployment to 2.5 years after homecoming (total for this study: 456). At all assessments, the soldiers responded to a comprehensive questionnaire including measures of PTSD (measured by the PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version) and other mental and physical health variables, demographics, and social and combat-related factors. Suicidal ideation was measured by an item from the European Parasuicide Study Interview Schedule II. In a previous study based on soldiers from this cohort, we identified 6 PTSD trajectories using latent growth mixture modeling, which we have extracted and applied as independent variables in this study. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied to examine whether deployed soldiers with certain PTSD symptom trajectories were more likely to report suicidal ideation 2.5 years after homecoming. Results:Two PTSD trajectories with high PTSD symptom level 2.5 years after return were significantly associated with suicidal Ideation 2.5 years after homecoming. Thus, a relieved-worsening class, described by initial decreasing PTSD symptom levels followed by a steep increase in symptoms had higher risk of suicidal ideation (OR= 7.84; 95% CI, 1.68-36.6), which was also the case for a late-onset class (OR 5.2; 95% CI, 2.21-12.24) when compared to a low-stable class.

The diagnosis course given by the clinicians was compared with the retrospective subjective estimations by participants. Methods: A total of 93 ex-political prisoners participated in the follow-up study (85 %) with an average age of 64 years. Diagnoses and symptoms were collated using structured clinical interviews and questionnaires. The retrospective subjective estimation of progression of the participants was calculated using a PTSS symptom index based on four symptom groups (intrusions, avoidance, numbing and hyperarousal). Results: At the time of follow-up PTSS was present in 33 % of participants (in 1997 it was 29 %). In 1994 this was present in only approximately 50 % of cases and in the other 50 % it concerned newly incident or remission cases. The next most common diagnoses were major depression episodes (26 %), panic (with or without agoraphobia 24 %) and somatoform disorders (19 %). In the PTSS symptom profile intrusions, flashbacks and alienation feelings decreased with time but in contrast irritability and shock reactions increased. The subjective self-estimation of the course of PTSS symptoms by the participants often gave a resilient (never PTSS) or delayed and rarely a remission course pattern in comparison to the diagnosing clinicians.

"315",1597,"Background: To measure the serum lipid composition of a sample of Brazilian police officers with and without PTSD regularly exposed to potentially traumatic situations. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 118 active duty male police officers. Serum concentrations for total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides were enzymatically determined. Body mass index (BMI) was obtained for each participant. Results: Officers with PTSD exhibited significantly higher serum total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglycerides levels than those without PTSD. Total cholesterol and triglycerides, but not LDL-C, remained associated with PTSD diagnosis after controlling for confounding influences (i.e. socio-demographics, BMI, and tobacco, alcohol and medication use). Limitations: The sample size was small. A nutritional interview was employed instead of established scales to assess alimentary habits, tobacco or alcohol consumption. A self-report screening tool was used to assess the prevalence of PTSD. Conclusions: The association between PTSD and abnormal serum lipid profile and a tendency to exhibit higher BMI suggests that individuals with PTSD may be at increased risk for developing metabolic syndrome, a condition that by itself could account for many of the most serious PTSD-related physical health problems.

"317",6112,"INTRODUCTION: This study identified distinct tobacco use trajectories across 18months in 943 veteran smokers with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in order to describe quit and relapse patterns, examine associations between trajectory groups on baseline characteristics and cessation service utilization, and explore group differences in mental health outcomes. METHODS: Veterans who participated in a multisite, randomized trial of integrated smoking cessation care were grouped using k-means clustering based on reported daily tobacco use between baseline and 18months. Four trajectory clusters were identified: no reduction (62%), temporary reduction (11%), late sustained reduction (9%) and early sustained reduction (18%). RESULTS: Median quit times in the early, late, temporary, and no reduction groups were 451, 141.5, 97, and 2days, respectively. Compared to the early reduction group, the temporary reduction group exhibited higher baseline depression (p<0.01) and anxiety (p<0.01), but did not differ in treatment received, with both groups attending significantly more cessation visits (p<0.001) and more likely to receive recommended pharmacotherapy (p<0.001) than the no reduction group between baseline and 6months. The early reduction group exhibited lower depression relative to the no reduction (p<0.01) and temporary reduction (p<0.01) groups across all assessments between baseline and 18months. Differences were not observed between groups in depressive or PTSD symptom change over time between baseline and 18months.

"319",11897,"(from the chapter) Post-Traumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder that develops in response to a traumatic event or stressor and is characterized by symptoms of reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal. PTSD is rather unique in that it is one of two psychiatric disorders in the fourth edition text revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) that is tied directly to a specified life event. This feature of PTSD has significant implications for the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of the disorder, as well as psychosocial factors, including its development in a medicolegal context.

"320",11743,"Although, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is still a relatively young diagnosis, it has quickly achieved a privileged position within the research literature, which becomes apparent by the enormous number of publications. This article begins with an introduction of the phenomenology of PTSD relating to both classification systems (DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10) and the differences between them. This will be followed by a depiction of epidemiological findings, which show PTSD to be a prevalent disorder with high comorbidity and a chronic course. Subsequently, psychological concepts of aetiology-two of which (Ehlers & Clark, 2000; Foa & Kozak, 1986) will be presented-focus on risk factors, protective factors, and event factors as well as resources and posttraumatic processes, which are increasingly complemented by neurobiological findings. The article concludes with a description of psychotherapeutic interventions, which encompass psychological First Aid and acute interventions as well as those for enduring and chronic conditions. The focus will be on cognitive behavioural methods, which not only show the best efficacy but are also the best evaluated.

For each sample, we analyzed PTSD symptoms and measures of general distress administered at 2 time points. A consistent pattern of findings was observed across assessments for each sample: All 17 PTSD symptoms were highly associated with measures of general distress. Moreover, we found no evidence that dysphoria symptoms were more highly correlated than PTSD-specific symptoms with general distress.

The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (MCMI-III) scores from 50 patients attending for bariatric surgery were cluster analyzed in hopes of identifying clinical subgroups corresponding to typical personality profiles. Results. With regard to personality disorders, the highest prevalence was found in the histrionic disorder, followed by obsessive- compulsive disorder. Cluster analysis revealed three personality profiles, which were validated by examining demographics, morphological variables, scores on anxiety and depression psychometric scales, and MCMI-III clinical scales scores. Groups were different in virtually all the MCMI-III clinical scores, as well as in depression and trait anxiety, with Cluster 3 presenting the worst scores. Conclusions.

Whereas some manifest extreme levels of both functional impairment and PTSD symptomatology, others exhibit markedly less functional impairment despite manifesting clinically significant levels of PTSD. Clinicians can consider this heterogeneity in their treatment decisions.","a cluster analysis of symptom patterns and adjustment in vietnam combat veterans with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder",1,0
"332",7376,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the immediate and sustained psychological health of health care workers who were at high risk of exposure during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. METHODS: At the peak of the 2003 SARS outbreak, we assessed health care workers in 2 acute care Hong Kong general hospitals with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). One year later, we reassessed these health care workers with the PSS-10, the 21-Item Depression and Anxiety Scale (DASS-21), and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R). We recruited high-risk health care workers who practised respiratory medicine and compared them with nonrespiratory medicine workers, who formed the low-risk health care worker control group. RESULTS: In 2003, high-risk health care workers had elevated stress levels (PSS-10 score = 17.0) that were not significantly different from levels in low-risk health care worker control subjects (PSS-10 score = 15.9). More high-risk health care workers reported fatigue, poor sleep, worry about health, and fear of social contact, despite their confidence in infection-control measures. By 2004, however, stress levels in the high-risk group were not only higher (PSS-10 score = 18.6) but also significantly higher than scores among low-risk health care worker control subjects (PSS-10 score = 14.8, P < 0.05). In 2004, the perceived stress levels in the high-risk group were associated with higher depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress scores (P < 0.001). Posttraumatic stress scores were a partial mediator of the relation between the high risk of exposure to SARS and higher perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: Health care workers who were at high risk of contracting SARS appear not only to have chronic stress but also higher levels of depression and anxiety. Front-line staff could benefit from stress management as part of preparation for future outbreaks.","immediate and sustained psychological impact of an emerging infectious disease outbreak on health care workers",0,0

"343",1788,"The current study examined service era differences in a sample of 172 Gulf and Vietnam outpatient veterans with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants completed the MMPI-2 and several additional self-report measures of symptom severity (PTSD, depression, anxiety, hostility, and health complaints). Results indicated that MMPI-2 profiles differed significantly according to service era with Vietnam veterans scoring higher on scales 2, 8, and 0 and lower on scale 9 than did Gulf veterans. Examination of group means derived from parametric analysis of MMPI-2 data suggested a mean two-point code type of 2-8/8-2 for Vietnam veterans and 1-8/8-1 for Gulf veterans. In contrast, when the data were examined using descriptive techniques based on frequency counts of individual MMPI-2 profiles, the most frequently occurring two-point codetype was 7-8/8-7 for Vietnam veterans, and 6-8/8-6 for Gulf veterans. In addition, Gulf veterans reported a greater number of total health complaints than Vietnam veterans, whereas Vietnam veterans reported a greater number of physician-diagnosed physical conditions. Potential advantages of incorporating descriptive approaches versus parametric methods when examining profile data are also presented.

Eleven cytokines and chemokines were measured in supernatants of T-cell mitogen-stimulated whole blood cultures by multiplex immunoassay. Factor analysis was used to identify clusters of cytokines and chemokines. In a regression analysis hostility was related to the cytokine/chemokine clusters, and the potential risk factors age, BMI, smoking, drinking, previous deployment, early life trauma and depression. Explorative factor analysis showed four functional clusters; a pro-inflammatory factor (IL-2, TNFalpha, IFNgamma), an anti-inflammatory factor (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10), IL-6/chemokine factor (IL-6, MCP-1, RANTES, IP-10), and MIF. Hostility was significantly related to decreased IL-6/chemokine secretion and increased pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. There was an inverse relation between age and hostility scores.

"355",11944,"(from the chapter) DSM-IV-TR (APA 2000) defines post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a response to a profoundly distressing event, involving re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing, and symptoms of hyper-arousal. To be deemed traumatic, the event must involve threatened or actual death, or serious injury to the self or others. The response must involve intense fear, helplessness, or horror. The most comprehensive cognitive-behavioural model of PTSD to date suggests that PTSD arises if a person processes a traumatic event and/or its consequences so as to generate a sense of current, serious threat. There are two main subgroups of cognitions that can lead to a persistent sense of threat: appraisal of trauma consequences and appraisals of the traumatic event. While the nature and complexity of appraisals vary widely, almost everyone develops safety behaviours, logically related to their particular concerns. Safety behaviours prevent disconfirmation of unhelpful appraisals, and behavioural experiments are an excellent way to examine their utility. Detailed formulation of maintaining factors and their interactions provides a sound basis for deciding what to tackle first in treatment. The behavioral experiments discussed in this chapter reflect cognitive and behavioural maintaining factors.

"356",11351,"Many alcohol research questions require methods that take a person-centered approach because the interest is in finding heterogeneous groups of individuals, such as those who are susceptible to alcohol dependence and those who are not. A person-centered focus also is useful with longitudinal data to represent heterogeneity in developmental trajectories. In alcohol, drug, and mental health research the recognition of heterogeneity has led to theories of multiple developmental pathways. This paper gives a brief overview of new methods that integrate variable- and person-centered analyses. Methods discussed include latent class analysis, latent transition analysis, latent class growth analysis, growth mixture modeling, and general growth mixture modeling. These methods are presented in a general latent variable modeling framework that expands traditional latent variable modeling by including not only continuous latent variables but also categorical latent variables. The examples presented can be seen as special cases of this general framework. The general framework makes it possible to combine these models and to study new models serving as a stimulus for asking research questions that have both person- and variable-centered aspects.

"360",462,"Literature describing the phenomenology of the stress of combat suggests that war-zone experiences may lead to adverse psychological outcomes such as post-traumatic stress disorder not only because they expose persons to life threat and loss but also because they may contradict deeply held moral and ethical beliefs and expectations. We sought to develop and validate a measure of potentially morally injurious events as a necessary step toward studying moral injury as a possible adverse consequence of combat. We administered an 11-item, self-report Moral Injury Events Scale to active duty Marines 1 week and 3 months following war-zone deployment. Two items were eliminated because of low item-total correlations. The remaining 9 items were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis, which revealed two latent factors that we labeled perceived transgressions and perceived betrayals; these were confirmed via confirmatory factor analysis on an independent sample. The overall Moral Injury Events Scale and its two subscales had favorable internal validity, and comparisons between the 1-week and 3-month data suggested good temporal stability.

ADAA Web site users from October 2002 to January 2003 were invited to complete a survey oriented toward trauma history and psychiatric sequelae. A diagnostic approximation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was based on responses to the Trauma Questionnaire, the Davidson Trauma Scale, and questions about impairment. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale was also used. Variables were tested for their association with PTSD. Among 1558 participants, 87% had a history of trauma, and 38% had current PTSD. The population was comprised predominantly of white middle-class women, half of whom were married. More than 90% were first-time users of the site. Factors associated with PTSD included death of, or harm to, a loved one; personal history of incest, rape, or physical abuse; lower age; lower income; unemployment; missed work; increased medical care; dissatisfaction with psychotropic medication; depressive symptoms; and lower resilience. In this selective convenience sample, there were high rates of traumatization and PTSD. The demographics of this group are similar to those seen in previously studied populations that had contacted the ADAA.

"364",11061,"BACKGROUND: Research on the etiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has rapidly matured, moving from candidate gene studies to interrogation of the entire human genome in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we present the results of a GWAS performed on samples from combat-exposed U.S. Marines and Sailors from the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS) scheduled for deployment to Iraq and/or Afghanistan. The MRS is a large, prospective study with longitudinal follow-up designed to identify risk and resiliency factors for combat-induced stress-related symptoms. Previously implicated PTSD risk loci from the literature and polygenic risk scores across psychiatric disorders were also evaluated in the MRS cohort. METHODS: Participants (N=3494) were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and diagnosed using the DSM-IV diagnostic criterion. Subjects with partial and/or full PTSD diagnosis were called cases, all other subjects were designated controls, and study-wide maximum CAPS scores were used for longitudinal assessments. Genomic DNA was genotyped on the Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome array. Individual genetic ancestry was determined by supervised cluster analysis for subjects of European, African, Hispanic/Native American, and other descent. To test for association of SNPs with PTSD, logistic regressions were performed within each ancestry group and results were combined in meta-analyses. Measures of childhood and adult trauma were included to test for gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions. Polygenic risk scores from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium were used for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). RESULTS: The array produced >800K directly genotyped and >21M imputed markers in 3494 unrelated, trauma-exposed males, of which 940 were diagnosed with partial or full PTSD. The GWAS meta-analysis identified the phosphoribosyl transferase domain containing 1 gene (PRTFDC1) as a genome-wide significant PTSD locus (rs6482463; OR=1.47, SE=0.06, p=2.04x10-9), with a similar effect across ancestry groups. Association of PRTFDC1 with PTSD in an independent military cohort showed some evidence for replication. Loci with suggestive evidence of association (n=25 genes, p<5x10-6) further implicated genes related to immune response and the ubiquitin system, but these findings remain to be replicated in larger GWASs. A replication analysis of 25 putative PTSD genes from the literature found nominally significant SNPs for the majority of these genes, but associations did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparison. A cross-disorder analysis of polygenic risk scores from GWASs of BPD, MDD, and SCZ found that PTSD diagnosis was associated with risk sores of BPD, but not with MDD or SCZ. CONCLUSIONS: This first multi-ethnic/racial GWAS of PTSD highlights the potential to increase power through meta-analyses across ancestry groups. We found evidence for PRTFDC1 as a potential novel PTSD gene, a finding that awaits further replication. Our findings indicate that the genetic architecture of PTSD may be determined by many SNPs with small effects, and overlap with other neuropsychiatric disorders, consistent with current findings from large GWAS of other psychiatric disorders.

"372",1641,"Background: The objective of the study is to describe the community prevalence of psychiatric disorder, mainly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) 3 years after a devastating earthquake. Methods: Three years after the Marmara Earthquake, 683 individuals from the epicentre were randomly selected to form a representative sample and were assessed with Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), Traumatic Stress Symptom Checklist (TSSC) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results: The 36 months prevalence of PTSD and MDD after the Marmara Earthquake were 19.2% and 18.7% respectively. The current prevalence of PTSD and MDD in the affected community was found to be 11.7% and 10.5%, respectively. PTSD and MDD were the most prevalent disorders after the disaster and showed a decrease over time. However, only 38.9% of the PTSD cases identified at any time over the 3 years were in remission at the 3rd-year. The co-occurrence of MDD with PTSD resulted in a decrease in the rate of recovery from PTSD. MDD was also the most prevalent disorder accompanying PTSD. Of all the subjects 37.5% with PTSD still met the MDD criteria at the 3rd year postearthquake. Conclusions: In comparison with the data from pre-earthquake national mental health profile, the present study showed that the prevalence of MDD, panic disorder, OCD, GAD, social phobia and special phobias were still higher in the affected region 3 years after the earthquake.

In addition, an interview was performed at 2 years to 7 years postburn. Data concerning injury characteristics, sociodemographic variables, psychiatric disorders, and HRQoL were obtained. RESULTS: The EQ-5D dimension Mobility improved between hospitalization and 3 months, while Anxiety/Depression improved between 12 months and 2 years to 7 years. Other dimensions improved gradually. At 2 years to 7 years, only the dimensions Pain/Discomfort and Usual activities were lower than in the general population. In addition, overall HRQoL was lower than in the general population when measured by EQ VAS but not by EQ-5D index. EQ-5D index at 2 years to 7 years was predicted by EQ-5D index at 12 months and concurrent work status and pain. EQ VAS at 2 years to 7 years was predicted by previous assessments of work status, posttraumatic stress disorder and EQ VAS, and concurrent work status and substance abuse.

The purpose of this study was to identify distinct clusters of families that include childhood cancer survivors, and to evaluate differences between the clusters with respect to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). METHODS: Childhood cancer survivors and their parents (247 individuals: 88 adolescent cancer survivors, 87 mothers, and 72 fathers) completed self-report questionnaires. Perceptions of family functioning were assessed using the Family Relationship Index and its three dimensions (cohesiveness, expressiveness, and conflict), and individuals were classified into groups via a cluster analytic approach. State-trait anxiety, depression, and PTSS were assessed to all of the participants. RESULTS: The individuals were classified into three types: One cluster featured high cohesiveness, high expressiveness, and low conflict ('Supportive-type', n=102); a second cluster featured low cohesiveness, low expressiveness, and high conflict ('Conflictive-type', n=32); and a third cluster had moderate cohesiveness, moderate expressiveness, and moderate conflict ('Intermediate-type', n=113). Among the three types, an analysis of variance revealed that 'Conflictive-type' members had the highest levels of PTSS, depression, and state-trait anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that perceptions of family functioning are related to psychological distress in family members of childhood cancer survivors. A family-focused intervention might be a useful approach to targeting emotional distress in these families, particularly for families with a 'Conflictive-type' family member.","psychological distress related to patterns of family functioning among japanese childhood cancer survivors and their parents",0,0

Method: Twenty subjects developing (S) and 27 not developing (NS) PTSD after being exposed to either earlier person-under-the- train accident (NA) or being assaulted in the underground environment (A) were included in the study. 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT was performed and the uptake in 29 regions of the brain (VOIs), bilaterally, was assessed. rCBF distribution was compared, using analysis of variance (ANOVA), between groups (S/NS) and type (A/NA) during a situation involving an auditory evoked re-experiencing of the traumatic event. Discriminant analysis was applied to test the concordance between clinical diagnosis and SPECT findings. Results: In the general analyses significant differences were found between groups and types and there was a significant hemisphere null type interaction. S showed higher CBF than NS and so did A as compared to NA, particularly in the right hemisphere. Discriminant analysis correctly classified 66% of cases (p < 0001) in testing S/NS and 72% (p < 0001) in testing NA/A. Conclusions: Under recall of their traumatic experience we found higher relative CBF distribution values in S as compared to NS. CBF was higher in the right hemisphere and particularly in assaulted subjects. These findings underscore the role upon trauma recall of both the right hemisphere and the nature of the stressing event.","regional cerebral blood flow during auditory recall in 47 subjects exposed to assaultive and non-ssaultive trauma and developing or not posttraumatic stress disorder",0,0

"382",7303,"Factor-analytic studies of the structure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms have yielded inconsistent results. One of the reasons for the inconsistency may be that PTSD is highly comorbid with other disorders; the observed factor structure might depend on the particular comorbid disorder. One such disorder is chronic pain. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether PTSD symptom structure differs between pain and pain-free patients scheduled to undergo major surgery. Four hundred and forty-seven patients who were approached 7 to 10 days prior to scheduled surgery completed the PTSD Checklist-Civilian (PCL-C) Version and the Current Pain and Pain History Questionnaire; the latter was used to divide patients into pain (N = 175) and pain-free (N = 272) groups. Results showed that in pain-free patients, PTSD symptoms were best expressed as 2 symptom clusters (re-experiencing/avoidance; emotional numbing/hyperarousal) accounting for 52.4% of the variance. In pain patients, PTSD symptoms were best expressed as a single symptom cluster accounting for 51.1% of the variance. These results suggest different interrelationships among PTSD symptoms in these 2 populations. Results reflect the need for (1) controlling for pain in studies looking at PTSD-symptom expression and (2) further research on PTSD-symptom expression in pain populations. PERSPECTIVE: These results may have important implications for research on the comorbidity between PTSD and chronic pain, as well as for treatment of PTSD symptoms in patients presenting with pain problems.","structure of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in pain and pain-free patients scheduled for major surgery",0,0

"387",11719,"Examines the recent clinical and research literature regarding risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in childhood and the various manifestations in which PTSD may present in childhood and adolescence. Case vignettes are presented to elucidate issues that often emerge in the diagnosis and treatment of PTSD in childhood and adolescence. The past decade has seen a significant increase in the understanding of the effects of trauma on children. Recent studies have elucidated which children are most at risk for developing PTSD, what types of stressors are most likely to result in chronic post-traumatic reactions, and the differential impact of trauma on the child at different stages of development. There is far less research regarding which psychotherapeutic interventions are most beneficial for child survivors of disaster or interpersonal victimization, and there are virtually no studies of the effectiveness of psychopharmacologic treatments. Studies of adults with PTSD, however, suggest that cognitive-behavioral treatments, possibly supplemented with medication, show much promise.

Psychotherapy has shown that neither the psychopathological signs of trauma nor the expression of traumatic memories are static over time. However, few studies have investigated the neural substrates of psychotherapy-related symptom changes. METHOD: We studied 16 subthreshold post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) subjects by using a script-driven symptom provocation paradigm adapted for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) that was read aloud during traumatic memory retrieval both before and after exposure-based and cognitive restructuring therapy. Their neural activity levels were compared with a control group comprising 11 waiting-list subthreshold PTSD patients, who were age- and profile-matched with the psychotherapy group. RESULTS: Significantly higher activity was observed in the parietal lobes, left hippocampus, thalamus and left prefrontal cortex during memory retrieval after psychotherapy. Positive correlations were found between activity changes in the left prefrontal cortex and left thalamus, and also between the left prefrontal cortex and left parietal lobe. CONCLUSIONS: Neural mechanisms involved in subthreshold PTSD may share neural similarities with those underlying the fragmented and non-verbal nature of traumatic memories in full PTSD. Moreover, psychotherapy may influence the development of a narrative pattern overlaying the declarative memory neural substrates.","cerebral blood flow changes during retrieval of traumatic memories before and after psychotherapy: a spect study",0,0

METHODS: This study is based on diagnostic assessments administered at intake and subsequent follow-up interviews over a period of 15 years in a sample of 90 anxiety-disordered patients with comorbid PTSD who participated in the Harvard Brown Anxiety Research project (HARP). Kaplan-Meier life table analysis revealed a 0.20 probability of full remission during the 15 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Latent growth model (LGM) analysis revealed that the number of trauma exposures was a predictor of a worse course of PTSD but only during some intervals of the 15-year follow-up. Subjects with full social phobia were more likely to experience worsening of PTSD over time in comparison with subjects with less severe social phobia. Role functioning in the areas of household and employment was a significant predictor of a declining course of PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed the dynamic nature of the predictive value of traumatic experiences, the deleterious effect of social phobia and the long term effect of psychosocial functioning on the course of PTSD.

"393",1607,"We have carried out this research because accidents are a serious public health problem in Mexico. They are the third overall mortality cause and the first among young adults. In addition, in our country, the study of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has not been focused sufficiendy on accidents, not to speak of motor vehicles accidents. Among the different types of accidents, traffic accidents are placed at the top of the list. Aside from causing injuries and the loss of man hours at work, these accidents bring about emotional distress to affected individuals. Stress is a factor that triggers short-and medium-term consequences which are in turn reflected in the quality of life of the patient and his/her family. PTSD is an anxiety disorder that causes psychosocial dis functioning and appears due to the exposure to a stressor or traumatic event. It may come about in two ways: when the subject is a victim of a serious threat to his/her life or integrity and when the subject witnesses an event seriously affecting a third party. The main stressors may be natural phenomena, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, intentional attacks, such as rape or any form of criminal violence, and, as is the case here, from traumatic events caused by motor vehicles. The etiology of PTSD is multi-factorial and involves genetic, psychological, educational, and environmental aspects. It has three forms: severe, where the disorder appears immediately after the occurrence of the event or until a month later; chronic, lasting between one and three months; and delayed, where symptoms appear six months after the event. Our objective was to establish PTSD frequency in patients with physical injuries caused by motor vehicles accidents who were attended at the Regional Orthopaedics and Trauma Hospital ""Adolfo Lopez Mateos"". Together with the application of the scales, we were interested in making a description of the socio-demographical side of accidents, comparing the affect profile, and somehow defining the wide range of factors involved in the occurrence of this problem. For this, we devised a transversal and descriptive study with a non-probabilistic sampling. The sample was chosen using the following inclusion criteria: a)Being older than 18 years. b)Having suffered a motor vehicle accident. c)Having received attention for a month at least at the Orthopaedics and Trauma Hospital ""Adolfo Lopez Mateos"". d)Having the physical and mental conditions to answer a self-report questionnaire or at least to be interviewed instead. The instrument used was a self-report questionnaire consisting of different scales: 1. The Mississippi PTSD Scale for screening, case selection and symptoms severity measurement. This scale has been translated and validated in Mexico. 2. The WHO Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN). 3. An instrument to establish the affect profile (PANAS). 4. A socio-demographical data identification schedule. Results from this study show some interesting characteristics from subjects involved in traffic accidents such as the fact that victims are mostly men driving alone at weekends. As has been pointed out, this supports the importance of putting into practice actions to educate drivers involved in such circumstances more often. In addition, policies which allow for the modification of traffic environments as to their adequateness to social contexts should be established. Likewise, data from this work agree with those from other studies as to the existence of an association between the presence of PTSD and the involvement in car accidents. Although the prevalence of the sample of this study is much higher than previous Mexican reports, it shows some interesting figures regarding the fact that most subjects who reported PTSD were women who had an elementary education level and a partner by the time of the accident. Falls from vehicles, people run over by cars and individuals driving alone at the time of accidents were other relevant high-impact findings. While it is true, on the one hand, that the aforementioned resu ts are non-significant, they do give an idea of some aspects which would be useful to bear in mind in providing clinical attention to affected individuals. On the other hand, aspects which did have a statistical significance on the data from this sample should be taken into account. One of these was the fact that the higher rate of PTSD was reported in individuals who suffered an accident while being inside a vehicle, in individuals involved in an accident which had occurred between one and three months before and who in addition tended to present a negative affect profile. These are important findings because they give us the opportunity to consider more specific aspects at the time of developing attention strategies which could alleviate the temporal impact and scale of the problem.","post-traumatic stress disorder in patients with non intentional injuries caused by road traffic accidents",0,0

We also assessed the ability of an antagonist of the corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptors to reverse the effects of stress. Male adult mice were exposed to repeated defeat experiences for 21 days using a sensorial contact model. After 18 days of defeat, two groups of subjects were established (active and passive), according to their behaviors during social confrontation. Antalarmin treatment was given for 4 and 6 days. The results corroborated previous data indicating that subjects who adopted a passive coping strategy had higher corticosterone levels after 21 days of defeat and decreased resting levels 3 days later. Moreover, they showed higher resting expression levels of hypothalamic CRH than their active counterparts. On day 24, the experimental animals were subjected to another social defeat to determine whether the stress response remained. The increase in corticosterone and hypothalamic CRH levels was similar for all of the stressed subjects, but the passive subjects also had a greater CRH response in the amygdala. Passive subjects had decreased levels of adrenal dopamine (beta)-hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase and plasma adrenaline compared to the active subjects, and lower plasma noradrenaline levels than manipulated controls. The passive profile of physiological changes in both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axes has been associated with changes related to mood disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder and depression.

"397",5890,"INTRODUCTION: Severe traumatic brain injury (STBI) can cause psychological stress in proxies in the long-term. This study assessed post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms in proxies of survivors of STBI in the short-term and investigated stress-associated factors. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study, conducted at three Swiss trauma centres over 1 year. Patient and proxy demographics, trauma data including Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and management data were collected. The proxies' PTS symptoms were assessed by applying the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), once in the first month after the accident (median: 11 days). RESULTS: Sixty-nine proxies were included; 52 proxies were female (77.8%). Mean IES-R sum score for intrusions was 13.38 (SD=7.26), for avoidance 8.91 (SD=5.94), and for hyperarousal 9.07 (SD=6.75). Clinically significant PTS symptoms were observed in 36 proxies (52.2%); mean IES-R sum scores were significantly higher in women. IES-R sub-scale values were inversely related with GCS at the scene of the accident and on hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of proxies had clinically significant PTS symptoms shortly after their relative's accident. More severe PTS symptoms were found in women and in proxies of patients with poorer initial GCS scores. Further research into risk groups in the short- and long-term and the long-term impact on patients of PTS syndrome in proxies is warranted.","post-traumatic stress symptoms in relatives in the first weeks after severe traumatic brain injury",1,0

"401",2211,"Background: Health-related Quality of Life (QoL) has gained increased attention in medicine but a specific QoL instrument for trauma patients does not yet exist. Following the recommendations of a recent international consensus conference, the Polytrauma Outcome (POLO) Chart, a modular (generic plus disease-specific) instrument was developed for systematic outcome assessment of multiply injured patients as part of the German Trauma Registry. The development of the disease-specific module, the Trauma Outcome Profile (TOP), is described. Methods: Phase I - item collection, including a pilot study; phase II - item reduction; phase III - pre-testing in 70 polytraumatized patients and 70 controls with minor injuries. The instrument covers the four domains of QoL: physical, psychological, social, and functional capacity. Factor analysis and inter-item correlation was used to investigate relationships between items. Results: The initial phase generated 175 questions. In phase II the number of items was reduced to 64 by statistical analysis and clinical experts. Pre-testing with factor analysis generated a final instrument with eight dimensions: depression, anxiousness, post-traumatic stress disorder, social interactions, daily activities, mental functioning, pain and physical functioning. Two questions on body image and satisfaction were added. The TOP is currently being validated (phase IV). Conclusions: Together with the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), the EuroQoL, and the SF-36, the TOP module is part of the POLO-Chart. It is the first disease-specific instrument for QoL assessment in patients with multiple injuries. The extended development process has enabled all relevant aspects of a patient's status after trauma to be considered. This instrument will be used by the German Trauma Registry for systematic follow-up investigations. The TOP can also be used as a standardized stand-alone screening measurement in follow-up investigations for individual trauma patients.

Person-oriented analyses were applied to questionnaire data from a sample of 509 Italian municipal police officers. Two groups with different patterns of risk and protective factors were found by cluster analysis. One group (resilient officers) had higher levels of protective factors such as self-esteem and social support and lower levels of risk factors such as peritraumatic distress and perceived threat in comparison to the other group (non resilient police officers). The resilient group reported fewer traumatic stress reactions than the non resilient group in spite of a similar degree of exposure to critical incidents and better health than expected in spite of severe abuse. The two groups differed according to sleeping pills use but not for alcohol and smoking habits. Risk and protective factors could offer an explanation of resilience as an outcome.

Extant research has not explored comorbidity clusters in this population more broadly, particularly co-occurring chronic diseases. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to identify comorbidity clusters among diagnoses of deployment-specific (TBI, PTSD, pain) and chronic (eg, hypertension, diabetes) conditions, and to examine the association of these clusters with health care utilization and adverse outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study. SUBJECTS: The cohort comprised OEF/OIF Veterans who received care in the Veterans Health Administration in fiscal years (FY) 2008-2010. MEASURES: We identified comorbidity using validated ICD-9-CM code-based algorithms and FY08-09 data, followed by which we applied latent class analysis to identify the most statistically distinct and clinically meaningful patterns of comorbidity. We examined the association of these clusters with process measures/outcomes using logistic regression to correlate medication use, acute health care utilization, and adverse outcomes in FY10. RESULTS: In this cohort (N=191,797), we found 6 comorbidity clusters. Cluster 1: PCT+Chronic Disease (5%); Cluster 2: PCT (9%); Cluster 3: Mental Health+Substance Abuse (24%); Cluster 4: Sleep, Amputation, Chronic Disease (4%); Cluster 5: Pain, Moderate PTSD (6%); and Cluster 6: Relatively Healthy (53%). Subsequent health care utilization patterns and adverse events were consistent with disease patterns.

Peritraumatic dissociation was assessed only at baseline. Regression analyses that took regression to the mean and cluster sampling into account were applied. The results on intervention effectiveness were specific to gender and peritraumatic dissociation. At T2, the intervention significantly reduced the proportion of clinical PTSS among boys, and both the symptom level (R(2) = .24), and proportion of clinical PTSS among girls who had a low level of peritraumatic dissociation.

"416",12852,"Background: The nosological validity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains controversial in non-Western communities. After natural disasters, epidemiological studies often overlook these conceptual debates and assess posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) by short screening instruments. Such PTSS estimates are reported as inflated prevalence rates of PTSD in post-disaster settings. Aims: To discuss the prevalence and determinants of PTSS within the context of pertinent epidemiological and nosological debates. Methods: We assessed PTSS and grief symptoms of 643 survivors from five Indian villages struck by the Asian tsunami using the Impact of Events Scale - Revised and Complicated Grief Assessment Scale. We adopted a case control design and employed complex sample multiple logistic regression statistics to study the determinants of PTSS. Results: The prevalence of PTSS was 15.1% (95% CI 12.3%-17.9%). PTSS was significantly associated with traumatic grief, female gender, physical injury, death of children and financial losses, but not with functional disability (p = .91). Conclusions: Although PTSS were common in this population, elevating them to a psychiatric construct of PTSD is questionable, when functional impairment and avoidance behaviours were absent. Grief reactions, socio-economic burden, and poor support systems contribute towards PTSS. We highlight the important issues regarding the nosological validity and epidemiology of PTSD in non-Western communities.

Ninety-three females with the FMR1 premutation were in the study and were compared to 2,159 women from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) dataset. Mood and anxiety disorders were assessed using the SCID-I. Our data reflect elevated lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD), lifetime panic disorder without agoraphobia and current agoraphobia without panic disorder in the FMR1 premutation sample. Also, we found a low frequency of lifetime social phobia, specific phobia, and post-traumatic stress disorders and current specific phobia in the FMR1 premutation sample. The profile of MDD in the FMR1 premutation sample was not episodic or comorbid with an anxiety disorder, as in the NCS-R dataset. Never having been married and smaller CGG repeat length were associated with increased likelihood of MDD while increased children with FXS in the family and greater child problem behaviors were associated with increased likelihood of an anxiety disorder in the FMR 1 premutation group. Major depression in females with the FMR1 premutation may not be characterized as an episodically chronic recurrent disorder as it is in community samples and may have a genetic basis given the relationship with CGG repeat length and lack of association with all child and most demographic factors.","mood and anxiety disorders in females with the fmr1 premutation",0,0

Never having been married and smaller CGG repeat length were associated with increased likelihood of MDD while increased children with FXS in the family and greater child problem behaviors were associated with increased likelihood of an anxiety disorder in the FMR 1 premutation group. Major depression in females with the FMR1 premutation may not be characterized as an episodically chronic recurrent disorder as it is in community samples and may have a genetic basis given the relationship with CGG repeat length and lack of association with all child and most demographic factors.

"425",6186,"Emotional Processing Theory proposes that habituation to trauma-related stimuli is an essential component of PTSD treatment. However, the mechanisms underlying treatment-related habituation are not well understood. We examined one psychophysiological measure that holds potential for elucidating the biological processes involved in treatment response: trauma-potentiated startle response. Seventeen OEF/OIF combat Veterans participated in the study and completed three assessments using a trauma-potentiated startle paradigm over PTSD treatment. Results revealed different patterns of trauma-potentiated startle across treatment for responders and nonresponders, but no differences in within task habituation. Responders showed an increase followed by a decrease in trauma-potentiated startle, whereas nonresponders showed a relatively flat response profile. Results suggested that PTSD patients who engage with emotional content as demonstrated by greater startle reactivity may be more likely to respond to PTSD treatment. Furthermore, trauma-potentiated startle shows promise as an objective measure of psychophysiological responses involved in PTSD recovery.","changes in trauma-potentiated startle with treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder in combat veterans",0,0

"427",3684,"Background and purpose: Recent evidence suggests that there may be more than one Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS)/tic disorder phenotype. However, little is known about the common patterns of these GTS/tic disorder-related comorbidities. In addition, sex-specific phenomenological data of GTS/tic disorder-affected adults are rare. Therefore, this community-based study used latent class analyses (LCA) to investigate sex-related and non-sex-related subtypes of GTS/tic disorders and their most common comorbidities. Methods: The data were drawn from the PsyCoLaus study (n=3691), a population-based survey conducted in Lausanne, Switzerland. LCA were performed on the data of 80 subjects manifesting motor/vocal tics during their childhood/adolescence. Comorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, depressive, phobia and panic symptoms/syndromes comprised the selected indicators. The resultant classes were characterized by psychosocial correlates. Results: In LCA, four latent classes provided the best fit to the data. We identified two male-related classes. The first class exhibited both ADHD and depression. The second class comprised males with only depression. Class three was a female-related class depicting obsessive thoughts/compulsive acts, phobias and panic attacks. This class manifested high psychosocial impairment. Class four had a balanced sex proportion and comorbid symptoms/syndromes such as phobias and panic attacks. The complementary occurrence of comorbid obsessive thoughts/compulsive acts and ADHD impulsivity was remarkable. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying LCA to community data of GTS symptoms/tic disorder-affected persons. Our findings support the utility of differentiating GTS/tic disorder subphenotypes on the basis of comorbid syndromes.

"431",1256,"Many typical symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) occur within interpersonal contexts, suggesting that BPD is characterized by aberrant social cognition. While research consistently shows that BPD patients have biases in mental state attribution (e.g., evaluate others as malevolent), the research focusing on accuracy in inferring mental states (i.e., cognitive empathy) is less consistent. For complex and ecologically valid tasks in particular, emerging evidence suggests that individuals with BPD have impairments in the attribution of emotions, thoughts, and intentions of others (e.g., Preissler et al., 2010). A history of childhood trauma and co-morbid PTSD seem to be strong additional predictors for cognitive empathy deficits. Together with reduced emotional empathy and aberrant sending of social signals (e.g., expression of mixed and hard-to-read emotions), the deficits in mental state attribution might contribute to behavioral problems in BPD. Given the importance of social cognition on the part of both the sender and the recipient in maintaining interpersonal relationships and therapeutic alliance, these impairments deserve more attention.

"433",6536,"PURPOSE: This study tests the hypothesis that trauma histories, including histories of physical and sexual abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more prevalent in psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (NES) patients than in epilepsy patients. METHODS: Thirty-five inpatients with intractable seizures were evaluated for trauma history and PTSD. After these assessments, patients were diagnosed as having either epileptic or nonepileptic seizures through EEG monitoring. RESULTS: NES diagnosis correlated with PTSD and total number of lifetime traumas, adult traumas, and abuse traumas. Contrary to previous hypotheses, reported childhood sexual abuse (CSA) did not correlate significantly with NES diagnosis. However, CSA predicted PTSD in a discriminant analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence for the hypothesized relations between trauma, abuse, PTSD, and NES diagnosis. However, elevated levels in both seizure-disorder groups suggest that routine assessment for abuse, trauma, and PTSD might facilitate medical care and treatment for all intractable seizure patients.","a comparative study of trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder prevalence in epilepsy patients and psychogenic nonepileptic seizure patients",0,0

"435",1909,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), previously defined in Vietnam War veterans, was described in 251 Desert Storm reservists. The Mississippi Scale, Revised, was used with a brief demographic profile to survey Army, Marine, and Air Force personnel who had been deployed to Saudi Arabia. Age, sex, marital status, race, rank, duty, length of deployment, and branch of service were not found to be significantly related to PTSD symptoms. However, those surveyed within 3 to 6 months of homecoming reported significantly greater symptoms than those surveyed after 6 months. Five percent of subjects were found to have clinically diagnostic levels of PTSD symptoms 6 months after homecoming. Individuals who expressed difficulty discussing their experiences with more than one person also showed significantly higher PTSD scores. These findings indicate that readjustment reactions were prevalent during the first 6 months and that PTSD could be identified in 5% of the Desert Storm veterans.","an exploration of the characteristics of post-traumatic stress disorder in reserve forces deployed during desert storm",0,0
"436",7325,"OBJECTIVE: To examine effects of gender and trauma type on response to treatment with venlafaxine extended release (ER) or placebo in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHOD: Data were pooled from 2 flexible-dose, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials: a 12-week trial conducted in the United States (March 2001 to December 2002) and a 24-week trial conducted in 12 countries outside the United States (October 2001 to December 2003). Six hundred eighty-seven outpatients with DSM-IV-diagnosed PTSD and a 17-item Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale abbreviated 1-week Symptom Status version (CAPS-SX-17) score > or = 60 were randomly assigned to treatment with venlafaxine ER (37.5 mg/day-300 mg/day, N = 340) or placebo (N = 347). The primary efficacy end point was the CAPS-SX-17 total score at week 12. Secondary end points included CAPS-SX-17 cluster scores for reexperiencing, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal and scores on the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale, Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17). Analysis-of-covariance models were used to test for differences by gender and trauma type (accidental injury, combat, nonsexual abuse, adult sexual abuse, childhood sexual abuse, unexpected death, and other), treatment (venlafaxine ER vs. placebo), and the treatment-by-trauma-type interaction. RESULTS: Using last-observation-carried-forward analysis, significant effects of treatment with venlafaxine ER were found on the CAPS-SX-17 total score and on all CAPS-SX-17 cluster scores and most other secondary measures. No significant treatment-by-gender interactions were observed. Trauma type significantly affected treatment responsiveness on symptom-related disability (SDS, p = .0057) and resilience (CD-RISC, p = .0012), with a nearly significant effect on depression (HAM-D-17, p = .0625). CONCLUSION: Overall, there does not appear to be a significant effect of gender on the efficacy of venlafaxine ER in the treatment of PTSD. Trauma type may affect treatment outcome but seems to affect domains such as disability and resilience more than core PTSD symptoms.","a pooled analysis of gender and trauma-type effects on responsiveness to treatment of ptsd with venlafaxine extended release or placebo",0,0

The nature of relations in these multidirectionally interacting allostatic systems is difficult to evaluate in humans. To assess the complex responses to war-related chronic stress we used multivariate statistical model analysis. Materials and methods: Twenty-nine detainees released from the concentration camp and 15 controls were included in the study. Psychological status was assessed by COR-NEX2 and Hamilton tests, nutritional status by serum albumin and total protein levels, and endocrine status by serum cortisol, (beta)-endorphin, prolactin, T3 and T4 levels. Immune status was estimated by flow cytometric enumeration of the lymphocyte subpopulations, NK and phagocytic activities and serum cytokines (IL-2, TNF, IFN) levels. To assess the relations between psychological, nutritional, endocrine and immune statuses representet by sets of several variables each, multivariate canonical correlation and cluster analysis were aplyed. Results: Although no causal relationship can be inferred from this study, multiple interactions were established between the statuses examined. Psychological and nutritional variables correlated with T lymphocyte activation and non-specific immune functions while hormonal and psychological statuses, being in correlation, contributed to the relation with immunofunctional variables. By cluster analysis, all variables employed were structured into four clusters, reflecting more or less the same relation among the psychological, endocrine, immune and nutritional statuses. Conclusion: The multivariate model analyses employed confirmed the prevailing influence of chronic stress on hormonal and immunological responses, although in order to arrive at a more reliable interpretation of such complex interactions, some other important variables and larger sample size should be employed.","interactions of immunological, psychological, hormonal, and nutritional alterations in war-related chronic stress",0,0

"441",506,"Objective: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to explore the longitudinal course of PTSD in DSM-5-defined trauma exposed populations to identify the course of illness and recovery for individuals and populations experiencing PTSD. Methods: We reviewed the published literature from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2010 for longitudinal studies of directly exposed trauma populations in order to: (1) review rates of PTSD in the first year after a traumatic event; (2) examine potential types of proposed DSM-5 direct trauma exposure (intentional and non-intentional); and (3) identify the clinical course of PTSD (early onset, later onset, chronicity, remission, and resilience). Of the 2537 identified articles, 58 articles representing 35 unique subject populations met the proposed DSM-5 criteria for experiencing a traumatic event, and assessed PTSD at two or more time points within 12 months of the traumatic event. Results: The mean prevalence of PTSD across all studies decreases from 28.8% (range = 3.1-87.5%) at 1 month to 17.0% (range = 0.6-43.8%) at 12 months. However, when traumatic events are classified into intentional and non-intentional, the median prevalences trend down for the non-intentional trauma exposed populations, while the median prevalences in the intentional trauma category steadily increase from 11.8% to 23.3%. Across five studies with sufficient data, 37.1% of those exposed to intentional trauma develop PTSD. Among those with PTSD, about one third (34.8%) remit after 3 months. Nearly 40% of those with PTSD (39.1%) have a chronic course, and only a very small fraction (3.5%) of new PTSD cases appears after three months. Conclusions: Understanding the trajectories of PTSD over time, and how it may vary by type of traumatic event (intentional vs. non-intentional) will assist public health planning and treatment.","a systematic review of ptsd prevalence and trajectories in dsm-5 defined trauma exposed populations: intentional and non-intentional traumatic events",0,0

The study was conducted on a representative female sample recruited from a town in central eastern Turkey. The Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule, the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and borderline personality disorder sections of the Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV Axis-I and Personality Disorders, and the Childhood Abuse and Neglect Questionnaire were administered to 628 women. Of these, 127 (20.2%) women reported at least 1 type of PNP and 13 (2.1%) women reported possession. Women with a dissociative disorder reported all types of possession and PNP (except telepathy) more frequently than those without. Whereas women with a trauma history in childhood and adulthood or PTSD reported possession more frequently than those without, PNP were associated with childhood trauma only. Factor analysis yielded 4 dimensions: possession by and/or contact with nonhuman entities, extrasensory communications, possession by a human entity, and precognition. These factors correlated with number of secondary features of dissociative identity disorder and Schneiderian symptoms. Latent class analysis identified 3 groups. The most traumatized group, with predominantly dissociative and trauma-related disorders, had the highest scores on all factors. Notwithstanding their presence in healthy individuals, possession and PNP were associated with trauma and dissociation in a subgroup of affected participants. Both types of experience seem to be normal human capacities of experiencing that may be involved in response to traumatic stress. Given the small numbers, this study should be considered preliminary.

"449",3798,"Epidemiological data show that up to 20-30% of patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs), resembling drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), are referred to tertiary epilepsy centers. Furthermore, both disorders present high psychiatric comorbidity, and video-EEG is the gold standard to make differential diagnoses. In this study, we described and compared the clinical presentation and the frequency of psychiatric disorders codified in DSM IV in two groups of patients, one with PNESs and the other with DRE, admitted in a tertiary care epilepsy center of Buenos Aires, Argentina.We included 35 patients with PNESs and 49 with DRE; all were admitted in the video-EEG unit in order to confirm an epilepsy diagnosis and determine surgical treatment possibilities. All patients underwent a neurological and psychiatric assessment, according to standardized protocol (SCID I and II; DSM IV criteria). Student's t test was performed to compare continuous variables and Chi square test to compare qualitative variables.In this study, 33 (67%) patients with DRE and 35 (100%) patients with PNESs met criteria for at least one disorder codified in Axis I of DSM IV (p= 0.003). Differences in the frequency of psychiatric disorder presentation were found between groups.

"450",1368,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the current literature on childhood trauma and emerging treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), one of its most prevalent consequences, in patients with psychotic disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Of patients with psychosis, 40-50% report either childhood sexual abuse or childhood physical abuse, and 11-46% fulfil a diagnosis of PTSD. About one-third of patients report childhood emotional abuse in the absence of other forms of childhood trauma. More robust evidence is mounting to support the role of childhood trauma in the aetiology of psychosis, but more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. Patients with a history of childhood trauma and/or PTSD have a more severe clinical profile compared with those without these experiences, worse overall functioning, and lower remission rates. Research suggests that instruments assessing childhood trauma and PTSD developed for the general population are also appropriate for use among people with psychosis, and trauma-focussed treatments can be used safely and effectively in this group. SUMMARY: Childhood trauma and its consequences are highly prevalent among patients with psychosis and severely affect the course and outcome. Treatment approaches appropriate for this population need to be further evaluated and implemented into routine practice.

"452",1491,"Background: The aims of this study were to examine the level of dissociative symptoms in patients with different substance related disorders (alcohol dependence, drug dependence, and combined alcohol and drug dependence), and to investigate the influence of potentially traumatic events in childhood, age, gender, and posttraumatic stress disorder on the relationship between dissociative symptoms and type of substance abuse. Methods: Of the 459 participants (59.7% male) 182 (39.7%) were alcohol-dependent (A), 154 (33.6%) were drug-dependent (D), and 123 (26.8%) were dependent on both, alcohol and drugs (AD) based on the DSM-IV criteria for a current diagnosis. Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES). The International Diagnostics Checklist (IDCL) was administered to diagnose PTSD. Results: Higher levels of dissociation were observed in patients with drug dependence as compared to patients with mere alcohol dependence (mean DES group A: 9.9 (plus or minus) 8.8; group D: 12.9 (plus or minus) 11.7; group AD: 15.1 (plus or minus) 11.3). However, when severity of potentially traumatic events in childhood, PTSD, age and gender were included in the analysis, the influence of the type of substance abuse did not prove to be statistically significant. The variable most strongly related to dissociative symptoms was severity of potentially traumatic events in childhood, in particular emotional abuse, even after controlling for PTSD and other potential confounders. Conclusions: It seems appropriate to screen SUD patients for dissociative symptoms, especially those with a more complex risk profile including (additional) drug abuse, female gender, younger age and most importantly a history of childhood trauma.

"456",7481,"OBJECTIVE: Up to 20% of patients do not show improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQL) after cardiac surgery, despite apparently successful surgical procedures. We sought to determine whether failed improvements in HRQL after cardiac surgery are associated with the development of traumatic memories and chronic stress states as a result of high perioperative stress exposure. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A 10-bed cardiovascular intensive care unit of a tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 148 cardiac surgical patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients were evaluated for traumatic memories from postoperative treatment in the cardiovascular intensive care unit (defined as the subjective recollection of pain, respiratory distress, anxiety/panic, and nightmares), symptoms of chronic stress, including those of posttraumatic stress disorder, and HRQL preoperatively (at baseline) and at 6 months after cardiac surgery. A state of chronic stress was defined as the development of posttraumatic stress disorder at 6 months after surgery. Factors predicting the decline in HRQL were determined by multivariable linear regression. Twenty-seven patients (18.2%) had posttraumatic stress disorder at 6 months after cardiac surgery; seven of these patients (4.8%) had evidence of preexisting posttraumatic stress disorder before undergoing cardiac surgery. Patients with new posttraumatic stress disorder at 6 months after cardiac surgery had a significantly higher number of traumatic memories from postoperative treatment in the cardiovascular intensive care unit (p =.01). A multiple regression model included the number of traumatic memories from the intensive care unit and stress symptom scores at 6 months after heart surgery as predictors for variations in physical HRQL outcome scores (R2 =.30, p <.04). Stress symptom scores were the most significant predictors of mental health HRQL outcomes (R2 =.52, p <.01).

"458",5806,"PURPOSE: This study was designed to identify factors associated with death by 6 months post-intensive care unit (ICU) discharge and to develop a practical mortality risk score for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-treated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. We also assessed long-term survivors' health-related quality of life (HRQL), respiratory symptoms, and anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequencies. METHODS: Data from 140 ECMO-treated ARDS patients admitted to three French ICUs (2008-2012) were analyzed. ICU survivors contacted >6 months post-ICU discharge were assessed for HRQL, psychological and PTSD status. RESULTS: Main ARDS etiologies were bacterial (45%), influenza A[H(1)N(1)] (26%) and post-operative (17%) pneumonias. Six months post-ICU discharge, 84 (60%) patients were still alive. Based on multivariable logistic regression analysis, the PRESERVE (PRedicting dEath for SEvere ARDS on VV-ECMO) score (0-14 points) was constructed with eight pre-ECMO parameters, i.e. age, body mass index, immunocompromised status, prone positioning, days of mechanical ventilation, sepsis-related organ failure assessment, plateau pressure andpositive end-expiratory pressure. Six-month post-ECMO initiation cumulative probabilities of survival were 97, 79, 54 and 16% for PRESERVE classes 0-2, 3-4, 5-6 and >/=7 (p < 0.001), respectively. HRQL evaluation in 80% of the 6-month survivors revealed satisfactory mental health but persistent physical and emotional-related difficulties, with anxiety, depression or PTSD symptoms reported, by 34, 25 or 16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The PRESERVE score might help ICU physicians select appropriate candidates for ECMO among severe ARDS patients. Future studies should also focus on physical and psychosocial rehabilitation that could lead to improved HRQL in this population.","the preserve mortality risk score and analysis of long-term outcomes after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome",0,0

Its Eastern province of Nangarhar is part of the region that originated the Taliban movement. This may have had a distinct impact on the living circumstances and mental health condition of the province's population. OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate of exposure to traumatic events; estimate prevalence rates of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety; identify resources used for emotional support and risk factors for mental health symptoms; and assess the present coverage of basic needs in Nangarhar province, Afghanistan. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional multicluster sample survey of 1011 respondents aged 15 years or older, conducted in Nangarhar province during January and March 2003; 362 households were represented with a mean of 2.8 respondents per household (72% participation rate).

"462",7269,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is more prevalent in perinatal than general samples of women (6-8% vs. 4-5%). To explore potential causes, we examined the symptom profiles of women belonging to two separate samples: a perinatal clinic sample (n = 1581) and a subsample of women in a similar age range from the U. S. National Women's Study (NWS) (n = 2000). Within the perinatal sample, risk ratios were higher for all 17 PTSD symptoms among women with current PTSD compared with unaffected women, suggesting that higher rates are not likely due to measurement error. The younger age and greater social disadvantage in the perinatal clinic sample contributed only a small proportion of variance in symptom levels compared with extent of trauma exposure and pre-existing PTSD. Compared with the national study sample's symptom profile, the perinatal sample had higher rates of occurrence of five symptoms: detachment, loss of interest, anger and irritability, trouble sleeping, and nightmares. This analysis confirms that PTSD rates are higher in perinatal samples, which is likely due to exacerbation of pre-existing PTSD among women of a younger age and greater social disadvantage.

"466",12925,"Objective: To determine the range and severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms exhibited by children after exposure to a natural disaster. Method: Three months after Hurricane Hugo struck Berkeley County, South Carolina, 5,687 school-aged children were surveyed about their experiences and reactions related to the storm. Self-reports of PTSD symptoms were obtained by use of a PTSD Reaction Index. Results: Significant variation in the prevalence of PTSD symptoms was found across race, gender, and age groups. Self-reported symptoms were used to derive a post-traumatic stress syndrome classification according to DSM-III-R guidelines for the diagnosis of PTSD. More than 5% of the sample reported sufficient symptoms to be classified as exhibiting this post-traumatic stress syndrome. Females and younger children were more likely to receive this classification. At the symptom level, females reported more symptoms associated with emotional processing and emotional reaction to the trauma. Males were more likely to report symptoms related to cognitive and behavioral factors. Younger children were more likely to report symptoms overall. Conclusions: Children exposed to a high magnitude natural disaster report sufficient symptoms to establish a DSM-III-R derived classification of a PTSD syndrome.

"468",12926,"Objective Identified patterns of connectedness in youth with cancer and demographically similar healthy peers. Method Participants included 153 youth with a history of cancer and 101 youth without a history of serious illness (8-19 years). Children completed measures of connectedness, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and benefit-finding. Parents also reported on children's PTSS. Results Latent profile analysis revealed four profiles: high connectedness (45%), low connectedness (6%), connectedness primarily to parents (40%), and connectedness primarily to peers (9%). These profiles did not differ by history of cancer. However, profiles differed on PTSS and benefit-finding. Children highly connected across domains displayed the lowest PTSS and highest benefit-finding, while those with the lowest connectedness had the highest PTSS, with moderate PTSS and benefit-finding for the parent and peer profiles.

"469",12926,"Objective Identified patterns of connectedness in youth with cancer and demographically similar healthy peers. Method Participants included 153 youth with a history of cancer and 101 youth without a history of serious illness (8-19 years). Children completed measures of connectedness, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and benefit-finding. Parents also reported on children's PTSS. Results Latent profile analysis revealed four profiles: high connectedness (45%), low connectedness (6%), connectedness primarily to parents (40%), and connectedness primarily to peers (9%). These profiles did not differ by history of cancer. However, profiles differed on PTSS and benefit-finding. Children highly connected across domains displayed the lowest PTSS and highest benefit-finding, while those with the lowest connectedness had the highest PTSS, with moderate PTSS and benefit-finding for the parent and peer profiles.

"470",225,"This study conducted secondary analyses of a published trial and sought to determine if different domains of psychosocial functioning (e.g., daily living, work, nonfamily relationships) improved following trauma-focused treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cognitive processing therapy (CPT), an empirically supported treatment that involves evaluating trauma-related beliefs and written trauma accounts, was compared to its components: CPT without the written accounts or written accounts only in a sample of 78 women with PTSD secondary to interpersonal violence. Overall and individual domains of functioning significantly improved with treatment and results were similar across treatment groups, Fs (2, 150) ≥ 11.87, ps < .001. Additionally, we investigated whether changes in different PTSD symptom clusters were associated with outcomes in domains of psychosocial functioning, after collapsing across treatment condition. Multiple hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed that overall clinician-assessed PTSD symptom reduction was associated with outcomes in all domains of functioning, βs = .44 to .68, ps < .001. Additionally, improvements in the emotional numbing symptom cluster were associated with outcomes in the nonfamily relationships domain, β = .42, p < .001, and improvements in the hyperarousal symptom cluster were associated with outcomes in the overall, daily living, and household tasks domains, βs = .34 to .39, ps < .01. Results suggest that it may be important to monitor improvements in emotional numbing and hyperarousal symptoms throughout treatment to increase the likelihood of changes in psychosocial functioning.","associations between functioning and ptsd symptom clusters in a dismantling trial of cognitive processing therapy in female interpersonal violence survivors",0,0

"478",107,"Objective: Combat stress exposed soldiers may respond to post-deployment stressful life events (SLE) with increases in symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), consistent with a model of stress sensitization. Several lines of research point to sensitization as a model to describe the relations between exposure to traumatic events, subsequent SLE, and symptoms of PTSD. Based on previous findings we hypothesized that immune activation, measured as a high in vitro capacity of leukocytes to produce cytokines upon stimulation, underlies stress sensitization. Methods: We assessed mitogen-induced cytokine production at 1 month, SLE at 1 year, and PTSD symptoms from 1 month up to 2 years post-deployment in soldiers returned from deployment to Afghanistan ( N = 693). Exploratory structural equation modeling as well as latent growth models were applied. Results: The data demonstrated significant three-way interaction effects of combat stress exposure, cytokine production, and post-deployment SLE on linear change in PTSD symptoms over the first 2 years following return from deployment. In soldiers reporting high combat stress exposure, both high mitogen-stimulated T-cell cytokine production and high innate cytokine production were associated with increases in PTSD symptoms in response to post-deployment SLE. In low combat stress exposed soldiers as well as those with low cytokine production, post-deployment SLE were not associated with increases in PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: High stimulated T-cell and innate cytokine production may contribute to stress sensitization in recently deployed, high combat stress exposed soldiers. These findings suggest that detecting and eventually normalizing immune activation may potentially complement future strategies to prevent progression of PTSD symptoms following return from deployment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","cytokine production as a putative biological mechanism underlying stress sensitization in high combat exposed soldiers",0,0

"482",7300,"CONTEXT: Millions of Cambodians suffered profound trauma during the Khmer Rouge era (1975 to 1979). A joint United Nations-Cambodian tribunal (the ""Khmer Rouge trials"") was empanelled in 2006 to prosecute top Khmer Rouge leaders and began substantive hearings in March 2009. OBJECTIVES: To establish the prevalence of probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among adult Cambodians and to assess correlates of PTSD symptoms and disability with perceived justice, desire for revenge, and knowledge of and attitudes toward the trials. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A national probability sample of 1017 Cambodians was assembled using a multistage, stratified cluster design, including 813 adults older than 35 years who had been at least 3 years old during the Khmer Rouge era and 204 adults aged 18 to 35 years who had not been exposed to the Khmer Rouge era. Face-to-face interviews were conducted between December 2006 and August 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of probable PTSD using the PTSD Checklist, Civilian version (cutoff score of 44), and mental and physical disability using the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short Form Health Survey. RESULTS: The prevalence of current probable PTSD was 11.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6%-13.9%) overall and 7.9% (95% CI, 3.8%-12.0%) among the younger group and 14.2% (95% CI, 11.0%-17.3%) in the older group. Probable PTSD was significantly associated with mental disability (40.2% vs 7.9%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 7.80; 95% CI, 3.90-15.60) and physical disability (39.6% vs 20.1%; AOR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.26-5.39). Although Cambodians were hopeful that the trials would promote justice, 87.2% (n = 681) of those older than 35 years believed that the trials would create painful memories for them. In multivariate analysis, respondents with high levels of perceived justice for violations during the Khmer Rouge era were less likely to have probable PTSD than those with low levels (7.4% vs 12.7%; AOR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34-0.86). Respondents with high levels of desire for revenge were more likely to have probable PTSD than those with low levels (12.0% vs 7.2%), but the difference was not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis (AOR, 1.76; 95% CI, 0.99-3.11). CONCLUSIONS: Probable PTSD is common and associated with disability in Cambodia. Although Cambodians had positive attitudes toward the trials, most were concerned that the trials would bring back painful memories. Now that the trials have begun, longitudinal research is needed to determine the impact of the trials on Cambodians' mental health.","probable posttraumatic stress disorder and disability in cambodia: associations with perceived justice, desire for revenge, and attitudes toward the khmer rouge trials",0,0

The aim of the study was to assess the extensiveness and characteristics of domestic violence in the group of Slovenian adolescents. Subjects: 1297 young adolescents (age 13-15 years) from 65 Slovenian primary schools participated in the study. Methods: A questionnaire for domestic violence experience and help seeking screening, McMaster Family Functioning Scale, Buss/Perry Aggression Questionnaire and Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children_TM (TSCC_TM) have been applied. Results: 18,7% of participants experienced violence in their own family (38,3% males and 61,7% females). Different patterns of verbal violence, irritability and indirect violence predominated. In the most cases of domestic violence the adolescent's parents were involved as perpetrators and their close relatives (brothers, sisters). Victims displayed a significant profile that could be linked with their violence experience: dysfunctional family environmental, aggressiveness, anxiety, depression, anger and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Conclusions: Presented study confirmed that the phenomenon of domestic violence and abused adolescents is quite widespread in Slovenia and that in the future more attention on research and policy making level should be given to this phenomenon. Particularly the perceived gap between attitudes towards support and the actually given help could be the orientation for developing a better prevention strategies and screening procedures for domestic violence.

"486",6192,"This study examined the association between somatic complaints and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in treatment-seeking Canadian military personnel with military-related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Current and former Canadian Forces (CF) members attending the Parkwood Hospital Operational Stress Injury Clinic in London, Ontario (N=291) were administered self-report questionnaires assessing number and severity of somatic complaints, PTSD and depressive symptom severity, and mental and physical health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) prior to commencing treatment. Regression analyses were used to identify the role of somatic complaints on physical and mental HR-QoL, after controlling for PTSD symptom cluster and depressive symptom severity. Somatic symptom severity accounted for only a small amount of the variance in mental HR-QoL after accounting for PTSD symptom cluster and depressive symptom severity, but accounted for a larger proportion of the variance in physical HR-QoL after accounting for PTSD cluster and depressive symptom severity. Understanding the role of somatization in the symptom-presentation of military personnel with PTSD may provide additional avenues for treatment with this population.","somatic symptoms and health-related quality of life among treatment-seeking canadian forces personnel with ptsd",0,0
"487",2045,"Recent in vitro evidence indicates that astrocytes can modulate synaptic plasticity by releasing neuroactive substances (gliotransmitters). However, whether gliotransmitter release from astrocytes is necessary for higher brain function in vivo, particularly for memory, as well as the contribution of connexin (Cx) hemichannels to gliotransmitter release, remain elusive. Here, we microinfused into the rat basolateral amygdala (BLA) TAT-Cx43L2, a peptide that selectively inhibits Cx43-hemichannel opening while maintaining synaptic transmission or interastrocyte gap junctional communication. In vivo blockade of Cx43 hemichannels during memory consolidation induced amnesia for auditory fear conditioning, as assessed 24 h after training, without affecting short-term memory, locomotion, or shock reactivity. The amnesic effect was transitory, specific for memory consolidation, and was confirmed after microinfusion of Gap27, another Cx43-hemichannel blocker. Learning capacity was recovered after coinfusion of TAT-Cx43L2 and a mixture of putative gliotransmitters (glutamate, glutamine, lactate, D-serine, glycine, and ATP). We propose that gliotransmitter release from astrocytes through Cx43 hemichannels is necessary for fear memory consolidation at the BLA. Thus, the present study is the first to demonstrate a physiological role for astroglial Cx43 hemichannels in brain function, making these channels a novel pharmacological target for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder.

"489",6218,"BACKGROUND: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) three-factor posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic criteria was conducted to determine fit for this patient population. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of alternate symptom structures was planned to identify symptoms that cluster in this population. The response of symptom factors to treatment with venlafaxine extended release (ER) was explored. METHODS: Baseline 17-item Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-SX17) data were pooled from patients enrolled in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The CFA was conducted using maximum likelihood and weighted, least-squares factor extraction methods. The EFA was performed using a polychoric correlation covariance matrix and Pearson correlation matrix. RESULTS: Data from a pooled population of 685 patients (venlafaxine ER: n = 339; placebo: n = 346) were analyzed. CFA rejected the DSM-IV three-factor structure. The EFA identified a different three-factor structure as the best fit: factor 1 included reexperiencing symptoms, factor 2 included symptoms of altered mood and cognition, whereas factor 3 comprised avoidance and arousal symptoms. All DSM-IV symptom factors and all factors in the identified three-factor model responded positively to venlafaxine ER treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Data are consistent with literature failing to confirm the three-factor structure of DSM-IV PTSD, and they support the DSM-5 inclusion of a symptom cluster addressing altered mood and cognition in PTSD. The efficacy of venlafaxine ER in reducing a range of symptom clusters in PTSD is consistent with its multiple mechanisms of action.","a factor analysis of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms using data pooled from two venlafaxine extended-release clinical trials",0,0

The efficacy of venlafaxine ER in reducing a range of symptom clusters in PTSD is consistent with its multiple mechanisms of action. © 2013 The Authors.","a factor analysis of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms using data pooled from two venlafaxine extended-release clinical trials",0,0
"491",1705,"Aim: The occurrence and course of PTSD in the countryside environment as the result of flood in 1997 has been described. The research was experimented around four villages by Nysa Klodzka river-basin; the area was affected by disaster unexpectedly and extremely hard. Method: 97 people have been tested as the straightforward witnesses of flood. They had never been treated by a psychiatrist before 1997 and they haven't experienced any other stressful event that might have been an independent reason of the occurrence PTSD. The extent of trauma, risk of shock and the length of time that those examined were in danger was identical. None of the stiudied had received psychological or psychiatrical support after the disaster. The research was carried out by one investigator (psychiatrist) 60-63 months after the flood at the victims' houses (the psychiatrist's visit was preceded by the phone appointment). The research instrument- Composite International Diagnostic Interview CIDI: section A (referred to demographic dates) and section N (referred to PTSD). Results: PTSD diagnosis was made in 30.9% of the examined group. The distempered people are mostly educated at the lowest level (49.9% with the ground education) or unemployed (39.2%). Older people were more susceptible to PTSD. PTSD diagnosis was made more often for men (39.5%) than for women (25.4), what is directly related to the lower education and a worse material status of the examined men. Full symptomatic PTSD, remaining up to 60-63 months after the flood, was confirmed in 15.5% of the studied group. Conclusion: The frequency and profile of PTSD occurrence (lower educated, older and the poor people) in the examined group is consistent with the other studies done. The fact that PTSD diagnosis was more frequent amongst men (39.5% vs. 25.4% in women) has been mentioned and explained above. No person in the group has confirmed the short (lasting only up to one month) term of persistence of the symptoms what is tantamount to no acute stress disorder right after the flood. It might be probably caused by the permanence of flood destruction and the prolonged exposure to the stress factor.","ptsd as result of flood in 1997 - occurrence and display of distemper",0,0

"493",6452,"OBJECTIVE: To examine street victimization and posttraumatic stress symptoms among urban homeless adolescents and to test whether emotional numbing and avoidance represent distinct posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters. METHOD: Structured, private interviews were conducted with homeless adolescents (N = 374) in the Seattle metropolitan area (95% response rate) from 1995 to 1998. RESULTS: Eighty-three percent of street youths were physically and/or sexually victimized after leaving home. Approximately 18% of these youths met research criteria for PTSD. Results from a confirmatory factor analysis suggest that disaggregating symptoms of avoidance from symptoms of emotional numbing provides a better fit of the data than the current DSM-IV model in which these symptoms are combined in one factor. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual and physical victimization are serious threats for homeless adolescents, and those who are victimized are at risk for PTSD. Results challenge the belief that symptoms of avoidance and numbing represent one unified cluster in this population.","victimization and posttraumatic stress disorder among homeless adolescents",0,0

"495",11282,"Reviews the book, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder edited by Dan J. Stein et al. (see record 2011-21915-000). This is the best current academic book on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that I know of. Its strengths are its evidence-based reviews of nosology, neurobiology, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and disaster mental health. It includes theoretical approaches in biological, developmental, psychological, and psychosocial dimensions. It addresses factors both in vulnerability and in resilience. Each chapter includes commentaries by experts, who give added perspective. The references, from a huge literature, are selective, current, extensive, and excellent. This is a fine book. For those treating patients with PTSD, conducting research, or involved in disaster psychiatry, this is essential reading, and worth owning.

"496",5945,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with decreased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the brain region that regulates working memory and preparation and selection of fear responses. We investigated gene expression profiles in DLPFC Brodmann area (BA) 46 of postmortem patients with (n=6) and without PTSD (n=6) using human mitochondria-focused cDNA microarrays. Our study revealed PTSD-specific expression fingerprints of 800 informative mitochondria-focused genes across all of these 12 BA46 samples, and 119 (+/->1.25, p<0.05) and 42 (+/->1.60, p<0.05) dysregulated genes between the PTSD and control samples. Quantitative RT-PCR validated the microarray results. These fingerprints can essentially distinguish the PTSD DLPFC BA46 brains from controls. Of the 119 dysregulated genes (+/-> or =125%, p<0.05), the highest percentages were associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (4.8%, p=6.61 x 10(-6)), oxidative phosphorylation (3.8%, p=9.04 x 10(-4)), cell survival-apoptosis (25.2%, p<0.05) and neurological diseases (23.5%, p<0.05). Fifty (50) dysregulated genes were present in the molecular networks that are known to be involved in neuronal function-survival and contain 7 targets for neuropsychiatric drugs. Thirty (30) of the dysregulated genes are associated with a number of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Method: In the prospective, naturalistic Jorvi Bipolar Study of 191 secondary care psychiatric in- and out-patients, 160 patients (85.1%) could be followed up for 18 months with a life chart. Results: After adjusting for confounders, no marked differences in illness-related characteristics were found. However, female patients with BD had more lifetime comorbid eating disorders (P < 0.001, OR = 5.99, 95% CI 2.12-16.93) but less substance use disorders (P < 0.001, OR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.16-0.56) than males.

"500",4115,"Background and aims: Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) and atypical facial pain (AFP) are often persistent idiopathic pain conditions that mainly affect middle-aged and elderly women. They have both been associated with various psychiatric disorders. This study examined current and lifetime prevalence of psychiatric axis I (symptom-based) and II (personality) disorders in patients with chronic idiopathic orofacial pain, and investigated the temporal relationship of psychiatric disorders and the onset of orofacial pain. Method: Forty patients with BMS and 23 patients with AFP were recruited from Turku university hospital clinics. Mean age of the patients was 62.3 years (range 35-84) and 90% were female. BMS and AFP diagnoses were based on thorough clinical evaluation, and all patients had undergone clinical neurophysiological investigations including blink reflex and thermal quantitative tests. Current and lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses of axis I and II disorders were made on clinical basis with the aid of SCID-I and II-interviews. The detected prevalence rates and their 95% confidence intervals based on binomial distribution were compared to three previous large population-based studies. Results: Of the 63 patients, 26 (41.3%) had had an axis I disorder that preceded the onset of orofacial pain, and 33 (52.4%) had had a lifetime axis I disorder. Rate of current axis I disorders was 36.5%, indicating that only about 16% of lifetime disorders had remitted, and they tended to run chronic course. The most common lifetime axis I disorders were major depression (30.2%), social phobia (15.9%), specific phobia (11.1%), and panic disorder (7.9%). Twelve patients (19.0%) had at least one cluster C personality disorder already before the emergence of orofacial pain. Patients with cluster C personality disorders are characterized as fearful and neurotic. None of the patients had cluster A (characterized as odd and eccentric) or B (characterized as dramatic, emotional or erratic) personality disorders. The most common personality disorders were obsessive-compulsive personality (14.3%), dependent personality (4.8%), and avoidant personality (3.2%). The majority of the patients (54%) had also one or more chronic pain conditions other than orofacial pain. In almost all patients (94%) they were already present at the onset of orofacial pain. Conclusions: Our results suggest that major depression, persistent social phobia, and neurotic, fearful, and obsessive-compulsive personality characteristics are common in patients with chronic idiopathic orofacial pain. Most psychiatric disorders precede the onset of orofacial pain and they tend to run a chronic course. Implications: We propose that the high psychiatric morbidity, and comorbidity to other chronic pain conditions, in chronic idiopathic orofacial pain can be best understood in terms of shared vulnerability to both chronic pain and specific psychiatric disorders, most likely mediated by dysfunctional brain dopamine activity.

These groups have been found to predict functional severity and psychiatric comorbidity. In this study, we employed Latent Profile Analysis to compare this previously established typology, grounded in temperament traits (negative emotionality; positive emotionality; constraint), to a novel typology rooted in interpersonal traits (dominance; warmth) in a sample of individuals with PTSD (n = 155). Using Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality (SNAP) traits to create latent profiles, the 3-group temperament model was replicated. Using Interpersonal Circumplex (IPC) traits to create latent profiles, we identified a 4-group solution with groups varying in interpersonal style. These models were nonredundant, indicating that the depiction of personality variability in PTSD depends on how personality is assessed. Whereas the temperament model was more effective for distinguishing individuals based on distress and comorbid disorders, the interpersonal model was more effective for predicting the chronicity of PTSD over the 10 year course of the study. We discuss the potential for integrating these complementary temperament and interpersonal typologies in the clinical assessment of PTSD.","personality heterogeneity in ptsd: distinct temperament and interpersonal typologies",0,0

"514",12979,"Disaster work has shown to cause PTSD symptoms and subjective health complaints in professional emergency personnel. However, very little is known about how disaster work affects community volunteers. This first time longitudinal study examined factors contributing to post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD) and subjective health complaints in volunteers working in an earthquake setting. At six and eighteen months post disaster, a sample of 506 Indonesian Red Cross volunteers were assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Subjective Health Complaints Inventory. Factors analyzed in relation to the outcomes included: peri-traumatic distress, level of personal affectedness by the disaster, sleep quality and loss of resources as a consequence of the disaster. At 18 months post-disaster the findings showed high levels of PTSD symptoms and subjective health complaints. Quality of sleep was related to both outcomes but resource loss only to PTSD symptoms. Neither peri-traumatic distress nor level of affectedness by the disaster (external versus directly affected volunteers), were predictive of symptoms. This study indicates that characteristics of disaster work e.g. low quality of sleep, may be an important contributor to PTSD symptoms and subjective health complaints in volunteers.

"516",12983,"Introduction: Exposure to armed conflict produces biological adaptations oriented to handle the highly stressful conditions in war environments. The special features of The Colombian armed create a special scenario to evaluate the human behavior. Objective: In this study, psychiatric, cognitive and emotional processing characteristics of a group of Colombian armed illegal forces of ex-combatants are described. Methods: Sixty-three ex combatants and 22 controls were assessed with WAIS (IQ), INECO frontal screening (executive functions), Interpersonal Reactivity Index (empathy), emotional features recognition and MINI (psychiatric profile). Results: When compared to the control group, ex-combatants showed higher frequency of antisocial personality disorder (P=.031) and behavioral dissocial disorder (P=.017). In cognitive profile, the ex-combatants showed a lower score in the executive function test (Me =18.50; RQ =4.00), control (Me =23.00; RQ =5.25), with a poor personal distress in emphatic profile (Me =10.00; RQ =5.00) compared to control group (Me =37.00; RQ =7.25).

"517",7238,"OBJECTIVE: The authors examined moderators and mediators of a school-based psychosocial intervention for children affected by political violence, according to an ecological resilience theoretical framework. METHOD: The authors examined data from a cluster randomized trial, involving children aged 8-13 in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia (treatment condition n = 182, waitlist control condition n = 221). Mediators (hope, coping, peer/emotional/play social support) and moderators (gender, age, family connectedness, household size, other forms of social support, exposure to political violence, and displacement) of treatment outcome on posttraumatic stress symptoms and function impairment were examined in parallel process latent growth curve models. RESULTS: Compared with the waitlist group, those receiving treatment showed maintained hope, increased positive coping, maintained peer social support, and increased play social support. Of these putative mediators, only play social support was found to mediate treatment effects, such that increases in play social support were associated with smaller reductions in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Furthermore, the authors identified a number of moderators: Girls showed larger treatment benefits on PTSD symptoms; girls, children in smaller households, and children receiving social support from adults outside the household showed larger treatment benefits on function impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide limited evidence for an ecological resilience theoretical framework. On the basis of these findings, the authors recommend a stronger separation between universal prevention (e.g., resilience promotion through play) and selective/indicated prevention (e.g., interventions aimed at decreasing posttraumatic stress symptoms).

"518",7020,"BACKGROUND: Armed conflicts are associated with a wide range of impacts on the mental health of children and adolescents. We evaluated the effectiveness of a school-based intervention aimed at reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety (treatment aim); and improving a sense of hope and functioning (preventive aim). METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized trial with 329 children in war-affected Burundi (aged 8 to 17 (mean 12.29 years, standard deviation 1.61); 48% girls). One group of children (n = 153) participated in a 15-session school-based intervention implemented by para-professionals, and the remaining 176 children formed a waitlist control condition. Outcomes were measured before, one week after, and three months after the intervention. RESULTS: No main effects of the intervention were identified. However, longitudinal growth curve analyses showed six favorable and two unfavorable differences in trajectories between study conditions in interaction with several moderators. Children in the intervention condition living in larger households showed decreases on depressive symptoms and function impairment, and those living with both parents showed decreases on posttraumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms. The groups of children in the waitlist condition showed increases in depressive symptoms. In addition, younger children and those with low levels of exposure to traumatic events in the intervention condition showed improvements on hope. Children in the waitlist condition who lived on their original or newly bought land showed improvements in hope and function impairment, whereas children in the intervention condition showed deterioration on these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Given inconsistent effects across studies, findings do not support this school-based intervention as a treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms in conflict-affected children. The intervention appears to have more consistent preventive benefits, but these effects are contingent upon individual (for example, age, gender) and contextual (for example, family functioning, state of conflict, displacement) variables.

Childhood mental health problems are difficult to address in situations of ongoing poverty and political instability. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a school-based intervention designed for conflict-exposed children, implemented in a low-income setting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cluster randomized trial involving 495 children (81.4% inclusion rate) who were a mean (SD) age of 9.9 (1.3) years, were attending randomly selected schools in political violence-affected communities in Poso, Indonesia, and were screened for exposure (> or = 1 events), posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety symptoms compared with a wait-listed control group. Nonblinded assessment took place before, 1 week after, and 6 months after treatment between March and December 2006. INTERVENTION: Fifteen sessions, over 5 weeks, of a manualized, school-based group intervention, including trauma-processing activities, cooperative play, and creative-expressive elements, implemented by locally trained paraprofessionals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed psychiatric symptoms using the Child Posttraumatic Stress Scale, Depression Self-Rating Scale, the Self-Report for Anxiety Related Disorders 5-item version, and the Children's Hope Scale, and assessed function impairment as treatment outcomes using standardized symptom checklists and locally developed rating scales. RESULTS: Correcting for clustering of participants within schools, we found significantly more improvement in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (mean change difference, 2.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 4.53) and maintained hope (mean change difference, -2.21; 95% CI, -3.52 to -0.91) in the treatment group than in the wait-listed group.

The study aims were to: 1) estimate the prevalence of PD with or without AG (PD), AG without panic (AG) and PD and/or AG (PD/AG) in a large clinical sample of OCD patients and 2) compare the characteristics of individuals with and without these comorbid conditions. METHOD: A cross-sectional study with 1001 patients of the Brazilian Research Consortium on Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorders using several assessment instruments, including the Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders. Bivariate analyses were followed by logistic regression models. RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence of PD was 15.3% (N=153), of AG 4.9% (N=49), and of PD/AG 20.2% (N=202). After logistic regression, hypochondriasis and specific phobia were common correlates of the three study groups. PD comorbidity was also associated with higher levels of anxiety, having children, major depression, bipolar I, generalized anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorders. Other independent correlates of AG were: dysthymia, bipolar II disorder, social phobia, impulsive-compulsive internet use, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. Patients with PD/AG were also more likely to be married and to present high anxiety, separation anxiety disorder, major depression, impulsive-compulsive internet use, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress and binge eating disorders.

"529",154,"Objective:To characterize predominant typologies of co-occurring personality disorders among adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and examine their relation to Axis I comorbidities, health-related quality of life, and course and treatment of PTSD. Method: Latent class analysis was conducted on the 10 DSM-/V personality disorders in a nationally representative sample of 2,463 adults with a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD from Wave 2 (2004-2005) of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Results:Three latent classes of personality disorders were identified: a borderline- dysregulated class (11.4%), an obsessive-paranoid class (13.1%), and a no/low personality disorders class (75.5%). The borderline-dysregulated and obsessive-paranoid classes were more likely than the no/low personality disorder class to have a broad range of comorbid Axis I diagnoses and to have ever attempted suicide (ORs= 1.50-8.01), and they reported lower mental health-related quality of life. The borderline-dysregulated class was less likely than the no/low personality disorder class to have experienced remission of their most recent episode of PTSD (OR=0.54; 95% Cl, 0.38-0.75) and was more likely to have been prescribed medication for PTSD (OR= 1.65; 95% Cl, 1.20-2.28) and to have used alcohol and drugs to mitigate their PTSD symptoms (OR = 2.77; 95% Cl, 1.62-4.74). The obsessive-paranoid class was more likely than the no/low personality disorders class to report sexual assault as their worst trauma (OR=2.22; 95% Cl, 1.36-3.61) and had an earlier age at onset of PTSD symptoms compared to the other 2 classes.

"531",6339,"A key assumption in the study of stress-induced cognitive and neurobiological modifications is that alterations in hippocampal functioning after stress are due to an excessive activity exerted by the amygdala on the hippocampus. Research so far focused on stress-induced impairment of hippocampal plasticity and memory but an exposure to stress may simultaneously also result in strong emotional memories. In fact, under normal conditions emotionally charged events are better remembered compared with neutral ones. Results indicate that under these conditions there is an increase in activity within the amygdala that may lead to memory of a different quality. Studying the way emotionality activates the amygdala and the functional impact of this activation we found that the amygdala modulates memory-related processes in other brain areas, such as the hippocampus. However, this modulation is complex, involving both enhancing and suppressing effects, depending on the way the amygdala is activated and the hippocampal subregion examined. The current review summarizes our findings and attempts to put them in context with the impact of an exposure to a traumatic experience, in which there is a mixture of a strong memory of some aspects of the experience but impaired memory of other aspects of that experience. Toward that end, we have recently developed an animal model for the induction of predisposition to stress-related disorders, focusing on the consequences of exposure to stressors during juvenility on the ability to cope with stress in adulthood. Exposing juvenile-stressed rats to an additional stressful challenge in adulthood revealed their impairment to cope with stress and resulted in significant elevation of the amygdala. Interestingly, and similar to our electrophysiological findings, differential effects were observed between the impact of the emotional challenge on CA1 and dentate gyrus subregions of the hippocampus. Taken together, the results indicate that long-term alterations within the amygdala contribute to stress-related mnemonic symptoms and suggest that elucidating further these intra-amygdala alterations and their effects on modulating other brain regions is likely to be beneficial for the development of novel approaches to treat stress-related disorders.","amygdala modulation of memory-related processes in the hippocampus: potential relevance to ptsd",0,0
"532",1517,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with neuropsychological impairments across multiple domains, but consensus regarding the cognitive profile of PTSD has not been reached. In this study of women with PTSD related to intimate partner violence (n = 55) and healthy, demographically similar comparison participants (NCs; n = 20), we attempted to control for many potential confounds in PTSD samples. All participants were assessed with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery emphasizing executive functioning, including inhibition, switching, and abstraction. NCs outperformed PTSD participants on most neuropsychological measures, but the differences were significant only on speeded tasks (with and without executive functioning components). The PTSD group's mean performance was within the average range on all neuropsychological tests. Within the PTSD group, more severe PTSD symptoms were associated with slower processing speed, and more severe dissociative symptoms were associated with poorer reasoning performance. These results suggest that women with PTSD related to intimate partner violence demonstrate slower than normal processing speed, which is associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms. We speculate that the cognitive slowing seen in PTSD may be attributable to reduced attention due to a need to allocate resources to cope with psychological distress or unpleasant internal experiences.

"534",12998,"The etiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) likely involves the interaction of numerous genes and environmental factors. Similarly, gene-expression levels in peripheral blood are influenced by both genes and environment, and expression levels of many genes show good correspondence between peripheral blood and brain tissues. In that context, this pilot study sought to test the following hypotheses: (1) post-trauma expression levels of a gene subset in peripheral blood would differ between Marines with and without PTSD; (2) a diagnostic biomarker panel of PTSD among high-risk individuals could be developed based on gene-expression in readily assessable peripheral blood cells; and (3) a diagnostic panel based on expression of individual exons would surpass the accuracy of a model based on expression of full-length gene transcripts. Gene-expression levels in peripheral blood samples from 50 U.S. Marines (25 PTSD cases and 25 non-PTSD comparison subjects) were determined by microarray following their return from deployment to war-zones in Iraq or Afghanistan. The original sample was carved into training and test subsets for construction of support vector machine classifiers. The panel of peripheral blood biomarkers achieved 80% prediction accuracy in the test subset based on the expression of just two full-length transcripts (GSTM1 and GSTM2).

"536",13003,"(from the chapter) Women have a higher susceptibility than men to a set of psychosocial factors that have been linked to increased risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD), such as depression, early life adversities, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this chapter we discuss the notion that these psychosocial risk factors, particularly if they are present at young age, may set a trajectory of increased IHD risk in women, even though clinical events may occur years later Emerging data suggest that young women are uniquely susceptible to the adverse cardiovascular effects psychosocial stress, which can result in earlier onset of IHD or more adverse prognosis if the disease is already manifest. Women's vulnerability to psychosocial stress could also play a role in sex differences in the pathophysiology of IHD; for example it could help explain their higher propensity to abnormal coronary vasomotion and micro-vascular disease, which has been described in women compared with men. Young women are severely under-represented in studies of cardiovascular disease. In future research, it will be crucial to study women earlier in their life to better understand the risk pathways linking psychosocial stress to IHD risk, in order to devise successful preventive and treatment strategies to ameliorate such risk.

"537",1360,"Background. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an emerging risk factor for CHD, but is comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD), an established CHD risk factor. We sought to determine the relative contributions of PTSD and MDD to CHD risk. Methods. We conducted a prospective study of monozygotic and dizygotic middle-aged male twins of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Lifetime diagnoses of PTSD and MDD were assessed at baseline in 1990-1991 with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Among twin pairs free of CHD at baseline, we selected three groups: 1) pairs discordant for PTSD, 2) pairs discordant for MDD, 3) pairs without a history of PTSD or MDD. These underwent a follow-up clinic visit and [N13]PET myocardial perfusion imaging between 2002-2010 (median follow-up 15 yr). Outcomes included CHD (previous myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and coronary revascularization) and stress total severity score (STSS) quantifying myocardial perfusion abnormalities. GEE and mixed models were used to account for pair cluster and to separate between- and within-pair effects. Results. A total of 540 twins (270 pairs) were included, with mean age at baseline of 41 yr (range 34-48). Of these, 110 pairs were discordant for a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD and 109 for MDD. The incidence of CHD was higher in twins with PTSD only (23%) or PTSD and MDD (21%), intermediate for those with MDD only (13%) and lowest for those with neither (8%). When PTSD and MDD were included in the same model adjusting for demographic and behavioral factors, the relative risk for PTSD was 1.9 (p=0.01), and for MDD it was 1.3 (p=0.22). Within twin pair results were similar with RRs of 1.8 (p=0.03) for PTSD and 1.2 (p=0.54) for MDD. PTSD, but not MDD, was also associated with higher STSS, denoting more perfusion defects. The mean STSS was 162 in twins with PTSD and 110 in their brothers without PTSD (p=0.01). Corresponding results for MDD were 115 and 131 (p=0.43). Conclusions. Among Vietnam era veterans, PTSD is a more robust risk factor for CHD than MDD.

"538",1322,"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction resulting from exposure to severe psychological stress. It has long been hypothesized that PTSD increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) but empirical evidence is limited. Additionally, few studies have accounted for the confounding effect of major depression, which often concur with PTSD and is an established CHD risk factor. We sought to determine the relative contributions of PTSD and major depression to CHD risk in a prospective study of twins. Methods. Monozygotic and dizygotic middle-aged male twins included in the study were members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Lifetime diagnoses of PTSD and major depression were assessed at baseline in 1992 with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Among twin pairs free of CHD at baseline, we selected three groups: 1) pairs dis cordant for PTSD, 2) pairs discordant for major depression, 3) pairs without a history of PTSD or major depression.

"539",631,"Background: While dimensional models of psychopathology have delineated two broad factors underlying common mental disorders-internalizing and externalizing-it is unclear where bipolar disorder and nonaffective psychoses fit in relation to this structure and to each other. Given their low prevalence rates in the general population, these disorders generally tend to be excluded from such models. The current study used the person-centered approach of latent class analysis (LCA) to evaluate this question. Sampling and Methods: LCA of diagnostic data from an epidemiological sample, the National Comorbidity Survey (n = 5,877), was undertaken. Diagnoses utilized in analyses included mania, nonaffective psychoses, specific phobia, social phobia, agoraphobia, panic disorder, major depression, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol dependence, drug dependence, and conduct disorder. Results: Results indicated that a 5-class LCA model optimally fit the data. Four of the classes mirrored those found in dimensional models-a class with few disorders, and 3 others with primarily fear, distress, and externalizing disorders. However, the fifth class-which is not evident in dimensional models-was unique in that it was the only one in which individuals demonstrated significant probabilities of both manic episodes and nonaffective psychoses in addition to markedly high levels of internalizing and externalizing disorders.

A semiparametric group-based model was used to identify trajectories of disruptive behavior in 1,513 girls from age 6 to 12 years. Adjustment problems were characterized by depression, self-harm, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), substance use, interpersonal aggression, sexual behavior, affiliation with delinquent peers, and academic achievement at ages 13 and 14. RESULTS: Three trajectories of childhood disruptive behavior were identified: low, medium, and high. Girls in the high group were at increased risk for depression, self-harm, PTSD, illegal substance use, interpersonal aggression, early and risky sexual behavior, and lower academic achievement. The likelihood of multiple adjustment problems increased with trajectories reflecting higher levels of disruptive behavior.

"543",6376,"CONTEXT: On December 26, 2004, an undersea earthquake occurred off the northwestern coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The tsunami that followed severely affected all 6 southwestern provinces of Thailand, where 5395 individuals died, 2991 were unaccounted for, and 8457 were injured. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression among individuals residing in areas affected by the tsunami in southern Thailand as part of a public health emergency response and rapid assessment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multistage, cluster, population-based mental health survey was conducted from February 15 to 22, 2005, of random samples of displaced (n = 371) and nondisplaced persons in Phang Nga province (n = 322) and nondisplaced persons in the provinces of Krabi and Phuket (n = 368). Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire on handheld computers. A surveillance follow-up survey of the displaced persons (n = 371) and nondisplaced persons (n = 322) in Phang Na was conducted in September 2005. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Medical Outcomes Study-36 Short-Form Health Survey SF-36 to assess self-perceived general health, bodily pain, and social and emotional functioning; the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire to assess tsunami-specific traumatic events; and the Hopkins Checklist-25 to detect symptoms of anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Participation rates for displaced and nondisplaced persons in the rapid assessment survey were 69% and 58%, respectively. Symptoms of PTSD were reported by 12% of displaced and 7% of nondisplaced persons in Phang Nga and 3% of nondisplaced persons in Krabi and Phuket. Anxiety symptoms were reported by 37% of displaced and 30% of nondisplaced persons in Phang Nga and 22% of nondisplaced persons in Krabi and Phuket. Symptoms of depression were reported by 30% of displaced and 21% of nondisplaced persons in Phang Nga and 10% of nondisplaced persons in Krabi and Phuket. In multivariate analysis, loss of livelihood was independently and significantly associated with symptoms of all 3 mental health outcomes (PTSD, anxiety, and depression). In the 9-month follow-up surveillance survey of 270 (73%) displaced and 250 (80%) nondisplaced participants in Phang Nga, prevalence rates of symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression among displaced persons decreased to 7%, 24.8%, and 16.7%, respectively, and among nondisplaced persons, prevalence rates decreased to 2.3%, 25.9%, and 14.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Among survivors of the tsunami in southern Thailand, elevated rates of symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression were reported 8 weeks after the disaster, with higher rates for anxiety and depression than PTSD symptoms.

The study sample included male U.S. Vietnam (n=433) and Iraq/Afghanistan (n=165) veterans who were seeking treatment for PTSD at an outpatient Veterans Affairs (VA) clinic. Measures included the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, the PAI, and the Conflict Tactics Scale. The sample was randomly split into two equal subsamples (n's=299) to allow for cross-validation of statistically derived factors. Parallel analysis, variable clustering analysis, and confirmatory factor analyses were used to evaluate the factor structure, and regression was used to examine the association of factor scores with self-reports of aggression over the past year. Three factors were identified: internalizing, externalizing, and substance abuse. Externalizing explained unique variance in aggression beyond PTSD symptom severity and demographic factors, while internalizing and substance abuse did not. Service era was unrelated to reports of aggression. The constructs of internalizing versus externalizing dimensions of PTSD may have utility in identifying characteristics of combat veterans in the greatest need of treatment to help manage aggressive urges.","personality assessment inventory internalizing and externalizing structure in veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder: associations with aggression",0,0

"549",3846,"Major depression is a mental disorder often preceded by exposure to chronic stress or stressful life events. Recently, animal models based on social conflict such as chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) are proposed to be more relevant to stress-induced human psychopathology compared to environmental models like the chronic mild stress (CMS). However, while CMS reproduces specifically core depressive symptoms such as anhedonia and helplessness, CSDS studies rely on the analysis of stress-induced social avoidance, addressing different neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we study comparatively the two models from a behavioural and neurochemical approach and their possible relevance to human depression. Mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to CMS or CSDS for six weeks and ten days. Anhedonia was periodically evaluated. A battery of test applied during the fourth week after the stress procedure included motor activity, memory, anxiety, social interaction and helplessness. Subsequently, we examined glutamate, GABA, 5-HT and dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and brainstem. CMS induced a clear depressive-like profile including anhedonia, helplessness and memory impairment. CSDS induced anhedonia, hyperactivity, anxiety and social avoidance, signs also common to anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorders. While both models disrupted the excitatory inhibitory balance in the prefrontal cortex, CMS altered importantly this balance in the brainstem. Moreover, CSDS decreased dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and brainstem. We suggests that while depressive-like behaviours might be associated to altered aminoacid neurotransmission in cortical and brain stem areas, CSDS induced anxiety behaviours might be linked to specific alteration of dopaminergic pathways involved in rewarding processes.

"550",439,"Major depression is a mental disorder often preceded by exposure to chronic stress or stressful life events. Recently, animal models based on social conflict such as chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) are proposed to be more relevant to stress-induced human psychopathology compared to environmental models like the chronic mild stress (CMS). However, while CMS reproduces specifically core depressive symptoms such as anhedonia and helplessness, CSDS studies rely on the analysis of stress-induced social avoidance, addressing different neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we study comparatively the two models from a behavioural and neurochemical approach and their possible relevance to human depression. Mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to CMS or CSDS for six weeks and ten days. Anhedonia was periodically evaluated. A battery of test applied during the fourth week after the stress procedure included motor activity, memory, anxiety, social interaction and helplessness.

"551",1628,"Aim: To determine peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets - T cells, helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells, natural killer cell cytotoxicity, serum cortisol concentration, and lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor expression in Croatian combat veterans diagnosed with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); and to examine the relationship between the assessed parameters and the time passed since the traumatic experience. Methods: Well-characterized group of 38 PTSD patients was compared to a group of 24 healthy civilians. Simultaneous determination of lymphocyte subsets and the expression of intracellular glucocorticoid receptor was performed using three-color flow cytometry. Natural killer cell cytotoxicity was measured by 51Cr-release assay and the serum cortisol concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay. Results: We found higher lymphocyte counts in PTSD patients than in healthy controls (2294.7 (plus or minus) 678.0/(mu)L vs 1817.2 (plus or minus) 637.0/(mu)L, P = 0.007) and a positive correlation between lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor expression and the number of years that passed from the traumatic experience (rs = 0.43, P = 0.008). Lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor expression positively correlated with serum cortisol concentration both in PTSD patients (r = 0.46, P = 0.006) and healthy controls (r = 0.46, P = 0.035). Conclusion: This study confirmed that the immune system was affected in the course of chronic PTSD. Our findings also indicated that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis profile in PTSD was associated with the duration of the disorder. Due to the lack of power, greater sample sizes are needed to confirm the results of this study.","circulating lymphocyte subsets, natural killer cell cytotoxicity, and components of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in croatian war veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder: cross-sectional study",0,0

The reviewer notes that the history of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is of a condition which has struggled to be accepted as legitimate. So it is very welcome that this National Clinical Practice Guideline on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder has been developed by an expert group under the auspices of the National Collaborating Centre for mental health--a branch of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). The guide sets out in an accessible way the research evidence for different treatments, and consensus for good practice where research evidence is lacking. It also sets out very clear recommendations for practice and future research. In some ways, the most powerful part of these guidelines are the nine personal testimonies of people who have suffered from PTSD, and two accounts of relatives with PTSD. In the reviewer's opinion, traumas associated with physical illness are not well covered; however, the book is overall easy to read and well referenced, and can be highly recommended.

"566",13041,"Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) manifests in a subset of individuals exposed to a traumatic stressor and is often accompanied by dysregulation of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis. Individuals with PTSD exhibit blunted HPA activity immediately after the traumatic event. Our laboratory has established a rodent model of stress that mimics the avoidance symptom cluster of PTSD. Animals are classified as 'Avoiders' or 'Non-Avoiders' post-stress based on avoidance of a predator-odor paired context. While the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is essential for appropriate initiation and termination of the stress response, the limbic system can also influence the HPA axis. Limbic forebrain structures such as the central amygdala (CeA) and ventral hippocampus (VH) regulate HPA responses to emotional stress. Like the PVN, the CeA and VH are rich in glucocorticoid receptors (GR). The purpose of these studies was to 1) examine whether Avoider rats exhibited HPA hypofunction at the time of stress, 2) determine whether the HPA hypofunction is the result of inability to mount an HPA response or enhanced negative feedback, and 3) measure the expression of GR elements in the brains of Avoider rats because altered corticosterone levels may affect HPA feedback processes. We hypothesized that corticosterone levels are blunted in Avoider rats post-stress and administration of corticosterone prior to stress would increase HPA activity at the moment of the stressor and decrease the magnitude and incidence of avoidance of a predator odor-paired chamber. Furthermore, we hypothesized that predator odor stress would alter expression and/or phosphorylation of GR machinery such as FK506 binding protein (BP) 51 and steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-1 in a brain region-specific manner in Avoiders relative to Non-Avoiders and unstressed Controls. Methods: To test these hypotheses, male Wistar rats (300g) underwent a place conditioning procedure to assess avoidance of an odor-paired chamber. Rats were exposed to a neutral environment one day or to predator odor (bobcat urine) the next day paired with two distinct environments. Rats were indexed for avoidance of the predator odor-paired 24 hours post-stress and classified as 'Avoiders' or 'Non-Avoiders'. In experiment 1 (n=15), a blood sample was obtained at baseline, at the end of neutral conditioning and at the end of predator odor exposure to examine circulating adrenocorticosterone hormone (ACTH) levels. In experiment 2 (n=16), rats received a subcutaneous injection of either vehicle (normal saline) or corticosterone (25 mg/kg) one hour prior to predator odor exposure. In experiment 3 (n=24), rats were sacrificed at 48 hours post-stress for Western blot analysis of total GR, phosphorylated GR (pGR), FKBP51, and SRC-1 levels in the PVN, CeA, and VH. Results: Rats that exhibit persistent (46 weeks) avoidance of a predator odor-paired context exhibit significantly attenuated corticosterone levels immediately following traumatic stress and low corticosterone at the time of stress was highly predictive of later avoidance suggesting that HPA dysregulation may play a role in the subsequent emergence of PTSD symptoms. A lower percentage (25%) of rats pre-treated with corticosterone prior to stress were classified as Avoiders, relative to saline-treated rats (75% Avoiders). In the PVN, there were no differences in GR, pGR, or FKBP51 protein levels. There was also a trend (p=0.06) toward a decrease in SRC-1 in Avoiders when compared to Non-Avoiders. PVN SRC-1 was strongly and negatively correlated with avoidance in all stressed rats. In the CeA, there were no differences in GR or pGR protein levels. There was a significant decrease in FKBP51 and SRC-1 protein content in Avoiders relative to Non-Avoiders. CeA SRC-1 content was trended to negatively correlated with avoidance in all stressed rats (r2 = 0.22; p = 0.06). In the VH, there were no differences in GR, pGR, or FKBP51 protein across groups post-stress. There was a significant increase in SRC-1 protein in Avoiders wh n compared to Control rats (p = 0.004) and Non-Avoiders (p = 0.02). VH SRC-1 content was strongly and positively correlated with avoidance in all stressed rats (r2 = 0.54; p = 0.002). Conclusions: These data suggest that low corticosterone levels in Avoiders post-stress reflect blunted HPA response to stress, although this does not preclude the possibility that negative feedback is also altered in Avoider rats. SRC-1, a protein involved in HPA negative feedback and corticotropin releasing factor gene transcription was decreased in the PVN of Avoider rats. Changes in SRC-1, in particular, in the brain regions examined were highly predictive of avoidance behavior, identifying a potential link between abnormal HPA responses to stress and subsequent stressrelated behavioral pathology. Corticosterone administration prior to stress decreased the magnitude and incidence of avoidance of a predator odor-paired chamber suggesting that the blunted HPA stress response in Avoider rats results from failure to mount and HPA response. One potential mechanism for this blunted HPA stress response is altered balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to parvocellular neurons in the PVN, a focus of ongoing studies.","post-traumatic stress avoidance is attenuated by corticosterone and associated with brain levels of steroid receptor co-activator-1 in rats",0,0
"567",13042,"Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) avoid trauma-related stimuli and exhibit blunted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation at the time of stress. Our rodent model of stress mimics the avoidance symptom cluster of PTSD. Rats are classified as ""Avoiders"" or ""Non-Avoiders"" post-stress based on the avoidance of a predator-odor paired context. Previously, we found Avoiders exhibit an attenuated HPA stress response to predator odor. We hypothesized that corticosterone administration before stress would reduce the magnitude and incidence of stress-paired context avoidance. Furthermore, we also predicted that Avoiders would exhibit altered expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling machinery elements, including steroid receptor co-activator (SRC)-1. Male Wistar rats (n = 16) were pretreated with corticosterone (25 mg/kg) or saline and exposed to predator-odor stress paired with a context and tested for avoidance 24 h later. A second group of corticosterone-naive rats (n = 24) were stressed (or not), indexed for avoidance 24 h later, and killed 48 h post-odor exposure to measure phosphorylated GR, FKBP51 and SRC-1 levels in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), central amygdala (CeA) and ventral hippocampus (VH), all brain sites that highly express GRs and regulate HPA function. Corticosterone pretreatment reduced the magnitude and incidence of avoidance. In Avoiders, predator-odor exposure led to lower SRC-1 expression in the PVN and CeA, and higher SRC-1 expression in the VH. SRC-1 expression in PVN, CeA and VH was predicted by prior avoidance behavior. Hence, a blunted HPA stress response may contribute to stress-induced neuroadaptations in central SRC-1 levels and behavioral dysfunction in Avoider rats.","post-traumatic stress avoidance is attenuated by corticosterone and associated with brain levels of steroid receptor co-activator-1 in rats",0,0

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients experience a range of acute cardiac symptoms, and these may cluster together in specific patterns. The objectives of this study were to establish distinct symptom clusters in ACS patients, and to investigate whether the experience of different types of symptom clusters are associated with posttraumatic symptom intensity at six months. ACS patients were interviewed in hospital within 48 h of admission, 294 patients provided information on symptoms before hospitalisation, and cluster analysis was used to identify patterns. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were assessed in 156 patients at six months. Three symptom clusters were identified; pain symptoms, diffuse symptoms and symptoms of dyspnea. In multiple regression analyses, adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical and psychological factors, the pain symptoms cluster ((beta) = .153, P = .044) emerged as a significant predictor of posttraumatic symptom severity at six months. A marginally significant association was observed between symptoms of dyspnea and reduced intrusive symptoms at six months ((beta) = -.156, P = .061). Findings suggest acute ACS symptoms occur in distinct clusters, which may have distinctive effects on intensity of subsequent posttraumatic symptoms. Since posttraumatic stress is associated with adverse outcomes, identifying patients at risk based on their symptom experience during ACS may be useful in targeting interventions.","symptom experience during acute coronary syndrome and the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms",0,0

"580",1045,"Background: Prolonged exposure (PE) therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in military veterans has established efficacy, but is ineffective for a substantial number of patients. PE is also associated with high dropout rates. We hypothesized that hydrocortisone augmentation would enhance symptom improvement and reduce drop-out rates by diminishing the distressing effects of traumatic memories retrieved during imaginal exposure. We also hypothesized that in responders, hydrocortisone augmentation would be more effective in reversing glucocorticoid indices associated with PTSD than placebo augmentation. Method: Twenty-four veterans were randomized to receive either 30 mg oral hydrocortisone or placebo prior to PE sessions 3-10 in a double-blind protocol. Glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity was assessed in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using the in vitro lysozyme inhibition test and was determined before and after treatment. Intent-to-treat analysis was performed using latent growth curve modeling of treatment effects on change in PTSD severity over time. Veterans who no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD at post-treatment were designated as responders. Results: Veterans randomized to hydrocortisone or placebo augmentation did not differ significantly in clinical severity or glucocorticoid sensitivity at pre-treatment. Hydrocortisone augmentation was associated with greater reduction in total PTSD symptoms compared to placebo, a finding that was explained by significantly greater patient retention in the hydrocortisone augmentation condition. A significant treatment condition by responder status interaction for glucocorticoid sensitivity indicated that responders to hydrocortisone augmentation had the highest pre-treatment glucocorticoid sensitivity (lowest lysozyme IC50-DEX) that diminished over the course of treatment. There was a significant association between decline in glucocorticoid responsiveness and improvement in PTSD symptoms among hydrocortisone recipients. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study suggest that hydrocortisone augmentation of PE may result in greater retention in treatment and thereby promote PTSD symptom improvement. Further, the results suggest that particularly elevated glucocorticoid responsiveness at pre-treatment may identify veterans likely to respond to PE combined with an intervention that targets glucocorticoid sensitivity. Confirmation of these findings will suggest that pharmacologic interventions that target PTSD-associated glucocorticoid dysregulation may be particularly helpful in promoting a positive clinical response to PTSD psychotherapy.","cortisol augmentation of a psychological treatment for warfighters with posttraumatic stress disorder: randomized trial showing improved treatment retention and outcome",0,0

"584",11721,"(from the chapter) This chapter discusses posttraumatic stress disorder in young people. Both ICD-10 and DSM-IV diagnostic systems now acknowledge that major stressors can cause serious morbidity and that children may suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The past 15 years have seen a great increase in studies of the effects of major stresses, as encountered in disasters, war and other life-threatening experiences. However, the question for child psychiatry remains whether severe acute stresses, as opposed to chronic ones linked to social adversity, carry a substantial increased risk of psychiatric sequelae. If so, what sort of stressors carry such increased risk? What are the most common psychological sequelae? Do these vary according to stressor, according to developmental level? What is the role of the family in moderating the reactions? Are there other known risk and protective factors? Indeed, is PTSD a truly separate disorder or is it merely a variant of other well-recognized disorders such as anxiety, phobias and depression? Finally, what is currently known about intervention?

"585",13071,"(from the chapter) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was first recognized as a coherent diagnostic classification in 1980 (APA, 1980) when the puzzling symptoms presented by veterans of the Vietnam War were properly described. Three groups of symptoms or reactions were identified as occurring together: distressing intrusive images and memories; emotional numbing and avoidance of traumatic reminders; and increased physiological arousal. Initially it was asserted that children would not develop PTSD but that view had been based on an absence of information gathered from children themselves. By the end of the 1980s, studies by Pynoos in USA and Yule in UK had firmly demonstrated that children and adolescents can and do develop PTSD after significant life-threatening experiences.

"588",1683,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex mental disorder that can develop in response to traumatic experiences. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology of PTSD are poorly understood, and this lack of knowledge hampers our ability to find superior therapeutic approaches to the treatment of this disorder. There are two main reasons for our lack of study in this area: here is no sufficiently validated animal model and lack of large-scale studies for the search of underlying molecular mechanisms. Thus, to promote research on PTSD (especially its molecular mechanisms) and to set molecular basis for searching novel medications of this disorder, large-scale, genome-wide interrogation of a significant amount of genes based upon a well validated animal model is demanded. We hypothesize that a significant number of genes are involved in PTSD. It is only with a large number of these genes identified in specific samples of PTSD-related population, and then it is possible for a sufficient understanding of the pathology at the molecular level of a PTSD, as well as for enhancing the PTSD's therapeutic and preventative strategies. Two prerequisites are needed for testing this hypothesis: (1) relative pure samples from a well validated animal model; and (2) genome-wide screening of PTSD molecular targets. For the animal model, we suggest to use the predator-exposure paradigm, in which rats are exposed to a predator, this model has previously been evaluated behaviorally well emulated the clinical symptoms of PTSD. For a better stringency, three criteria can be used to further validate this animal model: analogous (similarity of behavior), predictive (predictability of drug response) and biological mechanism (e.g., electrophysiological and pathological change in amygdala).

We undertook a longitudinal evaluation of dissociation in Holocaust survivors. Twenty-six Holocaust survivors with current PTSD, 30 Holocaust survivors without current PTSD, and 19 nonexposed were evaluated at the initial evaluation and subsequently 8.11 years later. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the DES scores from these times demonstrated a significant main effect for time and a significant group by time interaction, reflecting a marked decline in Holocaust survivors, particularly those with PTSD. Controlling for age obliterated the effect of time, but not the group by time interaction. A similar pattern was shown with The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores.

"592",9519,"The current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in a large cohort of military personnel exposed to combat-related psychological trauma as well as biomechanical trauma, including proximity to blast events. Historically, the long-term effects of both types of trauma have been viewed as having different neural substrates, with some controversy over the proper attribution of such symptoms evident after each of the major conflicts of the last century. Recently, great effort has been directed toward distinguishing which neuropsychiatric sequelae are due to which type of trauma. Of interest, however, is that the chronic effects of exposure to either process are associated with a significant overlap in clinical symptoms. Furthermore, similar brain regions are vulnerable to the effects of either psychological or biomechanical trauma, raising the possibility that shared mechanisms may underlie the clinically observed overlap in symptom profile. This paper reviews the literature on the neural substrate of biomechanical and psychological injury and discusses the implications for evaluation and treatment of the neuropsychiatric sequelae of these processes. © 2010 Association for Research in Nervous and Mental Disease.","effects of psychological and biomechanical trauma on brain and behavior",0,0

Trauma history and symptoms were assessed through structured clinical interviews and standardized self-report measures. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze the effects of trauma symptoms on trajectories of cortisol reactivity to and recovery from the interpersonal stress. Trauma-related anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and dissociation significantly predicted cortisol reactivity and recovery.

"594",796,"The postSeptember 11, 2001 wars in and around Afghanistan and Iraq have increased awareness of traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly blast-induced mild TBI. This article provides an overview of TBI and its neuropsychiatric sequelae in U.S. war veterans who participated in the current operations in and around Afghanistan and Iraq, with particular emphasis on blast-related mild TBI. Psychiatric disorders, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder, pain, and sensory impairments are prevalent in war veterans with TBI. Research is needed to more definitively characterize the epidemiology of TBI-related functional difficulties, the effects of blasts compared with other mechanisms of injury, recovery trajectories, and treatment outcomes in this population. © 2012 by Annual Reviews.

"595",9935,"A key assumption in the study of stress-induced cognitive and neurobiological modifications is that alterations in hippocampal functioning after stress are due to an excessive activity exerted by the amygdala on the hippocampus. Research so far focused on stress-induced impairment of hippocampal plasticity and memory but an exposure to stress may simultaneously also result in strong emotional memories. In fact, under normal conditions emotionally charged events are better remembered compared with neutral ones. Results indicate that under these conditions there is an increase in activity within the amygdala that may lead to memory of a different quality. Studying the way emotionality activates the amygdala and the functional impact of this activation we found that the amygdala modulates memory-related processes in other brain areas, such as the hippocampus. However, this modulation is complex, involving both enhancing and suppressing effects, depending on the way the amygdala is activated and the hippocampal subregion examined. The current review summarizes our findings and attempts to put them in context with the impact of an exposure to a traumatic experience, in which there is a mixture of a strong memory of some aspects of the experience but impaired memory of other aspects of that experience. Toward that end, we have recently developed an animal model for the induction of predisposition to stress-related disorders, focusing on the consequences of exposure to stressors during juvenility on the ability to cope with stress in adulthood. Exposing juvenile-stressed rats to an additional stressful challenge in adulthood revealed their impairment to cope with stress and resulted in significant elevation of the amygdala. Interestingly, and similar to our electrophysiological findings, differential effects were observed between the impact of the emotional challenge on CA1 and dentate gyrus subregions of the hippocampus. Taken together, the results indicate that long-term alterations within the amygdala contribute to stress-related mnemonic symptoms and suggest that elucidating further these intra-amygdala alterations and their effects on modulating other brain regions is likely to be beneficial for the development of novel approaches to treat stress-related disorders. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
